Diagnosis You may not know you have atrial fibrillation AFib 
The condition may be found when a health checkup is done for another reason 
This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of the heart 
Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs 
Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which prints or displays the test results 
It s worn for a day or two while you do your regular activities 
Some devices automatically record when an irregular heart rhythm is detected 
This device records the heartbeat continuously for up to three years 
The device shows how the heart is beating while you do your daily activities 
It may be used to see how often you have an AFib episode 
For example, you may need one if you ve had an unexplained stroke Echocardiogram 
Sound waves are used to create images of the beating heart 
This test can show how blood flows through the heart and heart valves 
A chest X ray shows the condition of the lungs and heart

Together, you and your health care team discuss the best treatment option for you 
MedicationsTreatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines to do the following 
Most people need additional or alternative medicines, such as calcium channel blockers or beta blockers 
Also called anti arrhythmics, this type of medicine is used sparingly 
They tend to have more side effects than other medicines to control the heart rate 
Also called anticoagulants, these medicines help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of stroke 
Blood thinners include warfarin Jantoven , apixaban Eliquis , dabigatran Pradaxa , edoxaban Savaysa and rivaroxaban Xarelto 
Cardioversion is usually done in a hospital as a scheduled procedure 
The medicine reduces the risk of blood clots and strokes 
The heart s electrical signals can t pass through the damaged area 
So this treatment blocks the faulty heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation AFib 
Once the AV node is destroyed, a pacemaker is needed to control the heart rhythm 
Cardiac ablation often uses heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart 
The scars disrupt irregular heart signals and restore a typical heartbeat 
Sensors on the tip of the catheter apply the cold or heat energy 
Less commonly, ablation is done using a scalpel during open heart surgery 
So the maze interferes with the stray heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation 
If a scalpel is used to create the maze pattern, open heart surgery is necessary 
This is a treatment for some types of continued atrial fibrillation 
The scar tissue blocks faulty electrical signals that cause AFib 
If this happens, another ablation or heart treatment may be recommended 
After cardiac ablation, lifelong blood thinners may be needed to prevent strokes 
This sac, called an appendage, is where most AFib related clots form 
A closure device is gently guided through a catheter to the sac 
Once the device is in place, the catheter is removed 
Try to get to minutes of physical activity most days of the week 
If you need help quitting, talk to your health care team 
Talk with your care provider to set realistic goals for weight 
Get your blood pressure checked at least every two years if you re and older 
If you have high blood pressure, follow your treatment plan as directed 
Ask your health care team how often you need a cholesterol test 
Lifestyle changes and medicines may be recommended to control high cholesterol 
In some people, even lower amounts of alcohol can trigger AFib 
Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions 
Adults should aim to get to hours of sleep daily 
Tell your health care team if your AFib symptoms get worse 
If AFib is found early, treatment may be easier, and it may work better 
You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases 
Here s some Information to help you prepare for your appointment 
Write down any symptoms you re having, including any that may seem unrelated to atrial fibrillation 
Note when they started, and what you were doing when they started

Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me 
Don t hesitate to ask any other questions during your appointment 
What to expect from your doctorDuring a health checkup, you are usually asked many questions 
Do you always have symptoms, or do they come and go 
A healthy lifestyle is the main protection against heart problems and heart related complications 
This is the most common test to diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms 
This test uses X rays to create cross sectional images of the structures inside the belly area 
This test also can detect the size and shape of an aneurysm 
Women who have never smoked generally don t need to be screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm 
Ask your health care provider if screening is right for you 
The goal of abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment is to prevent an aneurysm from rupturing 
Frequent health checkups and imaging, called medical monitoring or watchful waiting 
Abdominal ultrasounds also should be done at regular follow up appointments 
This treatment is most often used to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm 
The mesh tube, called a graft, expands, and strengthens the weakened area of the aorta 
Endovascular surgery isn t an option for everyone with an abdominal aortic aneurysm 
You and your health care team should discuss the best repair option for you 
Long term survival rates are similar for both endovascular surgery and open surgery 
These activities may cause extreme increases in blood pressure, which can worsen an aneurysm 
If you re feeling stressed or anxious, let your care provider know 
Together you can come up with the best treatment plan 
Here s some Information to help you get ready for your appointment 
Important personal Information, including a family history of heart disease or aneurysms 
For an abdominal aortic aneurysm, questions to ask your health care provider include 
Which do you think would be the best treatment for me 
Do I need regular screenings, and if so, how often 
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have 
Do your symptoms come and go, or do you always feel them 
Two such tests are an iodine starch test and a sweat test 
Treatment Treating hyperhidrosis may start with treating the condition causing it 
If a cause isn t found, treatment focuses on controlling heavy sweating 
Even if your sweating improves after treatment, it may recur 
Your health care provider may prescribe an antiperspirant with aluminum chloride Drysol, Xerac AC 
Talk with your health care provider about ways to reduce side effects 
Prescription creams that contain glycopyrrolate may help hyperhidrosis that affects the face and head 
Wipes soaked in glycopyrronium tosylate Qbrexza may ease symptoms of the hands, feet and underarms 
Possible side effects of these products include mild skin irritation and dry mouth 
Some pills oral medications block the nerves that trigger sweat glands 
Possible side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision and bladder problems

An EEG records the electrical activity of the brain via electrodes affixed to the scalp 
Your child s health care provider will likely ask for a detailed description of the seizures 
This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain 
Rapid breathing, known as hyperventilation, during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure 
During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the typical pattern 
Then the provider may increase the dosage as needed to control the seizures 
This is the drug most health care providers start with for absence seizures 
Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, sleep disturbances and hyperactivity 
Its side effects include nausea, attention problems, increased appetite and weight gain 
Rarely, the medicine can cause inflammation of the pancreas and liver failure 
Valproic acid has been associated with higher risk of birth defects in babies 
Providers typically advise not using it during pregnancy or while trying to conceive 
Lifestyle and home remediesDietary therapyA ketogenic diet can improve seizure control 
This diet is high in fat and low in carbohydrates 
It s used only if traditional medicines fail to control the seizures 
This diet isn t easy to maintain, but it s successful at reducing seizures for some people 
These diets include the glycemic index and modified Atkins diets 
Additional optionsHere are other steps that may help with seizure control 
Don t adjust the dosage before talking to your child s health care provider 
Ask your child s health care provider about driving or recreation restrictions 
The amount of time required since the last seizure varies from state to state 
Don t bathe or swim unless someone else is nearby to help if needed 
At schoolTalk with your child s teachers and coaches about your child s seizure disorder 
Discuss what your child might need if a seizure happens at school 
You re not aloneRemember, you don t have to go it alone 
Ask your health care provider about local support groups, or join an online support community

To test for achalasia, your doctor is likely to recommend 
Specific treatment depends on your age, health condition and the severity of the achalasia 
This outpatient procedure may need to be repeated if the esophageal sphincter doesn t stay open 
Nearly one third of people treated with balloon dilation need repeat treatment within five years 
This muscle relaxant can be injected directly into the esophageal sphincter with an endoscopic needle 
Botox injections typically do not last more than six months 
A strong improvement from injection of Botox may help confirm a diagnosis of achalasia 
Your doctor might suggest muscle relaxants such as nitroglycerin Nitrostat or nifedipine Procardia before eating 
These medications have limited treatment effect and severe side effects

Surgery for GERD may involve a procedure to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter 
In this procedure, the surgeon wraps the top of the stomach around the lower esophagus 
Your doctor is likely to recommend that you first try lifestyle changes and nonprescription medications 
Antacids containing calcium carbonate, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief 
But antacids alone won t heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid 
Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems 
If you start taking a nonprescription medication for GERD, be sure to inform your doctor 
These include esomeprazole Nexium , lansoprazole Prevacid , omeprazole Prilosec , pantoprazole Protonix , rabeprazole Aciphex and dexlansoprazole Dexilant 
Side effects from these medications are generally mild and well tolerated 
Surgery and other proceduresGERD can usually be controlled with medication

These images can detect problems in the digestive tract, such as a blockage 
Your baby may be given a contrast liquid from a bottle before the test 
For infants and children, endoscopy usually is done under general anesthesia 
MedicationsReflux medications aren t typically used to treat uncomplicated reflux in children 
Acid blocking medications include cimetidine Tagamet HB , famotidine Pepcid AC and omeprazole magnesium Prilosec 
Your child s provider may recommend an acid blocking medication if your baby 
Has poor weight gain, and changes in feeding haven t worked 
During the surgery, the LES between the esophagus and the stomach is tightened 
This prevents acid from flowing back up into the esophagus 
Then, hold your baby in a sitting position for minutes after feeding 
Be careful not to jostle or jiggle your baby while the food is settling 
Most babies should be placed on their backs to sleep, even if they have reflux

Examples include tretinoin Avita, Retin A, others , adapalene Differin and tazarotene Tazorac, Avage, others 
Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide 
These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation 
Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide Benzaclin, Duac, others and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide Benzamycin 
Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast 
Prescription azelaic acid Azelex, Finacea is an option during pregnancy and while breast feeding 
It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne 
For moderate to severe acne, you may need oral antibiotics to reduce bacteria 
Oral antibiotics should be used for the shortest time possible to prevent antibiotic resistance 
Severe side effects from the use of antibiotics to treat acne are uncommon 
They are products that combine progestin and estrogen Ortho Tri Cyclen , Yaz, others 
Common side effects of combined oral contraceptives are weight gain, breast tenderness and nausea 
It works by blocking the effect of androgen hormones on the oil producing glands 
Isotretinoin Amnesteem, Claravis, others is a derivative of vitamin A 
Potential side effects of oral isotretinoin include inflammatory bowel disease, depression and severe birth defects 
All people receiving isotretinoin must participate in an FDA approved risk management program

Diagnosis Hidradenitis suppurativa can be mistaken for pimples or acne 
For many people, it takes years to receive a correct diagnosis 
Hidradenitis suppurativa can be difficult to diagnose and requires specialized care 
MedicationsYour health care provider might prescribe one or more of these types of medicines 
People with severe disease might need to take antibiotics for months 
Triamcinolone acetonide, or Kenalog , injected into the sores might reduce swelling and inflammation 
Several of these medicines are approved to treat moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa 
Two are the tumor necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab, or Humira, and infliximab, or Remicade 
These medicines work by dampening part of the immune system called tumor necrosis factor 
Many other biologics are in clinical trials for hidradenitis suppurativa 
Oral retinoids might be an option for some people with acne like disease 
Surgery or other proceduresCombined medical and surgical approaches help manage hidradenitis suppurativa 
Talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the options, including 
This procedure involves removing tissue to expose the tunnels under the skin 
It s used for people with moderate or severe hidradenitis suppurativa 
This procedure, also called limited unroofing, involves removing a single inflamed bump 
A carbon dioxide laser can be used to make hidradenitis suppurativa sores go away 
Laser hair removal can help hidradenitis suppurativa in its early stages 
This approach might be an option for people with persistent or severe symptoms 
A skin graft might be needed to close the wound 
Even after surgery, sores might still occur in other areas 
Surgical drainage is no longer considered an effective option for treating hidradenitis suppurativa 
Early treatment is crucialSurgery for hidradenitis suppurativaTreating hidradenitis suppurativa with antibiotics and hormonesTreating hidradenitis suppurativa

This test is conducted by a hearing specialist called an audiologist 
During the test, sounds are directed to one ear at a time 
The audiologist presents a range of sounds of various tones 
Each tone is repeated at faint levels to find out when you can barely hear 
The audiologist also may present various words to test your hearing 
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI with contrast dye is usually used to diagnose an acoustic neuroma 
This imaging test can detect tumors as small as to millimeters in diameter 
There are three treatment approaches for acoustic neuroma monitoring, surgery or radiation therapy 
This may be an option if the acoustic neuroma causes few or no symptoms 
These tests can determine whether the tumor is growing and how quickly 
SurgeryYou may need surgery to remove an acoustic neuroma, especially if the tumor is 
Your surgeon may use one of several techniques for removing an acoustic neuroma 
Surgery for an acoustic neuroma is performed under general anesthesia 
Hearing may be lost on the side where the surgery is performed 
Leaking of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord, known as cerebrospinal fluid 
There are several types of radiation therapy used to treat an acoustic neuroma 
A type of radiation therapy known as stereotactic radiosurgery can treat an acoustic neuroma 
It s often used if the tumor is small less than centimeters in diameter 
This technique offers treatment without damaging the surrounding tissue or making an incision 
It may take weeks, months or years before you notice the effects of radiosurgery 
Your health care team monitors your progress with follow up imaging studies and hearing tests 
SRT is done to slow the growth of the tumor without damaging surrounding brain tissue 
This type of radiation therapy uses high energy beams of positively charged particles called protons 
The proton beams are delivered to the affected area in targeted doses to treat tumors 
This type of therapy lowers radiation exposure to the surrounding area 
Cochlear implants or other treatments can be used for hearing loss

For example, can you use that ear on the phone 
Does that ear help you tell where sound is coming from 
Do you have regular headaches currently or have you had them in the past 
Diagnosis HIV can be diagnosed through blood or saliva testing 
The immune system makes antibodies when it s exposed to HIV 
It can take weeks to months for antibodies to show up in blood 
These tests look for antibodies to HIV in blood or saliva 
These tests look for the virus in your blood, called viral load 
NAT is the first test to become positive after exposure to HIV 
Talk with your healthcare professional about which HIV test is right for you 
Find which HIV antiretroviral therapy, also called ART, is best for you 
Watch your progress and work with you to manage your health 
CD T cells are white blood cells that HIV targets and destroys 
This test measures the amount of virus in your blood 
This greatly reduces your chances of opportunistic infection and other HIV related complications 
This test helps your healthcare professional know if your form of the virus has resistance 
Once you have the infection, your body can t get rid of it 
But there are medicines that can control HIV and prevent complications 
Everyone diagnosed with HIV should take antiretroviral therapy medicines, also called ART 
ART is usually a mix of two or more medicines from several classes 
This approach has the best chance of lowering the amount of HIV in the blood 
Each class of medicines blocks the virus in different ways 
Treatment involves mixing medicines from different classes to 
Keep from creating new medicine resistant strains of HIV 
Suppress the virus in the blood as much as possible 
Examples include abacavir Ziagen , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Viread , emtricitabine Emtriva , lamivudine Epivir and zidovudine Retrovir 
HIV protease is another protein that HIV needs to make copies of itself 
Integrase inhibitors stop the action of a protein called integrase 
HIV uses integrase to put its genetic material into CD T cells 
Examples include bictegravir sodium emtricitabine tenofovir alafenamide fumarate Biktarvy , raltegravir Isentress , dolutegravir Tivicay and cabotegravir Vocabria 
Entry or fusion inhibitors block HIV s entry into CD T cells 
For ART to work, you must take the medicines as prescribed 
Let your health professional know right away if you have problems with HIV therapy 
Then you can work together to find ways to deal with those issues 
Treatment side effectsTreatment side effects can include 
After that, you see your health professional every to months 
Foodborne illnesses can be severe in people who are infected with HIV 
Don t use dairy products that aren t treated for bacteria, called pasteurized 
Don t eat raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi 
These may prevent common infections such as pneumonia, influenza, COVID and mpox 
But most vaccines with live viruses are not safe because of your weakened immune system 
Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV positive 
Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying litter boxes 
But there are no studies that show these claims are true 
And many supplements can get in the way of other medicines 
Supplements that may be helpfulThere s little evidence to show that any supplements for HIV work 
The amino acids L glutamine, L arginine and hydroxymethylbutyrate HMB , also may help with weight gain 
There is some evidence that the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii may help with HIV related diarrhea 
Too much of some vitamins and minerals can be harmful 
But garlic supplements can reduce how well some anti HIV medicines work 
Don t take it if you take a protease inhibitor or a statin 
While they need more study, these practices may be helpful if you re living with HIV AIDS 
Coping and supportGetting a diagnosis of any life threatening illness can cause distress 
But there are many services and resources for people with HIV 
You may be sent to an infectious disease specialist who focuses on treating HIV AIDS 
Do you have risk factors, such as having sex without protection or shooting illicit drugs 
If you shoot illicit drugs, always use a fresh, clean needle 
Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and conduct a physical exam 
This is the best method for confirming an acromegaly diagnosis 
But if you have acromegaly, your GH level will tend to stay high 
Doctors can remove most pituitary tumors using a method called transsphenoidal surgery

An important part of diagnosing Alzheimer s disease includes being able to explain your symptoms 
Tests of memory and thinking skills also help diagnose Alzheimer s disease 
Blood and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes of the symptoms 
Or they may help your health care professional better identify the disease causing dementia symptoms 
Physical and neurological examA health care professional will perform a physical exam 
Ability to get up from a chair and walk across the room 
Brain scans FDG PET used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease 
Areas that are black and blue represent healthy brain metabolism 
Areas that are green, yellow and red represent worsening brain metabolism as the disease progresses 
An MRI is generally preferred to a CT scan to evaluate dementia 
A CT scan, a specialized X ray technology, produces cross sectional images of your brain 
It s usually used to rule out tumors, strokes and head injuries 
Positron emission tomography PET can capture images of the disease process 
Amyloid PET imaging can measure the burden of amyloid deposits in the brain 
These tests, including blood tests, may improve accuracy when making a diagnosis 
They also may allow the disease to be diagnosed before symptoms begin 
A blood test to measure beta amyloid levels is currently available 
Genetic testing isn t recommended for most people being evaluated for Alzheimer s disease 
But people with a family history of early onset Alzheimer s disease may consider it

Treatment MedicationsAlzheimer s medicines can help with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes 
Two types of drugs are currently used to treat symptoms 
The medicines preserve a chemical messenger that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimer s disease 
These are usually the first medicines tried, and most people see modest improvements in symptoms 
Cholinesterase inhibitors may improve symptoms related to behavior, such as agitation or depression 
The medicines are taken orally or delivered through a patch on the skin 
Commonly prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors include donepezil Aricept, Adlarity , galantamine Razadyne and rivastigmine transdermal patch Exelon 
In people with certain heart disorders, serious side effects may include an irregular heartbeat 
The medicine prevents amyloid plaques in the brain from clumping 
Lecanemab is given as an IV infusion every two weeks 
Rarely, brain swelling can be serious enough to cause seizures and other symptoms 
Also in rare instances, bleeding in the brain can cause death 
The FDA recommends getting a brain MRIs before starting treatment 
The FDA recommends being tested for this gene before starting treatment with lecanemab 
Blood thinning medicines may increase the risk of bleeds in the brain 
More research is being done on the potential risks of taking lecanemab 
Establish and strengthen routine habits and cut down on tasks that require memory 
These are ways to support a person s sense of well being and continued ability to function 
Arrange for finances to be on automatic payment and automatic deposit 
Have the person with Alzheimer s carry a mobile phone with location tracking 
Ensure that shoes and slippers are comfortable and provide good traction 
People with Alzheimer s may find images in mirrors confusing or scary 
Make sure that the person with Alzheimer s carries ID or wears a medical alert bracelet 
Keep photos and other objects with meaning around the house

Some of the treatments that have been studied recently include 
However, study results have been mixed, with only some showing modest benefits 
Work closely with your health care team to create a safe treatment plan 
Omega fatty acids in fish or from supplements may lower the risk of developing dementia 
But clinical studies have shown no benefit for treating Alzheimer s disease symptoms 
So far, clinical trials have found no benefit for treating Alzheimer s disease 
It s being studied to see if it can help people with dementia manage sleep problems 
But some research has indicated that melatonin may worsen mood in some people with dementia 
Lifestyle and home remediesHealthy lifestyle choices promote good overall health 
They also may play a role in maintaining brain health 
ExerciseRegular exercise is an important part of a treatment plan 
You may find exercise programs geared to older adults on TV, the internet or DVDs 
They may also forget to drink enough, leading to dehydration and constipation 
Buy favorite healthy food options that are easy to eat 
Social engagement and activitiesSocial activities can support preserved skills and abilities 
Go to social events at senior or memory care centers 
A calm and stable home environment can help reduce behavior problems 
As a person with Alzheimer s becomes upset, the ability to think clearly declines even more 
Caring for the caregiverCaring for a person with Alzheimer s disease is physically and emotionally demanding 
Feelings of anger, guilt, stress, worry, grief and social isolation are common 
Caregiving can even take a toll on the caregiver s physical health 
If you re a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer s, you can 
Call on friends or other family members for help when you need it 
Make use of a local adult day center, if possible 
Many people with Alzheimer s and their families benefit from counseling or local support services 
In addition to providing support, your partner can provide help in answering questions 
Medical history, including any past or current diagnoses and family medical history 
medicines, including prescriptions, medicines you take without a prescription, vitamins, herbs or other supplements 
Symptoms, including specific examples of changes in memory or thinking skills 
What kinds of memory trouble and mental lapses are you having 
Are they steadily getting worse, or are they sometimes better and sometimes worse 
Do you feel depressed, sadder or more anxious than usual 
Do you have more energy than usual, less than usual or about the same 
Are you having trouble remembering health care appointments or when to take your medicines 
Did anyone else in your family ever have memory trouble 
Do you act out your dreams while sleeping punch, flail, shout, scream 
Diagnosis Ambiguous genitalia is usually diagnosed at birth or shortly after 
The cause helps guide treatment and decisions about your baby s gender 
Your doctor will likely begin by asking questions about your family and medical history 
Ultrasound of the pelvis and abdomen to check for undescended testes, uterus or vagina 
X ray studies using a contrast dye to help clarify anatomy 
However, it s important that the family wait until test results are completed 
Sometimes gender assignment can be complex and the long term impact can be difficult to predict 
When to begin treatment depends on your child s specific situation 
Ambiguous genitalia is uncommon and complex, and it may require a team of experts 
MedicationsHormone medications may help correct or compensate for the hormonal imbalance 
Other children may take hormones around the time they would normally experience puberty 
SurgeryIn children with ambiguous genitalia, surgery may be used to 
The timing of surgery will depend on your child s specific situation 
For boys, surgery to reconstruct an incomplete penis may normalize appearance and make erections possible 
Surgery to reposition the testes into the scrotum may be required 
Results of surgery are often satisfying, but repeat surgeries may be needed later 
Mental health professionals can help you deal with this difficult and unexpected challenge

X ray, CT and MRI scans help doctors determine the extent of an ameloblastoma 
The tumor can sometimes be found on routine X rays at the dentist s office 
An aggressive approach to surgery reduces the risk that ameloblastoma will come back 
If surgery involves removing part of your jawbone, surgeons can repair and reconstruct the jaw 
This can help improve how your jaw looks and works afterward 
The surgery can also help you to be able to eat and speak 
These specialists may include dietitians, speech and language therapists, and physical therapists 
Due to the risk of recurrence after treatment, lifelong, regular follow up appointments are important 
Amenorrhea can be a sign of a complex set of hormonal problems 
Low levels of the hormone prolactin may be a sign of a pituitary gland tumor 
This test uses sound waves to produce images of internal organs 
Your doctor may order an MRI to check for a pituitary tumor 
Treatment Treatment depends on the underlying cause of your amenorrhea 
In some cases, birth control pills or other hormone therapies can restart your menstrual cycles 
Amenorrhea caused by thyroid or pituitary disorders may be treated with medications 
If a tumor or structural blockage is causing the problem, surgery may be necessary 
More Information Combination birth control pillsMinipill progestin only birth control pill 
For amenorrhea, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Do you have any Information al brochures on this topic 
Your health care provider may ask you several questions to help understand the memory loss 
The type of memory loss and whether it s recent or long term 
Factors that triggered memory problems, such as a head injury, stroke or surgery 
Cognitive testsThe exam typically includes tests related to thinking, judgment, and recent and long term memory 
You may be asked to repeat a list of words 
Blood tests to check for infection, nutritional deficiencies or other issues 
An electroencephalogram EEG to check for the presence of seizure activity 
It s also important to address underlying diseases causing the amnesia 
Or you may use intact memories as a basis for taking in new Information 
Low tech memory aids include notebooks, wall calendars, pill minders, and photographs of people and places 
Medications or supplementsNo medicines are currently available for treating most types of amnesia 
If Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome is the cause of the amnesia, treatment can help prevent further damage 
But most people won t recover all of their lost memory 
Research may one day lead to new treatments for memory disorders 
It can be helpful to talk with others who understand what you re going through 
They may be able to provide advice or tips on living with amnesia 
It s a good idea to arrive at your appointment well prepared

Diagnosis Tests and procedures used to diagnose ampullary cancer include 
Passing a thin, flexible scope down the throat, called an endoscopy 
Tiny tools passed through the catheter also can be used to remove gallstones 
It uses a long, thin tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope 
The endoscope passes down the throat, through the stomach and into the small intestine 
It allows the healthcare team to see the ampulla of Vater 
Special tools can pass through the endoscope to collect a sample of tissue for testing 
For instance, endoscopic ultrasound may help capture images of ampullary cancer 
Sometimes a dye is injected into the bile duct using endoscopy 
It can help look for blockages in the bile duct or pancreatic duct 
They can show the location and size of ampullary cancer 
The sample is tested in a lab to see if it is cancer 
Other special tests give more details about the cancer cells 
Healthcare teams use this Information to make a treatment plan 
Treatment Ampullary cancer treatment often starts with surgery to remove the cancer 
These other treatments can be done before or after surgery 
The best treatment for your ampullary cancer depends on several factors 
These include the size of the cancer, your overall health and your preferences 
The Whipple procedure can be done using a large incision in the abdomen 
Sometimes the goal of surgery is to make you more comfortable 
This tube helps drain the fluid that causes a yellowing of the skin and eyes 
Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines Radiation therapy treats cancer with powerful energy beams 
The energy can come from X rays, protons or other sources 
Used together, these treatments may be more effective for ampullary cancers 
Chemotherapy is sometimes used after surgery to kill cancer cells that might remain 
Targeted therapy uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells 
By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die 
Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells 
If you have cancer, palliative care can help relieve pain and other symptoms 
The care team s goal is to improve quality of life for you and your family 
Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your care team 
They provide an extra layer of support while you have cancer treatment 
Learn enough about ampullary cancer to make decisions about your care 
Keeping your close relationships strong will help you deal with your ampullary cancer 
And they can serve as emotional support when you feel overwhelmed by having cancer 
Find someone who is willing to listen to you talk about your hopes and fears 
Ask your healthcare team about support groups in your area 
Because appointments can be brief, it s a good idea to be prepared 
Make a list of all medicines, vitamins or supplements you re taking and the doses 
Precise diagnosis is important because treatment varies greatly, depending on your specific condition 
Laboratory testsBlood and urine may be analyzed for abnormal protein that can indicate amyloidosis 
People with certain symptoms may also need thyroid and kidney function tests 
BiopsyA tissue sample can be checked for signs of amyloidosis 
The tissue can be tested to see what type of amyloid is involved 
Imaging testsImages of the organs affected by amyloidosis may include 
It can also show heart damage that can be specific to particular types of amyloidosis 
These can be used to check the structure and function of the heart 
In this test, tiny amounts of radioactive material tracers are injected into a vein 
This can reveal early heart damage caused by certain types of amyloidosis 
It can also help distinguish between different types of amyloidosis, which can guide treatment decisions 
But treatment can help manage signs and symptoms and limit further production of amyloid protein 
You may also need medications to control your heart rate 
Drugs that increase urination can reduce the strain on your heart and kidneys 
The stem cells are then returned to your body via a vein 
If your kidneys have been damaged by amyloidosis, you may need to start dialysis 
What types of side effects can I expect from treatment 
Do I need to follow any dietary or activity restrictions 
How severe are they, and are they continuous or occasional 
Are you able to work and perform normal daily tasks 
Has anyone in your family ever been diagnosed with amyloidosis 
Diagnosis Tests and procedures used to diagnose anal cancer include 
They can show the location and size of the cancer 
Special tools can go through the anoscope to collect the cells 
Your healthcare team uses this Information to make a treatment plan 
The stages of anal cancer range from to 
The lowest number means that the cancer is small and only in the anal canal 
A stage anal cancer has spread to other areas of the body 
More Information Anal cancer care at CT scanMRIPositron emission tomography scanUltrasoundX rayShow more related Information 
Treatment Anal cancer treatment often starts with chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
When the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, different treatments might be used 
The treatment that s best for you depends on several factors 
These include the stage of your cancer, your overall health and your own preferences 
Combined chemotherapy and radiationAnal cancer is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation 
Together, these two treatments enhance each other to kill cancer cells 
Some are injected in a vein and others come in pill form 
SurgerySurgery might be used to treat anal cancer in certain situations 
Though it s not common, some very small anal cancers are treated with surgery alone 
The surgeon removes the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it 
Depending on your cancer, chemotherapy and radiation after surgery also may be recommended 
During APR the surgeon removes the anal canal, rectum and part of the colon 
Waste leaves the body through the stoma and collects in a colostomy bag 
Chemotherapy medicines can control the growth of cancer cells throughout the body 
The team s goal is to improve quality of life for you and your family 
Alternative medicine Alternative medicine treatments won t kill cancer cells 
Your healthcare team can treat many side effects, but sometimes medicines aren t enough 
Anxiety massage, meditation, hypnosis, music therapy, exercise or relaxation techniques 
Coping and supportPeople facing a serious illness often say they feel worried about the future 
Also ask your healthcare team for reliable sources where you can get more Information 
Your cancer diagnosis can be stressful for friends and family too 
Find someone you can talk to who has experience helping people facing a life threatening illness 
Often this is a surgeon or doctor who treats digestive diseases, called a gastroenterologist 
Is there one treatment that s best for my type and stage of cancer 
Diagnosis ed yesterday with colorectal cancer, what can I expect 
Usually this exam is all that s needed to diagnose an anal fissure 
A long lasting, also called chronic, anal fissure likely has a deeper tear 
A fissure is considered chronic if it lasts more than eight weeks 
Your provider may recommend further testing to find out if you have an underlying condition 
This test involves inserting a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon 
Treatment Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks with appropriate home treatment 
This can help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing 
Nitroglycerin is generally considered the treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail 
Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine Xylocaine may help relieve pain 
OnabotulinumtoxinA Botox injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms 
Blood pressure medicines, such as nifedipine or diltiazem, to help relax the anal sphincter 
These medicines are generally applied to the skin but also can be taken by mouth 
However when taken by mouth, their side effects can be greater 
These medicines may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects 
Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy LIS 
LIS involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle 
This technique may help promote healing and reduce spasm and pain 
Studies show that surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment for chronic fissure 
Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually 
Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear 
If your infant has an anal fissure, change diapers frequently and wash the area gently 
Also, be sure to discuss the problem with your child s health care provider 
Write down key personal Information, including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history 
Bring a list of all medicines, vitamins or other supplements you take, including the doses 
Do you have any other medical conditions, such as Crohn s disease 
The extra pressure may lengthen the fissure or create a new one 
The exam includes looking at the area around and inside your anus 
Finding the fistula s internal opening inside the anal canal is more complicated 
Knowing the complete path of an anal fistula is important for effective treatment 
A colon and rectal surgeon may recommend anesthesia during an examination of the fistula 
A small endoscope is used to view the anal canal 
These procedures use an endoscope to examine the large intestine colon 
Sigmoidoscopy can evaluate the lower part of the colon sigmoid colon 
Although surgery is usually required, sometimes nonsurgical treatments may be an option 
The surgeon creates a flap from the rectal wall before removing the fistula s internal opening 
This procedure can reduce the amount of sphincter muscle that is cut 
LIFT is a two stage treatment for more complex or deep fistulas 
Several weeks later, the surgeon removes infected tissue and closes the internal fistula opening 
The surgeon places a seton into the fistula to help drain the infection 
The surgeon clears the tunnel and stitches shut the internal opening 
In cases of complex anal fistula, more invasive surgical procedures may be recommended, including 
Add fiber to your diet and drink plenty of liquid to prevent constipation 
Your symptoms, even if they may seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment 
Key personal Information, including major stresses, recent life changes, and personal and family medical history 
All medications, vitamins, herbs or other supplements you take, including the dosages 
What to expect from your doctorYour health care provider may ask 
You may need a physical exam, including a rectal exam 
You might have a test for pinworms if a pinworm infection is suspected 
Treatment Treatment of anal itching depends on the cause of the problem 
If symptoms are worse at night, an oral antihistamine might be prescribed 
This is medicine that you take by mouth 
It can help give relief until an anti itch cream takes effect 
With proper care most people get relief from anal itching 
If you already have anal itching, try these self care steps to ease your symptoms 
This may involve a quick shower, a bidet, a sitz bath or a squeeze bottle 
Using the heat setting could further irritate this delicate area 
Avoid wearing pantyhose and other tight fitting garments because these can trap moisture 
Fiber supplements such as psyllium Metamucil and methylcellulose Citrucel may help 
But if the itching doesn t stop even after taking self care measures, seek help 
What you can doBefore your appointment, make a list of 
Symptoms you are having, including any that may seem unrelated to anal itching 
All medicines, vitamins and supplements you take, including the doses 
For anal itching, some basic questions to ask your care provider include 
Do you have any brochures or other printed material that I can take with me 
Have your symptoms been continuous, or do they come and go 
Have you had recent changes in your bowel movements, such as diarrhea 
What type of soap or other products do you use on your body 
Have you noticed any other changes in your general health 
But they re generally between and for men and and for women 
A test to show the size and shape of the red blood cells 
This looks at the size, shape and color of the red blood cells 
Sometimes, it can be necessary to study a sample of bone marrow to diagnose anemia 
People who have trouble absorbing vitamin B from food might need vitamin B shots 
In time, the shots will be shots just once a month, possibly for life 
Treatment for this type of anemia focuses on the disease that s causing it 
A bone marrow transplant might be needed if bone marrow can t make healthy blood cells 
Managing hemolytic anemias includes stopping medicines that might be causing it and treating infections 
Receiving blood, called a transfusion, and taking folic acid supplements and antibiotics might be involved 
Most forms of thalassemia are mild and need no treatment

If so, how often, and how many drinks do you have 
Ask your health care provider if screening is right for you 
The tests also can determine if you ve had another type of stroke 
You also may be given tests if you show symptoms of an unruptured brain aneurysm 
These symptoms may include pain behind the eye, changes in vision or double vision 
Screening tests and procedures used to diagnose and detect brain aneurysms include 
The test produces images that are D slices of the brain 
The test involves injecting dye that makes it easier to observe blood flow 
The images can show if there s bleeding in the brain 
This type of MRI can detect the size, shape and location of an unruptured aneurysm 
During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is used 
The catheter is inserted into a large artery, usually in the groin or the wrist 
The catheter threads past your heart to the arteries in your brain 
A special dye injected into the catheter travels to arteries throughout your brain 
A disorder that increases your risk of developing a brain aneurysm 
These disorders include polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta or Ehlers Danlos syndrome, among others 
And for many people, an unruptured aneurysm never causes symptoms 
About of people who experience a ruptured aneurysm die within hours 
Another have complications that lead to death within six months

Treatment Repairing a ruptured aneurysm requires surgery or endovascular treatment 
Endovascular treatment means an aneurysm is treated from inside the artery 
If you have an unruptured aneurysm, talk with your health care provider about possible treatments 
There are two common treatment options for repairing a ruptured brain aneurysm 
In some cases, these procedures may be considered to treat an unruptured aneurysm 
However, the known risks may outweigh the potential benefits for people with some unruptured aneurysms 
Surgical clipping is a procedure to close off an aneurysm 
The neurosurgeon removes a section of your skull to access the aneurysm 
The neurosurgeon then locates the blood vessel that feeds the aneurysm 
Recovery from surgical clipping usually takes about to weeks 
The wire coils inside the aneurysm and seals off the aneurysm from the artery 
Then the surgeon threads it through the body to the aneurysm 
A coil shaped like a spiral is placed inside the aneurysm 
The coil also causes the blood that s in the aneurysm to clot 
Other endovascular methods may be used depending on the location and size of the aneurysm 
Also there s a risk that the aneurysm may again appear over time 
You ll likely need follow up imaging tests to be sure the aneurysm hasn t returned 
Flow diversionFlow diversion is a newer endovascular treatment option for treatment of a brain aneurysm 
With less blood flow going to the aneurysm, there s less risk of rupture 
The stent prompts the body to grow new cells that seal the aneurysm 
A neurosurgeon or interventional neuroradiologist will likely work with your neurologist to recommend treatment 
They also may consider factors such as your ability to undergo a procedure 
Pain relievers, such as acetaminophen Tylenol, others , may be used to treat headache pain 
Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering cells of the blood vessel walls 
This can happen after subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm 
A drug can be given to dilate the blood vessels 
This can help prevent a stroke by allowing the blood to flow freely 
Blood vessels also can be expanded using medicines known as a vasodilators 
Anti seizure medicines may be used to treat seizures related to a ruptured aneurysm 
The medicines typically aren t given if a seizure hasn t occurred 
Or it can be placed in the area surrounding the brain and spinal cord 
The catheter drains the excess fluid into an external bag 
The drainage channels starts in the brain and ends in the abdominal cavity 
However, the risk of rupture is extremely low in some unruptured aneurysms 
In these cases, the known risks of the procedures may outweigh the potential benefits 
The aneurysm size, location and overall appearance of the aneurysm 
Conditions you were born with that increase the risk of a ruptured aneurysm 
Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for formation, growth and rupture of the aneurysm 
Your provider can suggest strategies or a treatment program to help you quit 
Control your blood pressure if you have high blood pressure 
Changes in diet and exercise can help lower blood pressure 
Talk to your health care provider about changes that are appropriate for you 
If you do use these drugs and would like to quit, talk to your provider 
Preparing for your appointmentBrain aneurysms are often detected after they ve ruptured and become medical emergencies 
However, a brain aneurysm may be detected when you ve undergone head imaging tests for another condition 
What do you know about the size, location and overall appearance of the aneurysm 
Do the imaging test results provide evidence of how likely it is to rupture 
If I wait, how often will I need to have follow up tests 
What steps can I take to lower the risk of an aneurysm rupturing 
Do you take your medicines as prescribed by your health care provider 
Is there a history of brain aneurysm or brain aneurysm rupture in your family 
Changes in skin color or temperature on the lower leg and behind the knee 
You may be asked questions about your medical history and health habits, such as smoking 
TestsImaging tests can help confirm a diagnosis of popliteal artery aneurysm 
This test uses sound waves to see how blood flows through the arteries and veins 
It s a simple and quick way to diagnose popliteal artery aneurysm 
These tests take detailed images of blood flow in the arteries 
Before the images are taken, dye called contrast is injected into a blood vessel 
Treatment Treatment of popliteal artery aneurysm depends on 
medicines Aspirin or another blood thinner is usually prescribed for people with popliteal artery aneurysm 
Sometimes, a less invasive procedure called endovascular repair may be done 
During this treatment, a stent is placed inside the popliteal artery to hold it open 
TestsImaging tests can be used to confirm or screen for a thoracic aortic aneurysm 
An echocardiogram may be used to diagnose or screen for thoracic aortic aneurysms 
CT uses X rays to create cross sectional images of the body, including the aorta 
It can show the size and shape of an aneurysm 
During a CT scan, you typically lie on a table inside a doughnut shaped X ray machine 
It can help diagnose an aneurysm and show its size and location 
In this test, you typically lie on a table that slides into a tunnel 
A health care provider prepares a person for an MRI scan 
Treatment depends on the aneurysm s size and how fast it s growing 
An imaging test also may be done at regular follow up exams 
Medicationsmedicines may be prescribed to treat high blood pressure and high cholesterol 
These medicines lower blood pressure by slowing the heart rate 
They may reduce how fast the aorta is widening in people with Marfan syndrome 
Examples of angiotensin receptor blockers include losartan Cozaar , valsartan Diovan and olmesartan Benicar 
Examples of statins include atorvastatin Lipitor , lovastatin Altoprev , simvastatin Zocor, FloLipid and others 
If you smoke or chew tobacco, it s important that you quit 
An ascending aortic root aneurysm procedure may be done in two ways 
A metal mesh tube called a graft is on the end of the catheter 
The graft strengthens the weakened section of the aorta to prevent rupture of the aneurysm 
This surgery generally involves removing part of the aorta damaged by the aneurysm 
A surgeon removes part of the aorta and sometimes the aortic valve 
The aortic valve may be replaced with a mechanical or biological valve 
If the valve is not removed, the surgery is called valve sparing aortic root repair 
The graft reinforces the weakened section of the aorta to prevent rupture of the aneurysm 
Ask your health care provider whether it s right for you 
After EVAR, you ll need regular imaging tests to check the graft for leakage 
This type of surgery is risky and has a high chance of complications 
Such activities can increase blood pressure, putting additional pressure on your aneurysm 
Stress also can raise blood pressure, so find ways to help reduce emotional stress 
Getting more exercise and practicing mindfulness are some ways to reduce stress 
You may find that connecting with others who have experienced similar situations may be helpful 
Talk to your health care provider about support groups in your area 
If an aneurysm is found early, treatment may be easier and more effective 
Make a list of all medicines, vitamins or supplements that you take 
Someone who goes with you may remember something that you missed or forgot 
Be prepared to discuss your diet, exercise habits and tobacco use 
Be sure to tell your health care provider if you re a current or former smoker 
For an aortic aneurysm, some basic questions to ask your health care provider include 
What kinds of tests will I need to confirm a thoracic aortic aneurysm 
Should I tell other family members to be screened for an aneurysm 
What websites do you recommend visiting for more Information 
Do your symptoms come and go, or do you have them all the time 
Do you have a family history of aneurysms or genetic diseases, such as Marfan syndrome 
Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure 
Taking these steps can help prevent thoracic aortic aneurysm and its complications 
Symptoms might include seizures, trouble with movement and balance or a small head size 
This gene testing can find changes in a child s chromosomes that indicate Angelman syndrome 
A mix of gene tests can show the changes linked to Angelman syndrome 
A chromosomal microarray CMA can show if parts of chromosomes are missing 
Depending on your child s symptoms, treatment for Angelman syndrome may involve 
Physical or occupational therapy to help with walking and movement 
Communication and speech therapy, which may include sign language and picture communication 
Diet changes and medicines to help with issues such as feeding troubles and constipation 
Coping and supportFinding out that your child has Angelman syndrome can be hard 
Ask your child s healthcare professional about local support groups and other helpful organizations 
Write down symptoms you ve seen in your child, and when they began 
Bring baby books and other records of your child s development to the appointment 
List the names of medicines, vitamins or supplements your child takes, including doses 
Ask a family member or friend to join you for your child s appointment 
or I be tested for the gene changes that are linked to this condition 
How can I find other families who are coping with Angelman syndrome 
Does your child laugh, smile or get excited more often than peers 
Does your child have odd behaviors, such as hand flapping 
These tests look for signs of inflammation, such as a high level of C reactive protein 
A complete blood cell count can tell whether you have enough red blood cells 
Noninvasive imaging techniques can help determine which blood vessels and organs are affected 
They can also help the doctor monitor whether you are responding to treatment 
The outlines of your blood vessels are visible on the resulting X rays 
Your doctor then examines this tissue for signs of vasculitis 
Possible side effects include weight gain, diabetes and weakened bones 
If a corticosteroid is needed for long term therapy, you ll likely receive the lowest dose possible 
The medication used depends on the type of vasculitis that is present 
This bulge may need surgery to reduce the risk of it rupturing 
Blocked arteries also may require surgical treatment to restore blood flow to the affected area 
In addition, many people find that exercise improves their mood and overall sense of well being

A chest X ray shows the condition of the heart and lungs 
A cardiac enzyme blood test can help detect these substances 
Sometimes angina is easier to diagnose when the heart is working harder 
Other tests may be done at the same time as a stress test 
An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create images of the heart in motion 
These images can show how blood flows through the heart 
A special scanner shows how the tracer moves through the heart arteries 
Areas that have little or no amounts of the tracer suggest poor blood flow 
For this test, you typically lie on a table inside a doughnut shaped machine 
This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart 
Coronary angiography uses X ray imaging to examine the inside of the heart s blood vessels 
It s part of a general group of procedures known as cardiac catheterization 
The dye makes the heart arteries show up more clearly on an X ray 
Your health care provider might call this type of X ray an angiogram

MedicationMedication may be prescribed to control blood pressure before and, sometimes, after repair surgery 
Surgery or other proceduresThere are several procedures and surgeries to repair aortic coarctation 
Sometimes it s done if narrowing occurs again after coarctation surgery 
It s moved through the blood vessels to the heart using X rays as a guide 
The inflated balloon widens the aorta, so blood flows more easily 
The stent helps keep the artery open, decreasing the chance of narrowing again 
Patch aortoplasty is useful if the coarctation involves a long part of the aorta

A member of your health care team may apply gentle pressure on the painful area 
When the pressure is suddenly released, appendicitis pain will often feel worse 
This is because of inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity, called the peritoneum 
This test checks for a high white blood cell count 
A high white blood cell count may indicate an infection 
You may have to take a urine test, also called a urinalysis 
Treatment Appendicitis treatment usually involves surgery to remove the appendix 
Before surgery, you may be given antibiotics to treat infection 
Surgery to remove the appendixAppendectomy is a surgery to remove the appendix 
The surgery also can be done through a few small abdominal cuts 
It may be better for older adults and people with obesity

If you have atrial fibrillation, blood thinners may be given to prevent blood clots 
These are simple but specific actions that can slow the heart rate 
Cardioversion is typically used when vagal maneuvers and medicines don t work 
The scarring blocks faulty electrical signals that cause an irregular heartbeat 
If the device finds a slow heartbeat, it sends electrical signals to correct the beat 
If it finds one, it sends a brief shock to reset the heart rhythm 
Sometimes, open heart surgery is needed to stop or prevent an irregular heartbeat 
Types of procedures and surgeries used to treat heart arrhythmias include 
The scars block irregular heart signals and restore the heartbeat 
This device is placed under the skin near the collarbone 
This treatment can block stray electrical heart signals that cause some types of fast heartbeats

It s done to check for atherosclerosis in the arteries in the legs and feet 
This test can show if the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked 
The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on images taken during the test 
When calcium is present, the higher the score, the higher the risk of heart disease 
These tests can show hardening and narrowing of large arteries, as well as aneurysms 
Statins are commonly used to lower cholesterol, improve artery health and prevent atherosclerosis 
You may need more than one type of cholesterol medication 
Don t start taking a daily aspirin without talking to your health care provider 
Instead they prevent or treat complications related to the disease 
For example, certain blood pressure medications can help reduce the risk of a heart attack 
Surgery or other proceduresSometimes more aggressive treatment is needed to treat atherosclerosis 
A mesh tube stent is typically used to keep the artery open 
Sometimes, surgery is needed to remove plaque from the walls of a narrowed artery 
The blood then goes around the blocked or narrowed coronary artery 
It s usually done only in those with many narrowed heart arteries 
Smoking is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease 
Nicotine tightens blood vessels and forces the heart to work harder 
Being overweight increases the risk of coronary artery disease, which is caused by atherosclerosis 
Losing even a small amount of weight can help reduce the risk

This test uses a series of X rays to create detailed pictures of the heart 
More Information Atrial septal defect ASD care at Cardiac catheterizationEchocardiogramElectrocardiogram ECG or EKG MRIX rayShow more related Information 
Treatment Treatment for atrial septal defect ASD depends on 
An atrial septal defect may close on its own during childhood 
For small holes that don t close, regular health checkups may be the only care needed 
Some atrial septal defects that do not close need a procedure to close the hole 
But closure of an ASD isn t recommended in those who have severe pulmonary hypertension 
Blood thinners, called anticoagulants, to lower the risk of blood clots 
Diuretics to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs and other parts of the body 
Atrial septal defect repair involves closing the hole in the heart 
This type is done to fix the secundum type of atrial septal defects 
Heart tissue grows around the patch, closing the hole for life 
However, some large secundum atrial septal defects might need open heart surgery 
Sometimes, atrial septal defect repair can be done using smaller cuts than traditional surgery 
These appointments are to watch for possible heart and lung complications 
They also are at greater risk for irregular heartbeats and pulmonary hypertension 
More Information Atrial septal defect ASD care at Cardiac catheterizationMinimally invasive heart surgery 
This includes eating healthy, not smoking, managing weight and getting enough sleep 
Exercise is usually OK for people with an atrial septal defect 
Ask a healthcare professional what type and amount of exercise is safest 
The lower amount of oxygen changes blood flow through the lung arteries 
This can cause shortness of breath and strain the heart 
This type of healthcare professional is called a congenital cardiologist 
Your or your child s symptoms, and when you noticed them 
Is the atrial septal defect likely to close on its own 
What to expect from your doctorYour healthcare professional is likely to ask questions, including 
Do you or your child always have symptoms or do they come and go 
Is there anything that seems to make the symptoms better 
If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it s likely you have asthma 
When inhaled, it will cause your airways to narrow slightly 
If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma 
This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal 
Allergy tests can be performed by a skin test or blood test 
They tell you if you re allergic to pets, dust, mold or pollen 
If allergy triggers are identified, your doctor may recommend allergy shots 
This test measures the amount of the gas nitric oxide in your breath 
Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose colored dye 
Your doctor will also consider the results of your physical exam and diagnostic tests 
Determining your asthma severity helps your doctor choose the best treatment 
Mild symptoms up to two days a week and up to two nights a month 
Symptoms more than twice a week, but no more than once in a single day 
Symptoms once a day and more than one night a week 
Symptoms throughout the day on most days and frequently at night 
Treatment Prevention and long term control are key to stopping asthma attacks before they start 
In case of an asthma flare up, you may need to use a quick relief inhaler 
Preventive, long term control medications reduce the swelling inflammation in your airways that leads to symptoms 
Quick relief inhalers bronchodilators quickly open swollen airways that are limiting breathing 
Long term asthma control medications, generally taken daily, are the cornerstone of asthma treatment 
Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects 
Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions 
It s not used as often as other asthma medications and requires regular blood tests 
They may also be used before exercise if your doctor recommends it 
These inhaled, quick relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack 
They include albuterol ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others and levalbuterol Xopenex, Xopenex HFA

If you have an asthma flare up, a quick relief inhaler can ease your symptoms right away 
Keep a record of how many puffs you use each week 
Allergy medications may help if your asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies 
Over time, allergy shots gradually reduce your immune system reaction to specific allergens 
Your doctor should ask about your symptoms at each visit 
Based on your signs and symptoms, your doctor can adjust your treatment accordingly 
For example, if your asthma is well controlled, your doctor may prescribe less medication 
Air conditioning also lowers indoor humidity and can reduce your exposure to dust mites 
If you don t have air conditioning, try to keep your windows closed during pollen season 
Minimize dust that may worsen nighttime symptoms by replacing certain items in your bedroom 
For example, encase pillows, mattresses and box springs in dustproof covers 
Throughout the house, remove carpeting and install hardwood or linoleum flooring 
If you live in a damp climate, talk to your doctor about using a dehumidifier

What you can doThese steps can help you make the most of your appointment 
For asthma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Is asthma the most likely cause of my breathing problems 
Do you have allergies, such as atopic dermatitis or hay fever 
Tests to measure how well your lungs are working may include 
This device measures how quickly you can force air out of your lungs 
Peak flow readings are usually a percentage of how your lungs work at their best 
Your FEV measurement is compared with the typical FEV for people who don t have asthma 
As with your peak flow reading, this comparison is often given as a percentage 
This shows how well the lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood 
This test would likely not be used in emergency care 
At home treatment may be enough to improve symptoms and make breathing easier 
The yellow zone of the plan also will tell you 
When to take a pill called an oral corticosteroid to treat inflammation 
You may be instructed to go to the clinic or emergency room

The type of bladder cancer that most patients are diagnosed with is urothelial carcinoma 
Some urothelial carcinomas have what s called variant histology, and these can be plasmacytoid, micropapillary, microcystic 
These are tumors that generally increase the aggressiveness of the urothelial carcinoma 
The treatment options depend on the grade and stage of your tumor 
Patients who have stage bladder cancer are generally treated with first line cisplatin based combination chemotherapy 
With a robotic approach, though, there are tiny laparoscopic incisions 
And I encourage patients to go with the surgery that feels right for themselves 
So, when we remove the bladder, we have to reroute the urine somewhere 
There s no external drainage bag for urine, like there is with an ileal conduit 
And these are important considerations as one is deciding between a neobladder and a conduit 
It s simple and it s easy to learn how to use 
There s no getting up at night to use the restroom 
And anything that you were doing before surgery, you can do after 
This includes scuba diving, skydiving, water skiing, golfing, hiking, biking 
Lots of patients ask the question of what s the right diversion for me 
For individuals who are looking for simplicity, the ileal conduit is the right choice 
For non muscle invasive bladder cancer, we generally treat with intravesicle therapy 
They also involve catheterizations and can be painful during administrations 
How can I be the best partner to my medical team 
Patients who are invested in their care are the easiest to take care of 
Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have 
Surgical tools can be passed through the cystoscope to treat certain urinary tract conditions 
Tests and procedures used to diagnose bladder cancer may include

Cystoscopy can be done in a doctor s office or in the hospital 
This procedure is sometimes called transurethral resection of bladder tumor TURBT 
The dye then flows into your kidneys while X ray images are captured 
Your doctor uses Information from these procedures to assign your cancer a stage 
The stages of bladder cancer are indicated by Roman numerals ranging from to IV 
More Information Bladder cancer care at Bone scanChest X raysComputerized tomography CT urogramCT 
Targeted therapy, to treat advanced cancer when other treatments haven t helped 
The medication remains in your bladder for a period of time and then is drained 
Cystectomy is surgery to remove all or part of the bladder 
In men, radical cystectomy typically includes removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles 
Your surgeon creates a sphere shaped reservoir out of a piece of your intestine 
Chemotherapy treatment for bladder cancer usually involves two or more chemotherapy drugs used in combination 
Chemotherapy may also be used to kill cancer cells that might remain after surgery 
In certain situations, chemotherapy may be combined with radiation therapy 
During intravesical chemotherapy, a tube is passed through your urethra directly to your bladder 
ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy is a drug treatment that helps your immune system to fight cancer 
BCG causes an immune system reaction that directs germ fighting cells to the bladder 
These drugs help your immune system identify and fight the cancer cells 
Targeted therapyTargeted therapy drugs focus on specific weaknesses present within cancer cells 
By targeting these weaknesses, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die 
Known as trimodality therapy, this approach combines TURBT, chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
After TURBT, you undergo a regimen of chemotherapy along with radiation therapy 
After bladder cancer treatmentBladder cancer may recur, even after successful treatment 
Because of this, people with bladder cancer need follow up testing for years after successful treatment 
Your doctor may recommend other tests at regular intervals as well 
Those with less aggressive cancers may undergo testing less often 
Over time you ll find what works for you, but until then, you might 
Get a schedule of follow up tests and go to each appointment 
Before each follow up cystoscopy exam, expect to have some anxiety 
You may fear that cancer has come back or worry about the uncomfortable exam 
But don t let this stop you from going to your appointment 
Take care of yourself so that you re ready to fight cancer if it comes back 
Exercise for at least minutes most days of the week 
Connect with bladder cancer survivors who are experiencing the same fears you re feeling 
Your doctor may suggest tests and procedures to investigate your signs and symptoms 
Make a list of all medications, vitamins or supplements that you re taking along with dosages 
Sometimes it s difficult to remember all of the Information provided during an appointment 
Do I have bladder cancer or could my symptoms be caused by another condition 
Is there one treatment that you feel is best for me 
Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough history and physical exam 
You re asked to urinate void into a container that measures urine output 
If an underlying condition is causing your symptoms, your doctor will first treat that condition 
Bladder training, to delay urination after you get the urge to go 
Double voiding means urinating, then waiting a few minutes and trying again 
Fluid and diet management, to regain control of your bladder 
You may need to cut back on or avoid alcohol, caffeine or acidic foods 
Reducing liquid consumption, losing weight or increasing physical activity also can ease the problem 
The female pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic organs, including the uterus, bladder and rectum 
The male pelvic floor muscles support the bladder and bowel and affect sexual function 
To do pelvic floor muscle exercises, imagine that you re trying to stop your urine flow 
Work up to holding the contractions for seconds at a time 
Aim for at least three sets of repetitions each day 
These medications can calm an overactive bladder and may be helpful for urge incontinence 
Examples include tamsulosin Flomax , alfuzosin Uroxatral , silodosin Rapaflo , and doxazosin Cardura 
The insert acts as a plug to prevent leakage and is removed before urination 
Pessary, a flexible silicone ring that you insert into your vagina and wear all day 
The device is also used in women with vaginal prolapse 
The pessary helps support the urethra, to prevent urine leakage 
A synthetic material is injected into tissue surrounding the urethra 
The bulking material helps keep the urethra closed and reduce urine leakage 
Botox is generally prescribed to people only if other treatments haven t been successful 
The other type is a removable plug that is inserted into the vagina 
The sling helps keep the urethra closed, especially when you cough or sneeze 
It involves an abdominal incision, so it s done during general or spinal anesthesia 
Repair of pelvic organ prolapse alone does not routinely improve urinary incontinence symptoms 
You ll be instructed on how to clean these catheters for safe reuse 
If you have urge incontinence or nighttime incontinence, make the toilet more convenient 
Use a night light to illuminate your path and reduce your risk of falling 
Early studies have shown that acupuncture can provide some benefit 
Yoga also may provide some benefit for urinary incontinence, but more study is needed 
Once you do, you ll be on your way to regaining an active and confident life 
What you can doTo get ready for your appointment, it helps to 
Be aware of any pre appointment restrictions, such as restricting your diet

Parents of babies with BEEC can meet the entire care team prior to birth 
Children born with bladder exstrophy are treated with reconstructive surgery after birth 
Create outer sex organs external genitalia that look and function acceptably 
Research is ongoing to refine the surgeries and study their long term outcomes 
This procedure is called complete primary repair of bladder exstrophy 
Most surgery for newborns will include repair to the pelvic bones 
The full name of this approach is modern staged repair of bladder exstrophy 
After surgery, infants need to stay in traction while they heal 
This allows for more consistent pain control and less use of opioid medications 
After surgery, most but not all children will be able to achieve continence 
Children sometimes need to have a tube inserted into their bladders to drain urine catheterization

Your provider can diagnose cystitis based on your symptoms and medical history 
For this test, you collect a small amount of urine in a container 
Your provider checks the urine for signs of infection, such as bacteria, blood or pus 
Treatment Cystitis caused by bacterial infection is generally treated with antibiotics 
Treatment for other types of cystitis depends on what s causing it 
Treating bacterial cystitisAntibiotics are the first line of treatment for cystitis caused by bacteria 
Symptoms often improve a lot within the first few days of taking antibiotics 
Don t stop the pills early, even if you re feeling better 
This helps make sure that the infection is completely gone

Different types of antibiotics and different treatment approaches may be needed 
Women who have gone through menopause may be particularly at risk of cystitis 
As a part of treatment, your provider may give you a vaginal estrogen cream 
Treating interstitial cystitisThere s no single treatment that works best for someone with interstitial cystitis 
To relieve symptoms, you might need medication given as a pill you take by mouth 
medicine can also be placed directly into the bladder through a tube

Have you been treated for a bladder or kidney infection in the past 
Have you noticed vaginal discharge or blood in your urine 
Providers often perform another ultrasound after birth to reevaluate the kidneys 
The optical system allows the provider to see inside the urethra and bladder 
Treatment might include antibiotics to clear associated infections 
Your doctor can tell you which procedure or combination of procedures is best for you 
Drainage procedures might provide temporary or permanent relief, depending on your condition 
Surgical proceduresThere are a number of surgical procedures used to correct ureteral obstructions 
Ureteral obstruction surgery may be performed through one of these surgical approaches

Diagnosis There s no one test that can tell if you have burning mouth syndrome 
Discuss your habits and routine for keeping your teeth and mouth clean 
Test results may give clues about the source of your mouth discomfort 
A cotton swab is used to get a sample for an oral culture 
This can tell if you have a fungal, bacterial or viral infection in your mouth 
Salivary tests can tell if you have a reduced salivary flow 
These tests can tell if stomach acid flows back into your mouth from your stomach 
Don t try this on your own because it can be dangerous to stop some medicines 
Primary burning mouth syndromeThere s no known cure for primary burning mouth syndrome 
Treatment depends on what symptoms you have and is aimed at controlling them 
And it may take time for treatments to help manage symptoms 
Specific oral rinses or lidocaine, which causes numbness to help relieve pain 
Alpha lipoic acid, an antioxidant that may help relieve nerve pain 
A medicine used to control seizures called clonazepam Klonopin 
That s why it s important to try to find the cause 
Once any underlying causes are treated, your burning mouth syndrome symptoms should get better 
Avoid acidic foods and liquids, such as tomatoes, orange juice, carbonated beverages and coffee 
Avoid alcohol and products with alcohol, as they may irritate the lining of your mouth 
Coping and supportCoping with burning mouth syndrome can be challenging

The types of imaging tests recommended depend on your individual signs and symptoms 
It can also reveal whether the tumor cells are growing quickly or slowly 
Types of biopsy procedures used to diagnose bone cancer include 
Inserting a needle through your skin and into a tumor 
Your doctor uses the needle to remove small pieces of tissue from the tumor 
The number of bones affected, such as adjacent vertebrae in the spine 
Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body 
The stages of bone cancer are indicated by Roman numerals, ranging from to IV 
The lowest stages indicate that the tumor is smaller and less aggressive 
By stage IV, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body

SurgeryThe goal of surgery is to remove the entire cancerous tumor 
As other treatments have been developed, amputation is becoming less common 
ChemotherapyChemotherapy uses strong anti cancer drugs, usually delivered through a vein intravenously , to kill cancer cells 
Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high powered beams of energy, such as X rays, to kill cancer cells 
This, in turn, can help reduce the likelihood that amputation will be necessary 
With time you ll find ways to cope with the distress and uncertainty of cancer 
Learn enough about bone cancer to make decisions about your care 
Keeping your close relationships strong will help you deal with your bone cancer 
Bone cancer is often treated by a team of specialists that may include 
Orthopedic surgeons who specialize in operating on cancers that affect the bones orthopedic oncologists

Will treatment make it impossible for me to have children 
Is there one treatment that you think is best for me 
If I would like a second opinion, can you recommend a specialist 
No blood test can tell your doctor whether you do or don t have osteomyelitis 
However, damage may not be visible until osteomyelitis has been present for several weeks 
More detailed imaging tests may be necessary if your osteomyelitis has developed more recently 
CT scans are usually done only if someone can t have an MRI 
Bone biopsyA bone biopsy can reveal what type of germ has infected your bone 
An open biopsy requires anesthesia and surgery to access the bone 
This procedure requires local anesthetics to numb the area where the needle is inserted 
X ray or other imaging scans may be used for guidance 
Surrounding tissue that shows signs of infection also may be removed 
The graft helps your body repair damaged blood vessels and form new bone 
The antibiotics are usually administered through a vein in your arm for about six weeks 
An additional course of oral antibiotics may be needed for more serious infections 
For osteomyelitis, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
How long will it take for me to get better 
Have you had any cuts, scrapes or other injuries lately 
Or have you had surgical correction of a broken bone 
X rays or other imaging tests may be done to view your joints and bones

Have you ever thought of or tried to harm yourself or attempt suicide 
Do you use alcohol or recreational drugs or misuse prescription drugs 
How would you describe your childhood, including your relationship with your parents or caregivers 
Were you physically or sexually abused, or neglected, as a child 
If yes, what diagnoses were made, and what treatments were most effective 
To diagnose botulism, your health care provider checks you for muscle weakness or paralysis 
Your provider looks for symptoms such as drooping eyelids and a weak voice 
Your provider asks about foods you ve eaten in the past few days 
They try to find out if you were exposed to any bacteria through a wound 
So the provider s exam is the main way to diagnose botulism 
But recovery may take months and typically involves extended rehabilitation therapy 
A different type of antitoxin, known as botulism immune globulin, is used to treat infants 
Preparing for your appointmentYou may start by seeing your primary care health care provider 
Or you may be referred immediately to the hospital for treatment 
What you can doWhen you make the appointment, make a list of 
All medications, vitamins, or other supplements you take, including the doses 
For botulism, some basic questions to ask your provider include 
Have you or your child eaten any home canned food recently 
If your infant is ill, has your infant eaten honey 
Did anyone else eat the food suspected of making you ill 
A probe may be used to examine this area for nerve damage 
Usually, this touching causes the anal sphincter to contract and the anus to pucker 
Medical testsA number of tests are available to help pinpoint the cause of fecal incontinence 
During the exam, your provider may ask you to bear down 
A small balloon is inserted into the rectum and filled with water 
You ll then be asked to go to the toilet to expel the balloon 
A narrow, flexible tube is inserted into the anus and rectum 
A small balloon at the tip of the tube may be expanded 
A narrow, wand like instrument is inserted into the anus and rectum 
The test measures how much stool the rectum can hold 
A flexible tube is inserted into the rectum to inspect the entire colon 
Treatment MedicationsDepending on the cause of fecal incontinence, options include 
Anti diarrheal drugs such as loperamide Imodium A D and those containing diphenoxylate and atropine Lomotil 
These treatments can improve anal sphincter control and the awareness of the urge to defecate 
These muscles support the bladder and bowel and in women, the uterus 
Hold the contraction for three seconds, then relax for three seconds 
Gradually work your way up to three sets of contractions every day 
Specially trained physical therapists teach simple exercises that can increase anal muscle strength 
Contract the muscles if having a bowel movement at a certain time is inconvenient 
Sometimes the training is done with the help of anal manometry and a rectal balloon 
Establishing when you need to use the toilet can help you gain greater control 
Injections of nonabsorbable bulking agents can thicken the walls of the anus 
The sacral nerves run from your spinal cord to muscles in the pelvis 
They regulate the sensation and strength of your rectal and anal sphincter muscles 
This minimally invasive treatment stimulates the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle 
Radiofrequency therapy is minimally invasive and is generally performed under local anesthesia and sedation 
This procedure repairs a damaged or weakened anal sphincter that occurred during childbirth 
Doctors identify an injured area of muscle and free its edges from the surrounding tissue 
They then bring the muscle edges back together and sew them in an overlapping fashion 
Sphincteroplasty may be an option for people trying to avoid colostomy 
Surgical correction of these problems will likely reduce or eliminate fecal incontinence 
This surgery diverts stool through an opening in the abdomen 
Doctors attach a special bag to this opening to collect the stool 
Colostomy is generally considered only after other treatments haven t been successful 
What you eat and drink affects the consistency of your stools 
Make a list of what you eat for a few days 
You may discover a connection between certain foods and your bouts of incontinence 
Once you ve identified problem foods, stop eating them and see if your incontinence improves 
Foods can cause diarrhea or gas and worsen fecal incontinence 
Common culprits include spicy foods, fatty and greasy foods, and dairy products 
If constipation is causing fecal incontinence, your doctor may recommend eating fiber rich foods 
Fiber is predominately present in fruits, vegetables, and whole grain breads and cereals 
Aim for grams ounces of fiber a day or more 
But don t add it to your diet all at once 
Too much fiber suddenly can cause uncomfortable bloating and gas 
To relieve anal discomfort and eliminate any possible odor associated with fecal incontinence 
Gently wash the area with water after each bowel movement 
Moisture barrier creams help keep irritated skin from having direct contact with feces 
Be sure the area is clean and dry before you apply any cream 
Nonmedicated talcum powder or cornstarch also may help relieve anal discomfort 
Coping and supportFor some people, including children, fecal incontinence is a relatively minor problem 
For others, the condition can be devastating due to a complete lack of bowel control 
If you expect you ll be incontinent, wear a pad or a disposable undergarment 
Carry supplies for cleaning up and a change of clothing with you 
Use nonprescription pills to reduce the smell of stool and gas 
Because fecal incontinence can be distressing, it s important to take steps to deal with it 
Treatment can help improve your quality of life and raise your self esteem 
Preparing for your appointmentYou may start by seeing your primary health care provider 
Make a list of questions to ask during the appointment 
Will treatment for fecal incontinence complicate my care for these conditions 
Have your symptoms been continuous or do they come and go 
Do you have other conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis or chronic constipation 
Have you ever been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis or Crohn s disease 
Have you ever had radiation therapy to your pelvic area 
Were forceps used or did you have an episiotomy during childbirth 
During an EMG, your provider inserts a needle electrode through the skin into various muscles 
This provides Information about how well the nerve is functioning 
New methods of high resolution MRI, known as magnetic resonance neurography, may be used 
Computerized tomography uses a series of X rays to obtain cross sectional images of the body 
This test is sometimes performed when MRIs don t provide adequate Information 
Nerves that have only been stretched may recover without further treatment 
Surgery to repair brachial plexus nerves should generally occur within six months after the injury 
Surgeries that occur later than that have lower success rates 
During the recovery period, you must keep your joints flexible with a program of exercises 
Splints may be used to keep the hand from curling inward 
They may also be used when surgeons are trying to speed up muscle recovery 
The most commonly used donor muscle is in the inner thigh 
A section of skin and tissue attached to the donor muscle may also be removed 
This procedure consists of freeing up the nerve from scar tissue 
This provides a bridge for new nerve growth over time 
Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you forgot or missed 
Other suggestions for getting the most from your appointment include 
Children and adults with brachial plexus injuries have several options for restoring lost function 
He or she may ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history 
TestsAn electrocardiogram ECG or EKG is the main test used to diagnose bradycardia 
It s worn longer than a Holter monitor, typically days 
An ECG may be done with other tests to understand how bradycardia affects you 
A tilt test is done to see if a change in position causes fainting 
More Information Bradycardia care at Electrocardiogram ECG or EKG Holter monitorStress testTilt table testShow more related Information 
If you don t have symptoms, treatment might not be necessary 
Bradycardia treatment may include lifestyle changes, medication changes or an implanted device called a pacemaker

Your symptoms, including those that seem unrelated to your heart, and when they began 
Important personal Information, including major stresses or recent life changes and your medical history 
Medications, including vitamins and other supplements you take, including doses 
For bradycardia, basic questions to ask your health care provider include 
How will other conditions I have or medications I take affect my heart problem 
One or more tests may be used to diagnose brain AVM 
Radiologists trained in brain and nervous system imaging neuroradiologists usually conduct imaging tests 
MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain 
The radiation is most powerful where all the beams intersect 
The surgeon then reattaches the skull bone and closes the incision in the scalp 
AVMs that are in deep brain regions carry a higher risk of complications 
In these cases, your health care provider may recommend other treatments 
The catheter is positioned in one of the arteries that feeds the brain AVM 
But it is frequently used prior to other surgical treatments to make them safer 
This treatment uses precisely focused radiation to destroy the AVM 
It isn t surgery in the literal sense because there are no cuts into the body 
More Information Brain AVM arteriovenous malformation care at Computer assisted brain surgeryStereotactic radiosurgery 
Learn about brain AVM to make informed decisions about your care 
Keeping your close relationships strong will help you during your recovery 
It may also be detected after other symptoms prompt a brain scan 
Also avoid taking any blood thinning medications, such as warfarin Jantovin 
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is commonly used to help diagnose brain metastases 
A dye may be injected through a vein in your arm during your MRI study 
Other imaging tests may include computerized tomography CT and positron emission tomography PET 
More Information Brain metastases care at CT scanMRIPositron emission tomography scanShow more related Information 
In certain situations, your treatment team may consider drug treatments for brain metastases 
Even removing a portion of the tumor may help reduce your signs and symptoms 
Surgery to remove brain metastases carries risks, such as neurologic deficits, infection and bleeding 
Other risks may depend on the part of your brain where your tumors are located 
During stereotactic radiation therapy, many beams of radiation are aimed at the tumor cells 
Radiation therapy uses high energy beams, such as X rays and protons, to kill tumor cells 
Whole brain radiation applies radiation to the entire brain in order to kill tumor cells 
People undergoing whole brain radiation usually require to treatments over two to three weeks 
Side effects may include nausea, headache, seizures, and dizziness or vertigo 
MedicationsIn certain situations your treatment team might recommend medications to control your brain metastases 
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill quickly growing cells in the body, including cancer cells 
Your doctor may refer you to services that can help 
Physical therapy can help you regain lost motor skills or muscle strength 
Sign up for free and receive the latest on brain tumor treatment, diagnosis and surgery 
Try stress reduction techniques such as muscle relaxation, visualization and meditation 
Coping with brain metastasis requires more than enduring your symptoms 
Cancer that has spread can be very difficult to cure 
Each person finds his or her own way to cope with a cancer diagnosis 
Until you find what works best for you, consider trying to 
Find out enough about brain metastasis to make decisions about your care 
Ask your doctor about the details of your cancer and your treatment options 
List all medications, vitamins or supplements that you re taking, including doses 
For brain metastases, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
What experimental treatments or clinical trials are available to me 
This contrast enhanced MRI scan of a person s head shows a meningioma 
This meningioma has grown large enough to push down into the brain tissue 
A neurological exam tests different parts of your brain to see how they re working 
This exam may include checking your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes 
A computed tomography scan, also called a CT scan, uses X rays to make pictures 
A CT scan can detect problems in and around your brain 
The results give your health care provider clues to decide what test to do next 
Often a dye is injected into a vein in the arm before an MRI 
Sometimes you need a special type of MRI to create more detailed pictures 
This helps your health care provider plan surgery and other treatments 
This test uses MRI to measure levels of certain chemicals in the tumor cells 
Your health care team uses this Information to plan your treatment 
A positron emission tomography scan, also called a PET scan, can detect some brain tumors 
A PET scan uses a radioactive tracer that s injected into a vein 
The tracer travels through the blood and attaches to brain tumor cells 
Cells that are dividing and multiplying quickly will take up more of the tracer 
A PET scan may be most helpful for detecting brain tumors that are growing quickly 
Brain tumors that grow slowly might not be detected on a PET scan 
Not everyone with a brain tumor needs a PET scan 
Ask your health care provider whether you need at PET scan 
Often a surgeon gets the sample during surgery to remove the brain tumor 
If surgery isn t possible, a sample might be removed with a needle 
During this procedure, a small hole is drilled in the skull 
Risks include bleeding in the brain and damage to the brain tissue 
The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing 
Tests can see whether the cells are cancerous or not cancerous 
Other tests can find out what DNA changes are present in the cells 
This helps your health care team create your treatment plan 
The grade tells your health care team how quickly the cells are growing and multiplying 
The grade is based on how the cells look under a microscope 
The cells aren t very different from the healthy cells nearby 
Brain tumors and brain cancers aren t likely to spread, so they don t have stages 
The prognosis is how likely it is that the brain tumor can be cured 
Things that can influence the prognosis for people with brain tumors include 
Which DNA changes are present in the brain tumor cells 
Whether the brain tumor can be removed completely with surgery 
More Information Brain tumor care at CT scanMRINeedle biopsyPositron emission tomography scanShow more related Information 
Options might include surgery, radiation therapy, radiosurgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy 
Brain tumor removal surgery can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors 
Some brain tumors are small and easy to separate from surrounding brain tissue 
This makes it likely that the tumor will be removed completely 
Sometimes a brain tumor is near an important part of the brain 
The surgeon might take out as much of the tumor as is safe 
Removing only part of a brain tumor is sometimes called a subtotal resection 
Removal of part of your brain tumor may help reduce your symptoms 
There are many ways of doing a brain tumor removal surgery 
Which option is best for you depends on your situation 
Removing part of the skull to get to the brain tumor 
Brain surgery that involves removing part of the skull is called craniotomy 
It s the way most brain tumor removal operations are done 
Craniotomy is used for treating cancerous brain tumors and benign brain tumors 
The skin and muscles are moved out of the way 
Then the surgeon uses a drill to cut out a section of skull bone 
The bone is removed to get access to the brain 
You re also given medicine that puts you in a sleep like state during surgery 
This helps lower the risk of hurting important parts of the brain 
Using a long, thin tube to get to the brain tumor 
Endoscopic brain surgery involves putting a long, thin tube into the brain 
Special tools are put through the tube to remove the tumor 
Endoscopic brain surgery is often used to treat pituitary tumors 
The long, thin tube is put through the nose and sinuses and into the brain 
The surgeon might use a drill to make a hole in the skull 
The long, thin tube is carefully put through the brain tissue 
Surgery to remove a brain tumor has a risk of side effects and complications 
These can include infection, bleeding, blood clots and injury to the brain tissue 
Other risks may depend on the part of the brain where the tumor is located 
Surgery to remove a tumor on a nerve that controls hearing could cause hearing loss 
Radiation therapyRadiation therapy for brain tumors uses powerful energy beams to kill tumor cells 
The energy can come from X rays, protons and other sources 
Radiation therapy for brain tumors usually comes from a machine outside the body 
Radiation therapy can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors 
External beam radiation therapy is usually done in short daily treatments 
If there are many tumors, the entire brain might need radiation treatment 
When all of the brain is treated, it s called whole brain radiation 
The proton beams can be more carefully targeted to only hurt the tumor cells 
They may be less likely to hurt nearby healthy tissue 
Proton therapy may be helpful for treating brain tumors in children 
Proton therapy isn t as widely available as traditional X ray radiation therapy 
Sometimes radiation therapy side effects show up many years later 
These late side effects might include memory and thinking problems 
Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumors is an intense form of radiation treatment 
It aims beams of radiation from many angles at the brain tumor 
Radiosurgery can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors 
LINAC machines are known by their brand names, such as CyberKnife, TrueBeam and others 
A Gamma Knife machine aims many small beams of radiation at the same time 
It s becoming more common but isn t available at all hospitals 
Radiosurgery is typically done in one treatment or a few treatments 
You can go home after treatment and don t need to stay in a hospital 
Side effects of radiosurgery include feeling very tired and skin changes on your scalp 
The skin on your head may feel dry, itchy and sensitive 
You might have blisters on the skin or hair loss 
ChemotherapyChemotherapy for brain tumors uses strong medicines to kill tumor cells 
Chemotherapy medicines can be taken in pill form or injected into a vein 
Sometimes the chemotherapy medicine is placed in the brain tissue during surgery 
Chemotherapy can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors 
Sometimes it s done at the same time as radiation therapy 
Chemotherapy side effects depend on the type and dose of drugs you receive 
By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause tumor cells to die 
Targeted therapy medicines are available for certain types of brain cancers and benign brain tumors 
You could need help with moving, speaking, seeing and thinking 
Based on your specific needs, your health care provider might suggest 
Physical therapy to help you regain lost motor skills or muscle strength 
Occupational therapy to help you get back to your typical daily activities, including work 
Tutoring for school age children to help them cope with changes in their memory and thinking 
Alternative medicine Little research has been done on complementary and alternative brain tumor treatments 
No alternative treatments have been proved to cure brain tumors 
However, complementary treatments may help you cope with the stress of a brain tumor diagnosis 
Coping and supportSome people say a brain tumor diagnosis feels overwhelming and frightening 
It might make you feel like you have little control over your health 
It might help to take steps to understand your condition and talk about your feelings 
Learn enough about brain tumors to make decisions about your care 
Ask your health care provider about your specific type of brain tumor 
Ask about your treatment options and, if you like, your prognosis 
As you learn more about brain tumors, you may feel better about making treatment decisions 
Keeping your close relationships strong will help you deal with your brain tumor 
This may be a friend, family member or clergy member 
Ask your health care team about brain tumor support groups in your area 
If you re diagnosed with a brain tumor, you may be referred to specialists 
Doctors who use medicine to treat cancer, called medical oncologists 
Doctors who use radiation to treat cancer, called radiation oncologists 
Surgeons who operate on the brain and nervous system, called neurosurgeons

It can help the healthcare team decide which tests are needed next 
Tests and procedures used to diagnose pediatric brain tumors include 
Neurological examA neurological exam tests different parts of the brain to see how they re working 
During the exam, a healthcare professional might check your child s 
The most common imaging test for brain tumors is magnetic resonance imaging, also called MRI 
Sometimes a special type of MRI is needed to get more detailed pictures 
Special types of MRI include functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
If surgery isn t possible, the tissue sample might be removed with a needle 
During this procedure, a surgeon drills a small hole in the skull 
Your child s healthcare team uses the results from these tests to create a treatment plan 
Lumbar punctureA lumbar puncture is a procedure to collect fluid from around the spinal cord 
A lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, is done using a needle 
The fluid goes to a lab where it s tested for cancer cells 
When it does, it tends to go to the cerebrospinal fluid 
Treatment Treatment for pediatric brain tumors depends on many factors 
Your child s healthcare team considers the type, size and location of the tumor 
The care team also considers your child s age and overall health 
Treatment options might include surgery, radiation therapy, radiosurgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy 
Sometimes the brain tumor is in a spot that s hard to reach 
Sometimes it is near important parts of the brain that could be hurt during surgery 
Surgery to remove a pediatric brain tumor carries risks, such as infection and bleeding 
During radiation therapy, your child lies on a table in the treatment room 
A machine moves around the child and aims radiation at precise points 
Radiation treatments require keeping very still so that the machine targets the exact area 
Some medical centers offer different types of energy sources for radiation therapy, such as 
Radiation that comes from X rays is the most common type of radiation therapy 
Proton beams can be more carefully targeted to the tumor cells 
Proton therapy may be less likely to hurt healthy tissue near the brain tumor 
Children may benefit from this type of radiation because their brains are still developing 
Common side effects include feeling very tired, scalp irritation, temporary hair loss and headaches 
RadiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumors is an intense form of radiation treatment 
Different types of energy can be used during radiosurgery treatment 
Which type is best for your child will depend on your child s situation 
Side effects of radiosurgery include feeling very tired and skin changes on the scalp 
The skin on your child s head may feel dry, itchy and sensitive 
Some children have blisters on the skin or hair loss 
Chemotherapy side effects depend on the medicines your child receives 
General side effects of chemotherapy include nausea, vomiting and temporary hair loss 
Targeted therapy medicines are available for certain types of brain tumors in children 
These studies provide a chance to try the latest treatments 
For children with brain tumors, palliative care can help relieve pain and other symptoms 
The team can include doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals 
The goal is to improve the quality of life for your child and your family

Recovering after treatmentChildren may need support after treatment to help them recover 
Physical therapy to help your child regain lost motor skills or muscle strength 
Occupational therapy to help your child get back to daily activities 
Alternative medicine Little research has been done on alternative treatments for pediatric brain tumors 
It s an approach that healthcare professionals sometimes call integrative medicine 
Your healthcare team will work with your family to make sure your child is comfortable 
Combining integrative treatments with standard treatments may offer some extra comfort 
At the hospitalWhen your child has medical appointments or stays in the hospital 
Stay with your child during a test or treatment, if possible 
Use words that your child will understand to describe what will happen 
Healthcare team members may offer activities to support your child while going through treatment 
Ask to speak with a social worker or child life specialist 
If your child feels well enough, gently encourage participation in regular activities 
Keep a daily record of your child s condition at home 
Make note of your child s body temperature, energy level and sleeping patterns 
Stick to your child s usual diet unless your healthcare team suggests otherwise 
Check with the healthcare team before any vaccinations because cancer treatment affects the immune system 
Be prepared to talk with your other children about the brain tumor 
Here s some Information to help you and your child get ready for the appointment 
What you can doBefore your child s appointment, make a list of 
Symptoms, including any that seem not related to the reason for the appointment 
Key personal Information, including any major stresses or recent changes in your child s life 
Questions to ask your child s healthcare team to make the most of your time 
For a pediatric brain tumor, some basic questions to ask include 
During a mammogram, you stand in front of an X ray machine designed for mammography 
Getting a breast MRI involves lying face down on a padded scanning table 
The breasts fit into a hollow space in the table 
The hollow has coils that get signals from the MRI 
The table slides into the large opening of the MRI machine 
A core needle biopsy uses a long, hollow tube to obtain a sample of tissue 
Here, a biopsy of a suspicious breast lump is being done 
The sample is sent to a lab for testing and evaluation by doctors, called pathologists 
Breast cancer diagnosis often begins with an exam and a discussion of your symptoms 
Imaging tests can look at the breast tissue for anything that s not typical 
This might include changes in the skin or to the nipple 
The health professional also feels along the collarbones and around the armpits for lumps 
Breast ultrasoundUltrasound uses sound waves to make pictures of structures inside the body 
A breast ultrasound may give your healthcare team more Information about a breast lump 
The healthcare team uses this Information to decide what tests you might need next 
A breast MRI can make more detailed pictures of the breast 
It also might be used to look for cancer in the other breast 
Before a breast MRI, you usually receive an injection of dye 
The dye helps the tissue show up better in the images 
Often, a marker is placed in the spot where the tissue sample was removed 
The small metal marker will show up on imaging tests 
The marker helps your healthcare team monitor the area of concern 
Tests can show whether the cells in the sample are cancerous 
Other tests give Information about the type of cancer and how quickly it s growing 
For example, tests might look for hormone receptors on the surface of the cells 
Your healthcare team uses the results from these tests to make a treatment plan 
Your healthcare team uses your cancer s stage to understand your prognosis 
Tests and procedures used to stage breast cancer may include 
Your healthcare team picks the right tests based on your specific situation 
A lower number means the cancer is less advanced and more likely to be cured 
breast cancer is cancer that is contained within a breast duct 
It hasn t broken out to invade the breast tissue yet 
Treatment Breast cancer treatment often starts with surgery to remove the cancer 
Some people may have chemotherapy or hormone therapy before surgery 
These medicines can help shrink the cancer and make it easier to remove 
Your treatment plan will depend on your particular breast cancer 
Your care team also considers your overall health and what you prefer 
Consider seeking a second opinion from a breast specialist in a breast center or clinic 
Talk to breast cancer survivors who have faced the same decision 
A lumpectomy involves removing the cancer and some of the healthy tissue that surrounds it 
During a total mastectomy, the surgeon removes the breast tissue, nipple, areola and skin 
Sentinel node biopsy identifies the first few lymph nodes into which a tumor drains 
The nodes are removed and tested for signs of cancer 
Other names for this surgery are breast conserving surgery and wide local excision 
Most people who have a lumpectomy also have radiation therapy 
A mastectomy is surgery to remove all breast tissue from a breast 
The most common mastectomy procedure is total mastectomy, also called simple mastectomy 
It also might be needed when there are multiple areas of cancer within one breast 
Some newer types of mastectomy procedures might not remove the skin or nipple 
A nipple sparing mastectomy leaves the nipple and the skin around it, called the areola 
A sentinel node biopsy is an operation to take out some lymph nodes for testing 
When breast cancer spreads, it often goes to the nearby lymph nodes first 
Axillary lymph node dissection is an operation to remove many lymph nodes from the armpit 
It also might be used if cancer is found in a sentinel node biopsy 
Complications of breast cancer surgery depend on the procedures you choose 
All operations have a risk of pain, bleeding and infection 
Removing lymph nodes in the armpit carries a risk of arm swelling, called lymphedema 
You may choose to have breast reconstruction after mastectomy surgery 
Breast reconstruction is surgery to restore shape to the breast 
Options might include reconstruction with a breast implant or reconstruction using your own tissue 
External beam radiation uses high powered beams of energy to kill cancer cells 
For breast cancer treatment, the radiation is often external beam radiation 
The machine directs radiation to precise points on your body 
Less often, the radiation can be placed inside the body 
It can kill any cancer cells that might be left after surgery 
The radiation lowers the risk of the cancer coming back 
Breast tissue also may look swollen or feel more firm 
Very rarely, a new cancer can grow in the treated area 
ChemotherapyChemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines Many chemotherapy medicines exist 
The chemotherapy might shrink the breast cancer so that it s easier to remove 
Chemotherapy before surgery also might control cancer that spreads to the lymph nodes 
When the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, chemotherapy can help control it 
Chemotherapy may relieve symptoms of an advanced cancer, such as pain 
Rare side effects can include premature menopause and nerve damage 
Very rarely, certain chemotherapy medicines can cause blood cell cancer 
Hormone therapyHormone therapy uses medicines to block certain hormones in the body 
It s a treatment for breast cancers that are sensitive to the hormones estrogen and progesterone 
Healthcare professionals call these cancers estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive 
Cancers that are sensitive to hormones use the hormones as fuel for their growth 
Blocking the hormones can cause the cancer cells to shrink or die 
Hormone therapy is often used after surgery and other treatments 
It can lower the risk that the cancer will come back 
Treatment s that can be used in hormone therapy include 
medicines that stop the body from making estrogen after menopause 
Surgery or medicines to stop the ovaries from making hormones 
Hormone therapy side effects depend on the treatment you receive 
The side effects can include hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness 
More serious side effects include a risk of bone thinning and blood clots 
Targeted therapyTargeted therapy uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells 
The most common targeted therapy medicines for breast cancer target the protein HER 
Many other targeted therapy medicines exist for treating breast cancer 
Your cancer cells may be tested to see whether these medicines might help you 
Some are used after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back 
Others are used only when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body 
Immunotherapy might be an option for treating triple negative breast cancer 
Their goal is to improve quality of life for you and your family 
This feeling of being very tired and worn down can continue for years 
Find an activity that allows you to write about or discuss your emotions 
Try stress reduction techniques such as muscle relaxation, visualization, and spending time with friends and family 
Coping and supportSome breast cancer survivors say their diagnosis felt overwhelming at first 
In time, you ll find ways to cope with your feelings 
Until you find what works for you, it might help to 
Still, some people don t want to know the details of their cancer 
If this is how you feel, let your care team know that too 
In the United States, you might start with the American Cancer Society 
Examples include listening when you want to talk or helping you with preparing meals 
Doctors who specialize in diagnostic tests, such as mammograms, called radiologists 
Keep all of your records that relate to your cancer diagnosis and treatment 
Organize your records in a binder or folder that you can take to your appointments 
Questions to ask your doctorYour time with your healthcare professional is limited 
How do you know that these treatments will benefit me 
How quickly do I need to make a decision about cancer treatment 
Does my insurance plan cover the tests and treatment you re recommending 
Are there any clinical trials or newer treatments that I should consider 
Other tests include imaging tests and removing some cells for testing 
Tests and procedures used to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer include 
Additional imaging tests, such as an MRI, may be recommended in certain situations 
This type of biopsy removes a sample of skin cells 
Your healthcare team uses the cancer staging test results to help create your treatment plan 
Talk with your healthcare professional about which tests are best for you 
The stages of breast cancer range from to 
The lower numbers mean the cancer is small and hasn t spread from where it started 
You may receive chemotherapy medicines through a vein, in pill form or both 
This pre surgical treatment, called neoadjuvant therapy, aims to shrink the cancer before surgery 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases the chance that surgery will be successful 
Additional chemotherapy decreases the chance that the cancer will recur 
This includes the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue and some skin, including the nipple and areola 
Surgery to remove the nearby lymph nodes, called axillary dissection 
The surgeon removes the lymph nodes under the arm and near the affected breast 
Talk with your healthcare team about your options for breast reconstruction 
During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around you 
The radiation is aimed at your chest, armpit and shoulder 
This protein is called human epidermal growth factor receptor , also called HER 
After surgery, targeted therapy can be combined with hormone therapy 
If the cancer has already spread, hormone therapy may shrink and control it 
medicines that block hormones from attaching to cancer cells, called selective estrogen receptor modulators 
medicines that stop the body from making estrogen after menopause, called aromatase inhibitors 
Surgery or medicines that stop the ovaries from making hormones 
This can include doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals 
Their goal is to improve the quality of life for you and your family 
For inflammatory breast cancer, some basic questions to ask include 
Is there one treatment you believe is best for me 
If you had a friend or family member in my situation, what would you recommend 
How much time can I take to choose a treatment 
Diagnosis Diagnosing male breast cancerTests and procedures to diagnose male breast cancer might include 
Imaging tests can create pictures of breast tissue to look for signs of cancer 
Tests may include a breast X ray, called a mammogram, an ultrasound or an MRI scan 
Removing a sample of breast cells for testing, called a biopsy 
The health professional guides the needle using a mammogram or another imaging test 
In the lab, specialists examine the cells under a microscope to see if they re cancer 
Other tests can tell whether your cancer cells have hormone receptors or certain DNA changes 
The test results help your health care team create a treatment plan 
There might be other tests and procedures depending on your situation 
Results from lab tests on the cancer cells also help determine the cancer s stage 
This tells your health care team how quickly the cancer is growing 
Your care team also considers whether your cancer cells have receptors 
Tests can look for receptors for estrogen, progesterone and HER 
Results from these tests are used to assign your cancer a stage 
At this stage, the cancer is inside the milk ducts 
As the cancer grows and invades the breast tissue, the stages get higher 
Stage breast cancer means the cancer has spread to other areas of the body

Treatment Male breast cancer treatment usually starts with surgery 
Other common treatments include chemotherapy, hormone therapy and radiation therapy 
A mastectomy involves removing all the breast tissue from one side of your chest 
This includes removing the nipple and the skin around it, called the areola 
This is the most common type of surgery for male breast cancer 
A lumpectomy involves removing the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it 
Removing a few lymph nodes for testing, called a sentinel lymph node biopsy 
Those few lymph nodes, called sentinel nodes, are sent to a lab for testing 
If cancer is found, more lymph nodes are removed for testing 
Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill cancer cells 
The radiation is often aimed at the chest and armpit 
If your cancer is hormone sensitive, hormone therapy might be an option 
Hormone therapy can keep cancer from coming back after surgery 
Hormone therapy for male breast cancer often involves the medicine tamoxifen 
Other hormone therapy medicines might be an option if you can t take tamoxifen 
You may feel comfortable discussing your feelings with a friend or family member 
Or you might prefer meeting with a formal support group 
Support groups for the families of cancer survivors also are available 
Or you can have a spiritual adviser or an instructor guide you 
Gentle exercise may help boost your mood and make you feel better 
Ask a member of your health care team about exercises you can do 
Certain activities, such as art, dance and music, may help you feel less distressed 
Some cancer centers have specially trained professionals who can guide you through these activities 
Relaxation exercises help refocus your mind and help you relax 
You can do relaxation exercises on your own or with an instructor 
You might be referred to a doctor who specializes in treating cancer, called an oncologist 
Is there a treatment option you feel is best for me 
Be sure to ask all the questions you have about male breast cancer 
What to expect from your doctorBe ready to answer questions such as 
Are your symptoms ongoing or do they come and go 
If so, what type of cancer and at what age were the family members diagnosed 
This is usually either an imaging test or fine needle aspiration 
Large cysts and clusters of small cysts can usually be seen with mammography 
But microcysts can be difficult or impossible to see on a mammogram 
Your doctor may recommend a biopsy to further evaluate a mass that appears solid 
Often, fine needle aspiration is done using ultrasound to guide accurate placement of the needle 
A sample of the tissue may be collected to check for cancer 
For some breast cysts, however, you may need to have fluid drained more than once 
Discontinuing hormone therapy after menopause may also help prevent breast cysts 
SurgerySurgery to remove a breast cyst is necessary only in unusual circumstances 
Lifestyle and home remediesTo minimize discomfort associated with breast cysts, you might try these measures 
Supporting your breasts with a bra that fits well may help relieve some discomfort 
Either a warm compress or an ice pack can help relieve pain 
Studies haven t shown a link between caffeine and breast cysts 
However, some women find symptom relief after eliminating caffeine from their diets 
Consider trying over the counter pain medications if your doctor recommends them 
What you can doThe first evaluation focuses on your medical history 
You ll discuss your symptoms, their relation to your menstrual cycle and any other relevant Information 
Key personal Information, including major stresses or recent life changes 
All medications, vitamins, herbal remedies and supplements that you regularly take 
Are there any printed materials that I can take home 
When did you first notice the breast cyst or lump 
Have you noticed a change in the size of the breast cyst or lump 
What symptoms have you experienced, and how long have you had them 
If so, does it occur in one or both breasts 
How does your menstrual cycle affect the breast cyst or lump 
Do you have a family history of breast cysts or lumps 
Have you previously had a breast cyst or lump, a breast biopsy or breast cancer 
Your doctor may recommend a mammogram or ultrasound or both 
If you have an infection, a day course of antibiotics is usually needed 
It s important to take all of the medication to minimize your chance of recurrence 
If your mastitis doesn t clear up after taking antibiotics, follow up with your doctor 
Weaning your baby abruptly is likely to worsen your signs and symptoms 
Your doctor might refer you to a lactation consultant for help and ongoing support 
Suggestions for adjusting your breast feeding techniques might include the following 
Avoiding prolonged overfilling of your breast with milk before breast feeding 
Expressing a small amount of milk by hand before breast feeding might help 
Massaging the breast while breast feeding or pumping, from the affected area down toward the nipple 
Breast feeding on the affected side first, when your infant is hungrier and sucking more strongly 
Bring your baby across the front of your body, tummy to tummy 
Support the back of the baby s head with your open hand 
With the other hand, support your breast from the underside in a U shaped hold 
As with the cross cradle hold, sit up straight preferably in a chair with armrests 
It might help to support your breast in a C shaped hold with your other hand 
With the other hand, grasp your breast and touch your nipple to your baby s lips 
If you have twins, you might choose to breast feed them separately 
This can be helpful when you are first starting to breast feed 
Hold each baby at one side, with your elbows bent 
For comfort, put pillows on your lap and use a chair with broad, low arms 
Avoid prolonged overfilling of your breast with milk before breast feeding 
Apply cool compresses or ice packs to your breast after breast feeding 
Preparing for your appointmentYou may be referred to an obstetrician gynecologist 
For problems related to breast feeding, you may be referred to a lactation consultant

For many people, breast pain resolves on its own over time 
This may involve a simple adjustment, such as wearing a bra with extra support 
You may need to use NSAIDs when your pain is intense 
You might consider lowering the dose of menopausal hormone therapy or stopping it entirely 
Take note of all your symptoms, even if they seem unrelated to your breast pain 
Review key personal Information, including major stresses or recent life changes 
List all the medications, vitamins and supplements that you regularly take 
List questions to ask your doctor, from most important to least important 
For breast pain, basic questions to ask your doctor include 
What to expect from your doctorYour doctor may ask you questions such as 
Does the pain seem to occur in any sort of pattern 
Have you noticed any skin changes, such as redness or a rash 
Does your pain make you less able to perform daily activities 
People who have a broken collarbone usually need to wear a sling 
What you can doIt might be helpful to write a list that includes 
Details about symptoms, what caused the injury and when it happened 
All medicines, vitamins and dietary supplements you take, including doses 
Moving your foot around can show your range of motion 
Your health professional might want to watch how you walk 
Stress fractures often don t show up on X rays until the break starts healing 
A bone scan can find breaks that don t show up on X rays 
A technician injects a small amount of radioactive material into a vein 
Most often, a broken bone must be kept from moving so that it can heal 
What you can doYou may want to write a list that includes 
All the medicines, vitamins and supplements you take, including doses 
If I need a cast, how long will I need to wear it 
What to expect from your doctorYour healthcare professional may ask questions, including 
Have you recently begun an exercise program or started exercising more or harder 
Keep your foot and ankle raised above the level of your heart to limit swelling 
Lightly wrap the injury in a soft bandage that provides slight pressure 
Occasionally, computerized tomography CT or magnetic resonance imaging MRI is needed for more detailed images 
In this type of fracture, the skin is pierced by the broken bone 
This term means that the bone is cracked but not separated into two parts 
In complete fractures, the bone has broken into two or more parts 
A displaced fracture may require surgery to realign the bones properly 
Here, health care providers typically evaluate the injury and immobilize the leg with a splint 
Some fractures are splinted at first to allow swelling to subside 
A cast is then used once there is less swelling 
ImmobilizationFor a broken bone to heal properly, its movement needs to be restricted 
A splint or a cast is often used to immobilize the broken bone 
If you re experiencing severe pain, your health care provider might prescribe stronger pain medications 
Surgery and other proceduresImmobilization with a cast or splint heals most broken bones 
This type of surgery is more likely in people who have 
A fracture that is the result of a crushing accident 
Detailed descriptions of the symptoms and what caused the injury 
For a broken leg, some basic questions to ask your care provider include 
What are the alternatives to the primary treatment you re suggesting 
Have you had broken bones in the past or a history of osteoporosis 
Do you have any numbness, tingling or loss of sensation to the injured area 
One or more of the following imaging tests might help with the diagnosis 
Using low levels of radiation, X rays allow the bones to be seen 
But X rays might not show a fresh break, especially if the bone is only cracked 
X rays also can help diagnose a lung that has caved in 
CT scans also make it easier to see injuries to soft tissues and blood vessels 
This scan can look for harm to the soft tissues and organs around the ribs 
This is good for viewing cracked bones, also called stress fractures 
A bone can crack after repetitive trauma, such as long bouts of coughing 
During a bone scan, a small amount of radioactive material is injected into your bloodstream 
Treatment Most broken ribs heal on their own within six weeks 
Being less active and icing the area regularly can help with healing and pain relief 
Not being able to breathe deeply because of pain can lead to pneumonia 
TherapyOnce pain is under control, certain exercises can help you breathe more deeply 
What you can doBefore you see your primary care provider, make a list of 
How can I best manage this with my other health conditions 
What to expect from your doctorYour care provider might ask 
Are your symptoms constant or do they come and go 
Does anything you do make the pain better or worse 
Putting gauze or felt between the toes before taping can prevent skin soreness 
This can prevent the toe from moving and provide more room for swelling 
Lifestyle and home remediesRaising the foot and using ice can help reduce swelling and pain 
Prop your foot up when possible so that your injury is higher than your heart 
Does your injury feel better or worse when you move your foot certain ways 
Other imaging testsSometimes, other imaging tests can give your doctor more detail 
Injuries to soft tissues and blood vessels can be seen on CT scans 
Ask your doctor about the best ways to move them 
ImmobilizationRestricting the movement of a broken bone in your wrist is critical to proper healing 
To do this, you ll likely need a splint or a cast 
MedicationsTo reduce pain, your doctor might recommend an over the counter pain reliever 
If your pain is severe, you might need an opioid medication, such as codeine 
NSAIDs can help with pain but might also hamper bone healing, especially if used long term 
Rehabilitation can help, but it can take several months or longer for complete healing 
A fracture in which the bone pieces move before they heal 
Even after reduction and immobilization with a cast or splint, your bones can shift 
So your doctor likely will monitor your progress with X rays 
In some cases, the surgeon will immobilize your fracture by using an external fixation device 
A description of your symptoms and how, where and when the injury occurred 
For a broken wrist, questions to ask your doctor include 
Will I need physical therapy when the cast comes off 
Was your wrist bent backward or forward when the impact occurred 
Where does it hurt, and do certain movements make it hurt more or less 
Tests and X rays are not usually needed to diagnose bronchiolitis 
A chest X ray can show if there are signs of pneumonia 
This is done using a swab that s gently inserted into the nose 
Occasionally, blood tests might be used to check your child s white blood cell count 
Treatment Bronchiolitis usually lasts for to weeks but symptoms occasionally last longer 
Most children with bronchiolitis can be cared for at home with comfort measures 
It s important to be alert for problems with breathing that are getting worse 
Bacterial infections such as pneumonia or an ear infection can happen along with bronchiolitis 
Hospital careA small number of children may need a stay in the hospital 
Your child also may get fluids through a vein to prevent dehydration 
In severe cases, a tube may be guided into the windpipe to help breathing 
Your child s health care provider may add oral rehydration therapy 
They are effective, safe and won t irritate the nose, even for children 
Be careful not to push the bulb too far into the nose 
Consider pain relievers that you can buy without a prescription 
Also, consider avoiding the use of these medicines for children younger than years old 
If so, is there a generic option to the medicine you re recommending 
What can I do to make my child feel better 
What to expect from your doctorYour child s health care provider may ask questions, such as 
Does your child have symptoms all the time, or do they come and go 
What, if anything, seems to make your child s symptoms better 
What, if anything, seems to make your child s symptoms worse 
In some cases, your doctor may suggest the following tests 
This is especially important if you ever were or currently are a smoker 
Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs 
MedicationsBecause most cases of bronchitis are caused by viral infections, antibiotics aren t effective 
In some circumstances, your doctor may recommend other medications, including 
If your cough keeps you from sleeping, you might try cough suppressants at bedtime 
Warm, moist air helps relieve coughs and loosens mucus in your airways 
You might also want to bring a family member or friend to your appointment 
Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the Information provided 
Diagnosis During regular dental exams, your dentist likely will check for signs of bruxism 
To evaluate the extent of bruxism, your dentist may check for 
Other approachesOne or more of these approaches may help relieve bruxism 
Ask your dentist to show you the best position for your mouth and jaw 
Examples of medications that may be used for bruxism include 
Treating associated disordersTreatment for associated disorders may include

Let your doctor know about anything you ve taken to help you sleep 
This test is often done in a special vascular laboratory 
But it can be done at a medical provider s office 
Other tests may be done to check blood flow to the skin 
Before the images are taken, a special dye may be given by IV 
The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on the images 
A long, thin flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel 
Dye, also called contrast, flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart 
The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X ray images and video 
The only proven treatment for Buerger disease is to quit using all tobacco products 
Even one cigarette a day can make the disease worse 
Nicotine replacement products aren t an option because they still have nicotine in them 
Your health care provider can recommend other medicines that might help 
Another option is a live in program to help you stop smoking 
You typically stay at a treatment center or hospital for a few days or weeks 
You ll learn how to stop cravings for cigarettes and how to live tobacco free 
It s approved to treat high blood pressure in the lungs 
But a few studies showed that it improved blood flow in people with Buerger disease 
Other medicines depend on your symptoms and other health conditions 
medicines may be given to treat pain or heal skin sores 
Your health care provider may call this treatment intermittent pneumatic compression pumping 
This treatment puts pressure on the affected body area to improve blood flow 
During compression therapy, you wear a sleeve over the affected arm or leg 
The pump sends air into the sleeve on and off 
Check every day for cuts and scrapes on the arms and legs 
A lack of blood flow to the arms and legs increases the risk of infection 
Even small cuts and scrapes can turn into serious infections 
Always clean cuts and scrapes with soap and water to prevent infection 
Apply antibiotic ointment and cover the cuts with clean bandages 
If a skin injury gets worse or heals slowly, see a health care provider quickly 
Visit a dentist regularly to keep gums and teeth in good health 
Not smoking is the best way to prevent and manage Buerger disease 
Any amount of secondhand smoke is bad for the heart and blood vessels 
This type of health care provider is called a vascular specialist 
What you can doTake someone along to your health care provider s visit, if possible 
Your symptoms, including any that may not seem to be related to Buerger disease 
Important personal Information, such as if you ve ever smoked or used any tobacco products 
What to expect from your doctorYour health care provider might ask 
Talk to you about your eating habits, ways to lose weight and physical symptoms 
Request an ECG or other tests to look for problems with your heart 
The more often the episodes occur, the more severe the bulimia is 
When you have bulimia, you may need one or more types of treatment 
Treatment includes proven therapies and medicines that may help you get better 
Studies show that these types of talk therapy can reduce symptoms of bulimia 
This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, also known as an SSRI 
It may help with symptoms of bulimia, even if you re not depressed 
This medicine works better when it s used with talk therapy 
Nutrition educationDietitians with special training in treating eating disorders can help 
Some programs for eating disorders may offer day treatment rather than a hospital stay 
Periods of binge eating and purging may come and go through the years 
If you find yourself back in the binge eating purge cycle, get help 
Lifestyle and home remediesIn addition to professional treatment, use these self care tips 
Knowing more about your condition can help you stay with your treatment plan 
But you should try to get most of your vitamins and minerals from food 
And having people who care about you in your life is healthy for you 
Try not to weigh yourself or check yourself in the mirror a lot 
These actions may fuel your drive to keep unhealthy habits 
Remind yourself what a healthy weight is for your body 
Try not to diet or skip meals, which can cause binge eating 
Make a plan to cope with the hardships of setbacks 
Look for positive role models who can make you feel better about yourself 
Group members can understand what you re going through because they ve been there 
Ask your healthcare professional if a group is in your area 
Parents play a very important role in helping their children recover from these illnesses 
Give your child a safe space to talk and share feelings without judgment 
Eating at routine times is important to reduce binge eating 
An eating disorder is not a choice or something your child does 
It s a complex illness that affects your child s brain and how your child makes decisions 
Your symptoms, even those that don t seem to be related to the appointment 
Some questions to ask your primary healthcare professional or mental health professional include 
Your doctor will likely prescribe one or a combination of the drugs 
The most common treatment is prednisone, which comes in pill form 
Corticosteroid ointment can be rubbed on your affected skin and causes fewer side effects 
You may need to change your routine until the blisters are under control 
Avoid prolonged sun exposure on any area of the skin affected by bullous pemphigoid 
Preparing for your appointmentYou may start by seeing your primary care doctor 
He or she may refer you to a doctor who specializes in skin disorders dermatologist 
You may want to bring a friend or relative to your appointment 
For bullous pemphigoid, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Have you observed any oozing, draining of pus or bleeding 
Treatment Most minor burns can be treated at home 
People with severe burns may require treatment at specialized burn centers 
And they may need emotional support and months of follow up care, such as physical therapy 
You may need intravenous IV fluids to prevent dehydration and organ failure 
You may need morphine and anti anxiety medications particularly for dressing changes 
These help prevent infection and prepare the wound to close 
If you develop an infection, you may need IV antibiotics 
Your doctor might recommend a tetanus shot after a burn injury 
These can help stretch the skin so that the joints can remain flexible 
Other types of exercises can improve muscle strength and coordination 
And occupational therapy may help if you have difficulty doing your normal daily activities 
Surgical and other proceduresYou may need one or more of the following procedures 
If you ve been burned on the face or neck, your throat may swell shut 
People with extensive burns or who are undernourished may need nutritional support 
Your doctor may thread a feeding tube through your nose to your stomach 
An eschar that goes completely around the chest can make it difficult to breathe 
Your doctor may cut the eschar to relieve this pressure 
Donor skin from deceased donors or pigs can be used as a temporary solution 
Lifestyle and home remediesTo treat minor burns, follow these steps 
Putting ice directly on a burn can cause further damage to the tissue 
Try to do this quickly and gently, before the burned area swells 
If a blister breaks, clean the area with water mild soap is optional 
Cover the burn with a sterile gauze bandage not fluffy cotton 
Wrap it loosely to avoid putting pressure on burned skin 
Bandaging keeps air off the area, reduces pain and protects blistered skin 
Make sure that your tetanus booster is up to date 
Doctors recommend that people get a tetanus shot at least every years 
Potential scarring, reduced mobility and possible surgeries add to the burden 
Ask your doctor for Information on support groups in your area or online 
For other burns, you may need an appointment with your family doctor 
List questions you want to ask your doctor, such as 
What are my treatment options and the pros and cons of each 
Can I wait to see if the burn heals on its own 
Do I need prescription medication, or can I use over the counter medications to treat the burn 
What skin care routines do you recommend while the burn heals 
What changes in my skin might I expect to see as it heals 
Have you noticed any changes in the appearance of the burn 
You may need a test to check the feeling in your thigh 
A thin needle called an electrode is placed into the muscle to record electrical activity 
A comparison of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve on each side may be performed 
This test might be done primarily to exclude other causes for the symptoms 
Treatment For most people, the symptoms of meralgia paresthetica ease in a few months 
They might include acetaminophen Tylenol, others , ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others or aspirin 
Injections can reduce inflammation and relieve pain for a short time 
Side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation and impaired sexual functioning 
This option is only for people with very painful and long lasting symptoms 
Key personal Information, including medical conditions and major stresses or recent life changes 
What to expect from your doctorYour healthcare professional may have question that include 
Do you regularly do repetitive activities that affect your hip area, such as cycling 
Diagnosis Doctors can often diagnose bursitis based on a medical history and physical exam 
Conservative measures, such as rest, ice and taking a pain reliever, can relieve discomfort 
This treatment generally works quickly and, in many cases, one injection is all you need 
Lifestyle and home remediesMeasures you can take to relieve the pain of bursitis include 
Apply ice to reduce swelling for the first hours after symptoms occur 
Apply dry or moist heat, such as a heating pad or taking a warm bath 
Some are available in a form you apply to the skin 
Does your pain occur or worsen during certain activities, such as kneeling or climbing stairs 
Compare the condition of both knees, especially if only one hurts 
Carefully move your legs and knees to determine your affected knee s range of motion 
Your healthcare professional might request one or more of the following tests 
These can be useful in finding a problem with a bone or arthritis 
These scans can produce images of soft tissues such as bursae 
Ultrasound can help your healthcare professional find swelling in the affected bursa 
AspirationRarely, a sample of bursa fluid may be taken for testing 
A needle is placed into the affected area to drain some of the fluid 
But your healthcare professional might recommend one or more treatments 
It depends on the cause of your knee bursitis and which bursa is infected 
Rarely, surgery to remove the infected bursa is done if medicine doesn t help 
This procedure may be done if medicines and self care don t help enough 
It can help drain extra fluid in the bursa and treat inflammation 
This helps the bursa to heal and lowers the chance of repeat swelling 
Lifestyle and home remediesTo ease pain and discomfort of knee bursitis 
Take a break from the activity that caused your symptoms 
Try not to kneel and make movements that make your pain worse 
Some medicines that are sold without a prescription can help ease pain 
They include aspirin, ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others or naproxen sodium Aleve 
Apply an ice pack to your knee for minutes at a time 
Use of a compressive wrap or knee sleeve can help ease swelling 
Preparing for your appointmentYou might start by seeing your primary healthcare professional 
Key personal Information, including the activities and exercises you perform 
A loved one can help you remember the Information you re given

A diagnosis of C difficile infection is based on having 
People who have regular, formed stools should not be tested for C difficile infection 
Some people get C difficile infection without having taken antibiotics 
These tests also can look for other causes of the symptoms 
A hole, called a perforation, in the lining of the colon 
Treatment Treatment s are used only for symptoms of infection 
People who carry the bacteria but aren t sick don t get treated 
Often, however, an antibiotic is needed to treat another infectious condition 
Metronidazole Flagyl may be used with vancomycin to treat serious C difficile infection 
SurgerySurgery to remove the diseased part of the colon may be needed if there s 
Swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the lining of the wall around the stomach area 
After three or more infections, the risk of another infection is greater than 
Are taking other antibiotics for another condition while on antibiotics for C difficile infection 
Treatment for C difficile infection that comes back might include the following 
Treatment for repeat infections may involve one or more courses of an antibiotic 
The antibiotic is often different from the one used at first 
Antibiotic therapy works less well each time the infection comes back 
A therapy known as bezlotoxumab Zinplava is a human antibody against C difficile toxin B 
FMT is a newer treatment for C difficile infection that keeps coming back 
FMT also is called a stool transplant or an intestinal microbiota transplant 
The role of these products in C difficile infection is not clear 
Researchers are studying advanced probiotics for treatment or prevention of C difficile infection

Treatment Multiple interventions are used to treat calciphylaxis, including 
A medication called sodium thiosulfate can decrease calcium buildup in the arterioles 
It s given intravenously three times a week, usually during dialysis 
Other medications may be used to improve the balance of calcium and phosphorus 
In some cases, tissue can be removed using other methods, such as wet dressings 
Antibiotic treatment is part of treating and preventing wound infection 
You may be offered medication for managing pain due to calciphylaxis or during wound care 
For calciphylaxis, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Diagnosis Your health care provider will likely diagnose corns and calluses by examining your feet 
This exam helps rule out other causes of thickened skin, such as warts and cysts 
If it bleeds or reveals black points dried blood , it s a wart, not a corn 
Treatment Treatment for corns and calluses is the same 
It involves avoiding the repetitive actions that caused them to form 
Wearing shoes that fit and using protective pads can help 
Don t try this yourself because it could lead to an infection 
This type of surgery can be done without an overnight hospital stay 
Soaking corns and calluses in warm, soapy water softens them 
This can make it easier to remove the thickened skin 
Apply a donut shaped foam pad to protect the area where a corn or callus formed 
Be careful using nonprescription liquid corn removers or medicated corn pads 
Wear well fitting, cushioned shoes and socks, at least until your corn or callus disappears 
For other cancers, screening tests are recommended only for people with increased risk 
A variety of medical organizations and patient advocacy groups have recommendations and guidelines for cancer screening 
Cancer diagnosisYour doctor may use one or more approaches to diagnose cancer 
Your doctor may feel areas of your body for lumps that may indicate cancer 
During a biopsy, your doctor collects a sample of cells for testing in the laboratory 
In most situations, a biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose cancer

Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about cervical cancer from 
What is the right amount of time between Pap smears 
What does it mean to have an abnormal Pap smear 
Having an abnormal Pap smear is very common, so don t feel alone 
It just means that additional tests are needed to prove that cervical cancer isn t present 
What is the age cut off for the HPV vaccine 
Should I still get the HPV vaccine if I already have cervical pre cancer 
After cervical pre cancer or even HPV exposure, the vaccine remains to provide benefit 
So I recommend HPV vaccination after pre cancer or even after cervical cancer 
Certainly, we aim to detect cervical cancer as early as possible 
Early stage cervical cancer has much improved overall survival and reduced recurrence 
Even though you ve been diagnosed with cervical cancer, family planning is still possible 
I highly recommend having a medical team that you re comfortable communicating with 
During a Pap test, a tool called a speculum holds the vaginal walls apart 
The cells are placed in a bottle that contains a solution to preserve them 
Or the cells may be smeared onto a glass slide 
Most medical organizations suggest beginning screening for cervical cancer and precancerous changes at age 
The cells are then examined in a lab to check for cells that look different 
A Pap test can detect cancer cells in the cervix 
It also can detect cells that have changes that increase the risk of cervical cancer 
Discuss your cervical cancer screening options with your health care team 
A special magnifying instrument, called a colposcope, is used to check for signs of cancer 
During the colposcopic exam, a doctor removes a sample of cervical cells for lab testing 
Punch biopsy, which uses a sharp tool to pinch off small samples of cervical tissue 
If the results of these tests are concerning, you might have more tests 
This test also may be called a loop electrosurgical excision procedure, also known as LEEP 
Your health care team uses the Information from staging tests to plan your treatment 
Tests might include X ray, MRI, CT and positron emission tomography PET scan 
The stages of vaginal cancer range from to 
The lowest number means that the cancer is only in the cervix 
As the numbers get higher, the cancer is more advanced 
Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of the three may be used 
SurgerySmall cervical cancers that haven t grown beyond the cervix are typically treated with surgery 
This option may make it possible for you to consider becoming pregnant in the future 
A small cervical cancer might be treated with a radical trachelectomy procedure 
Surgery to remove the cervix and uterus, called a hysterectomy 
This involves removing the cervix, uterus, part of the vagina and nearby lymph nodes 
A hysterectomy can often cure the cancer and stop it from coming back 
But removing the uterus makes it impossible to become pregnant 
This procedure involves making several small cuts in the abdomen rather than one large cut 
A radiation beam is directed at the affected area of the body 
If you haven t started menopause, radiation therapy might cause menopause 
Ask your health care team about ways to preserve your eggs before treatment 
This is because chemotherapy may enhance the effects of the radiation 
Higher doses of chemotherapy might be recommended to help control symptoms of very advanced cancer 
Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to reduce the size of the cancer

Using a scope to examine the inside of the colon 
For colon cancer, the tissue sample is often collected during a colonoscopy 
Other tests can give more Information about the cancer cells 
This result might indicate that a colon cancer is causing bleeding 
Colon cancers sometimes make a protein called carcinoembryonic antigen, also called CEA 
Blood tests can track the level of CEA over time 
The results might show whether the cancer is responding to treatment 
After treatment, CEA blood tests might detect if the cancer comes back 
The stages of colon cancer range from to 
At stage , the cancer only involves the inside the lining of the colon 
The health care team considers the cancer s stage when creating a treatment plan 
Staging tests might include imaging scans of the abdomen, pelvis and chest 
They show the location and the size of the colon cancer 
Often, doctors can t be certain of the cancer s stage until after colon cancer surgery 
The lowest numbers mean the cancer is all inside the lining of the colon

Treatment Colon cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer 
Your health care team might recommend other treatments, such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy 
Your treatment options depend on the cancer s location and its stage 
This type of surgery can remove polyps that can t be removed during a colonoscopy 
The surgeon also may take samples from lymph nodes in the area around the cancer 
If the cancer has grown into or through the colon, a surgeon might recommend 
Surgery to remove part of the colon is called partial colectomy 
During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of the colon that has the cancer 
The surgeon also takes some tissue on either side of the cancer 
It s often possible to reconnect the healthy portions of the colon or rectum 
This procedure can often be done by a minimally invasive approach called laparoscopy 
Surgery to create a way for waste to leave the body 
Sometimes the ostomy can t be reversed and stays for life 
Nearby lymph nodes are usually removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer 
This surgery can remove colon blockages and ease symptoms, such as bleeding or pain 
Chemotherapy might be used before or after this type of procedure 
This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term 
Chemotherapy can kill cancer cells that might be left after surgery 
This helps reduce the risk of the cancer coming back

There are some risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer, like smoking and obesity 
So the healthier you are, the less risk you might have of pancreatic cancer 
But ultimately if you have a pancreas, there s always a risk of developing pancreatic cancer 
The vast majority of pancreatic cysts will not become cancerous 
There are a few, but I would recommend asking your doctor about those 
The connection between breast cancer and pancreatic cancer is a genetic mutation called BRCA 
But fortunately with our new technologies, insulin pumps are much improved 
And therefore, patients still have a good quality of life 
Imaging tests take pictures that show the inside of the body 
EUS uses a long, thin tube with a camera, called an endoscope 
The endoscope passes down the throat and into the stomach 
An ultrasound device on the endoscope uses sound waves to create images of nearby tissues 
It can be used to make pictures of the pancreas 
Most often, a health professional gets the sample during EUS 
The sample goes to the lab for testing to see if its cancer 
Other specialized tests can show what DNA changes are present in the cancer cells 
The results help your health care team create your treatment plan 
Blood tests might show proteins called tumor markers that pancreatic cancer cells make 
One tumor marker test used in pancreatic cancer is called CA 
Some pancreatic cancers don t make extra CA , so this test isn t helpful for everyone

Surgery can cure pancreatic cancer, but it s not an option for everyone 
It might be used to treat cancer that hasn t spread to other organs 
In these situations, treatment might start with other options, such as chemotherapy 
It also involves removing the first part of the small intestine and the bile duct 
Sometimes the surgeon removes part of the stomach and nearby lymph nodes 
The remaining organs are rejoined to allow food to move through the digestive system 
Surgery for cancers in the body and tail of the pancreas 
Surgery to remove the body and tail of the pancreas is called distal pancreatectomy 
With this procedure, the surgeon also might need to remove the spleen 
The procedure might need to involve taking out and rebuilding parts of the blood vessels

These treatments may be considered for treating very small prostate cancers when surgery isn t possible 
Studies have found that focal therapy reduces the risk of side effects 
Hormone therapyHormone therapy is treatment to stop your body from producing the male hormone testosterone 
Prostate cancer cells rely on testosterone to help them grow 
These medications, known as anti androgens, usually are given in conjunction with LHRH agonists 
That s because LHRH agonists can cause a temporary increase in testosterone before testosterone levels decrease 
Removing your testicles reduces testosterone levels in your body quickly and significantly 
But unlike medication options, surgery to remove the testicles is permanent and irreversible 
It helps shrink the cancer and increases the effectiveness of radiation therapy 
Chemotherapy may also be an option for cancers that don t respond to hormone therapy 
It s an option for treating advanced prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone therapy

Everyone with retinoblastoma has variations in the RB gene in their cancer cells 
This can happen if parents pass DNA variations to their child 
Screening tests can help watch for those other kinds of cancer 
Treatment Common retinoblastoma treatments include chemotherapy, cold therapy and laser therapy 
Surgery to remove the eye can treat retinoblastoma, but it s only used in certain situations 
Which treatment is best for your child s retinoblastoma depends on several factors 
Your healthcare team also considers your child s overall health and your own preferences 
Other treatments might be needed after chemotherapy to kill any cancer cells that remain 
Chemotherapy medicines can be given through a vein or in pill form 
These medicines travel throughout the body to kill cancer cells 
Giving the medicines in this way is called systemic chemotherapy 
Treatment is typically given monthly for several months 
Chemotherapy medicines can be put into an artery near the eye 
The tube is advanced through the body until it gets near the eye 
Then the medicine is released through the tube 
Giving the medicine in this way is called intra arterial chemotherapy 
It lets the healthcare team give the medicine directly to the eye 
Treatment is typically done monthly for a few months 
Sometimes chemotherapy medicines are injected in the eye with a needle 
This way of giving the medicines is called intravitreal chemotherapy 
Cold therapyCold therapy, also called cryotherapy, uses extreme cold to damage cancer cells 
It s typically used after chemotherapy to kill any cancer cells that are left 
For very small retinoblastomas, cryotherapy might be the only treatment needed 
During cryotherapy, a very cold instrument is placed on the eye 
This process of freezing and thawing is repeated a few times in each cryotherapy session 
Laser therapyLaser therapy uses a laser light to heat up and damage the cancer cells 
For very small retinoblastomas, laser therapy might be the only treatment needed 
A device that emits radiation can be placed on the eye 
This type of radiation therapy is typically used for cancers that don t respond to chemotherapy 
The energy beams can be made of X rays, protons or other kinds of radiation 
Surgeons disconnect the muscles and tissue around the eye and remove the eyeball 
The muscles that control eye movement are sometimes attached to the implant 
After your child heals, the eye muscles will adapt to the implant

That way the cancer can be removed without needing to remove the entire limb 
During intraoperative radiation therapy IORT , radiation is directed to where it s needed 
The dose of IORT can be much higher than is possible with standard radiation therapy 
The machine directs radiation to specific points on your body 
Radiation before surgery can shrink a tumor to make it easier to remove 
Radiation during surgery allows more radiation to be delivered directly to the target area 
Radiation may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain

Treatment Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin can be removed with minor surgery 
Some are removed with a medicine applied to the skin 
Then an electric needle is used to sear the base of the cancer 
This treatment uses an intense beam of light to destroy growths 
And there s a reduced risk of bleeding, swelling and scarring 
This treatment, called cryosurgery, involves freezing cancer cells with liquid nitrogen 
Later, a light that destroys the skin cancer cells is shined on the area 
This treatment might be used with surgery or other treatments 
This involves cutting out the cancer and a margin of healthy skin around it 
Sometimes more skin around the tumor is removed, called a wide excision 
It also might be an option for people who can t have or don t want surgery

Diagnosis You might find lumps, swelling or other symptoms of testicular cancer on your own 
They can be detected during an exam by a health care provider too 
You ll need other tests to see if testicular cancer is causing your symptoms 
A testicular ultrasound test uses sound waves to make pictures 
It can be used to make pictures of the scrotum and testicles 
During an ultrasound you lie on your back with your legs spread 
A health care provider puts a clear gel on the scrotum 
A hand held probe is moved over the scrotum to make the pictures 
Ultrasound gives your provider more clues about any lumps around the testicle 
An ultrasound shows whether the lumps are inside or outside the testicle 
Lumps inside the testicle are more likely to be testicular cancer 
A blood test can detect proteins made by testicular cancer cells 
This type of test is called a tumor marker test 
Tumor markers for testicular cancer include beta human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha fetoprotein and lactate dehydrogenase 
Having these substances in your blood doesn t mean you have cancer 
Your care team considers your cancer type when deciding on your treatment 
Seminoma testicular cancers tend to happen at an older age 
They include choriocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, teratoma and yolk sac tumor 
Other types of testicular cancer exist, but they are very rare 
CT scans take a series of X ray pictures of your belly, chest and pelvis 
A health care provider checks the pictures for signs that cancer has spread 
Tumor marker tests are often repeated after surgery to remove the testicle 
Tumor marker tests might be used during and after cancer treatment to monitor your condition 
The stages of testicular cancer range from to 
Stage testicular cancers have spread to the lymph nodes 
When testicular cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is stage 
Treatment Testicular cancer treatment often involves surgery and chemotherapy 
To remove the testicle, a surgeon makes a cut in the groin 
A prosthetic, gel filled testicle can be inserted if you choose 
This might be the only treatment needed if the cancer hasn t spread beyond the testicle 
To remove the lymph nodes, the surgeon makes a cut in the belly 
The lymph nodes are tested in a lab to look for cancer 
Testicular cancer surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection 
Ask your health care provider about options for preserving your sperm before surgery 
It can kill cancer cells that may have spread beyond the testicle 
It can help kill any cancer cells that are still in the body 
When testicular cancer is very advanced, sometimes chemotherapy is used before surgery 
Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the specific medicines being used 
Common side effects include fatigue, hearing loss and an increased risk of infection 
Chemotherapy also may cause your body to stop making sperm 
Often, sperm production starts again as you get better after cancer treatment 
Ask your health care provider about your options for preserving your sperm before chemotherapy

This means that the thyroid cancer is not life threatening and very treatable 
In a small group of patients, the disease may be advanced 
Fortunately, for small thyroid cancers, it does not impact the function of the gland 
We measure the function of the gland by measuring hormones called TSH and T 
And if these are normal, it means the thyroid function has been preserved 
This hormone is bioidentical to the hormone your thyroid produced 
And there s no side effects when you re on the right dose 
Cells are removed and analyzed to see if they are cancerous 
Ultrasound uses high frequency sound waves to create pictures of body structures 
Ultrasound imaging is typically used to precisely guide the needle 
Your provider uses the needle to remove some cells from the thyroid 
It s most often used after surgery to find any cancer cells that might remain 
This test is most helpful for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers 
Healthy thyroid cells absorb and use iodine from the blood 
Any cells that take up the iodine are shown on the radioactive iodine scan images 
Cancer stage is indicated with a number between and 
Different types of thyroid cancer have different sets of stages 
For instance, medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers each have their own set of stages 
For differentiated thyroid cancers, your stage may vary based on your age 
In some people, the cancer might never grow and never require treatment 
In others, growth may eventually be detected and treatment can begin 
The four tiny parathyroid glands, which lie near the thyroid, make the parathyroid hormone 
Your care team also considers your preferences when creating a treatment plan 
During a thyroid lobectomy, the surgeon removes half of the thyroid 
Thyroid cancer often spreads to nearby lymph nodes in the neck 
After surgery, you can expect some pain as your body heals 
Most people start to feel recovered in to days 
Thyroglobulin a protein made by healthy thyroid cells and differentiated thyroid cancer cells 
Calcitonin a hormone made by medullary thyroid cancer cells 
Carcinoembryonic antigen a chemical produced by medullary thyroid cancer cells 
These blood tests are also used to look for signs of cancer recurrence 
Thyroid hormone therapy medication is usually taken in pill form 
High doses of thyroid hormone therapy might be recommended for aggressive thyroid cancers 
Differentiated thyroid cancer types, including papillary, follicular and Hurthle cell, are more likely to respond 
Anaplastic and medullary thyroid cancers usually aren t treated with radioactive iodine 
Radioactive iodine treatment comes as a capsule or liquid that you swallow 
Which side effects you experience will depend on the dose of radioactive iodine you receive 
Sometimes it s an option if you aren t healthy enough for surgery 
Targeted drug treatments focus on specific chemicals present within cancer cells 
Some of these treatments come in pill form and some are given through a vein 
There are many different targeted therapy drugs for thyroid cancer 
Side effects will depend on the specific drug you take 
Radiation therapy can help control pain caused by cancer that spreads to the bones 
Radiation therapy side effects depend on where the radiation is aimed 
Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells 
There are many different chemotherapy drugs that can be used alone or in combination 
Some come in pill form, but most are given through a vein 
Chemotherapy may help control fast growing thyroid cancers, such as anaplastic thyroid cancer 
In certain situations, chemotherapy might be used for other types of thyroid cancer 
Chemotherapy side effects depend on the specific drugs you receive 
Radiofrequency ablation uses electrical energy to heat up cancer cells, causing them to die 
Cryoablation uses a gas to freeze and kill cancer cells 
These treatments can help control small areas of cancer cells 
Increasingly, palliative care is being offered early in the course of cancer treatment

These lab tests can show how well the kidneys are working 
Imaging tests may include ultrasound, CT scans or MRI and chest X rays 
In the United States, the stages for Wilms tumor are 
The cancer has spread beyond the kidney, such as to nearby fat or blood vessels 
It might also have spread to other places within the abdomen 
Some children with Wilms tumor may be candidates for s proton beam therapy 
This highly advanced technology targets and destroys cancer while sparing healthy tissue 
Treatment for Wilms tumor usually involves surgery and chemotherapy 
Treatment s depend on the stage of the cancer 
The kidney that s left can take on the work of both kidneys 
The child would then need kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant 
ChemotherapyChemotherapy uses strong medicines to kill cancer cells throughout the body 
Ask your child s health care team what side effects might happen during treatment 
Ask if there might be long term problems as a result of treatment 
If given before surgery, chemotherapy can shrink tumors and make them easier to remove 
After surgery, it can kill cancer cells that are left in the body 
For children who have cancer in both kidneys, chemotherapy is given before surgery 
This may make it more likely that one kidney might be saved 
Radiation therapy uses high powered energy beams to kill cancer cells 
During radiation therapy, the child is placed on a table 
A large machine moves around the child, pointing energy beams at the cancer 
Possible side effects include nausea, diarrhea, tiredness and sunburn like skin irritation

Dr Ommen Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy or heart muscle disease 
So really, the onset can be at any time of life 
So operation to relieve outflow tract obstruction is to relieve the symptoms 
Dr Ommen Surgical myectomy has been a very successful operation for many of our patients 
By doing this, it changes the direction the blood flows through the ventricle 
And allows blood to leave the heart without increasing pressures or increasing forces 
Dr Schaff We found that it s rarely necessary to do something to the mitral valve 
An operation is available for some patients that have non obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
And these are patients with the apical distribution of hypertrophy 
Some of those patients have diastolic heart failure related to very small ventricular cavities 
Dr Schaff At , we ve done over , operations for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
First degree relatives who are adolescents or athletes, we usually screen every to months

The pattern of your symptoms is important in making a diagnosis 
They also tend to occur at night and may wake you from sleep 
Or you may notice the numbness when you wake up in the morning 
But the median nerve doesn t provide sensation to the little finger 
However, X rays are not helpful in making a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome 
An ultrasound of the wrist provides a picture of the tendons and nerves 
This can help show whether the nerve is being compressed 
This test measures the tiny electrical discharges produced in muscles 
This test can identify damage to the muscles controlled by the median nerve 
In a variation of electromyography, two electrodes are taped to the skin 
This test may be used to diagnose the condition and rule out other conditions 
Treatment Treat carpal tunnel syndrome as early as possible after symptoms start 
If you have numbness in your hands, get treatment from a healthcare professional 
There isn t evidence, however, that these medicines improve carpal tunnel syndrome 
Corticosteroids decrease inflammation and swelling, which relieves pressure on the median nerve 
Oral corticosteroids aren t considered as effective as corticosteroid injections for treating carpal tunnel syndrome

Diagnosis of CAS isn t based on a single test or observation 
A diagnosis is made based on the pattern of problems that are seen 
The speech language pathologist also will look for other problems such as low muscle tone 
As your child improves, the number of weekly speech therapy sessions may be reduced 
One on one therapy allows your child to have more time to practice speech during each session 
Speech language pathologists may use different types of cues in speech therapy 
For example, your child s speech language pathologist may ask your child to listen carefully 
For example, a speech language pathologist may help round your child s lips to say oo 
No single speech therapy approach has been shown to be most effective for treating CAS 
But some important principles of speech therapy for CAS include 
Your child will likely practice syllables, words or phrases, rather than isolated sounds 
Children with CAS need practice making the movements from one sound to another 
For example, your child may be asked to say hi, mine and bite 
Or your child may be asked to say out, down and house 
The number of words for practice will likely be gradually increased as your child improves 
Each home practice session can be short, such as five minutes in length 
Children also need to practice words and phrases in real life situations 
Create situations for your child to say the word or phrase 
For example, ask your child to say Hi, Mom each time mom enters a room 
This makes it easier for your child to say the practice words automatically 
For example, your child could use signs to ask for a cookie 
Sometimes electronic devices such as tablets can be helpful in communication 
It may help your child become less frustrated when trying to communicate 
Therapies for coexisting problemsMany children with CAS also have delays in their language development 
Lifestyle and home remediesYou and your family can work with your child at home 
Home practice, in addition to your child s speech therapy sessions, may help your child s progress 
Encourage and support your child as your child practices speech and language skills 
Your child is likely to feel good about making improvements in speech with your support 
Be mindful of giving your child rests from therapy, as well 
Coping and supportIt can be hard to have a child who has problems communicating 
To learn about support groups in your area, see the Apraxia Kids website 
Bring a list of all medicines, vitamins or supplements that your child is taking 
Write down questions to ask your child s health care team and speech language pathologist 
For childhood apraxia of speech CAS , some basic questions to ask the speech language pathologist include 
Does my child have CAS, or any other speech or language problems 
How is CAS different from other types of speech disorders 
What can I do at home to help my child 
When did you first have concerns about your child s speech development 
At what age did your child s vocabulary include five words that were used frequently 
For example, does your child point, make gestures, make signs or act things out 
Has anyone in your family had speech or language problems 
One eye is tested at a time, while the other eye is covered 
A chart or a viewing device with letters that get smaller is used 
The slit allows your doctor to view these structures in small sections 
This makes it easier to find anything that may be wrong 
A retinal exam looks at the back of your eyes, called the retina 
This test, also called applanation tonometry, measures fluid pressure in your eye 
But cataracts can worsen faster in people with certain conditions 
Waiting to do cataract surgery typically won t affect how well your vision recovers 
Take time to consider the benefits and risks of cataract surgery with your doctor 
How often you ll see your eye doctor depends on your situation 
The most common type of cataract surgery is called phacoemulsification 
During this process, the rapidly vibrating tip of an ultrasound probe breaks up the cataract 
Your surgeon then suctions out the lens, as seen in the top image 
An outer housing of the cataract, called the lens capsule, is generally left in place 
Cataract surgery involves removing the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear artificial lens 
This means you won t need to stay in a hospital after the surgery 
Cataract surgery also increases the risk of the retina being pulled out of place 
After the procedure, you may be sore for a few days 
There are some things about aging you just can t control

Bloodwork and imaging tests help your provider rule out other causes of stomach pain 
The sound occurs when a blood vessel is blocked or narrowed 
Tests used to rule out other conditions and diagnose MALS may include 
A complete blood cell count shows the level of white and red blood cells 
A high white blood cell count can mean there s an infection 
It s done to view the esophagus, stomach and upper part of the small intestine duodenum 
If needed, the provider can take tissue samples biopsy during this procedure 
Compression of the celiac artery can slow the rate of stomach emptying 
Gastric emptying studies are done to determine how fast the stomach empties its contents 
Slow or delayed gastric emptying may be from other medical conditions 
A CT scan uses X rays to create cross sectional images of specific parts of the body 
An abdominal CT scan can show if the celiac artery is narrowed or blocked 
Treatment Surgery is the only treatment option for MALS 
The most common procedure is called median arcuate ligament release, or median arcuate ligament decompression 
Sometimes it can be done as a minimally invasive laparoscopic or robotic procedure 
It restores blood flow and relieves pressure on the nerves 
It often results in immediate pain relief and improves the person s quality of life

One method uses a hand held machine to knead the skin between rollers Endermologie 
Endermologie has FDA approval as a medical device with little potential to cause harm 
You might notice a slight improvement to your skin after a number of sessions 
One method also uses fat grafting to improve skin appearance 
Results from these techniques may last two to three years 
Complications of these techniques may include pain and bleeding beneath the skin 
Some that show potential use a combination of liposuction and ultrasound or laser 
Liposuction alone won t remove cellulite, and it might worsen the appearance of your skin

Lifestyle and home remediesSelf care can help improve the look of your skin 
Applying retinol cream has been shown to improve the appearance of cellulite 
Any effect from a retinol cream won t be noticeable for six months or longer 
Activities that tone muscles may help improve the appearance of dimpled skin 
For cellulite, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Diagnosis A primary care professional might evaluate your condition based on your symptoms 
Or you may be referred to a sleep specialist in a sleep disorder center 
A sleep specialist can help you decide on your need for further evaluation 
In a split night sleep study, you re monitored during the first half of the night 
The therapy might be positive airway pressure or supplemental oxygen 
These other disorders can cause excessive daytime sleepiness but require different treatment 
You might need imaging of your head or heart to look for contributing conditions 
These devices deliver pressurized air through a tight sealing mask to help support breathing 
For example, therapy for heart failure might improve central sleep apnea 
CPAP may prevent the airway closure that can trigger central sleep apnea 
If CPAP doesn t effectively treat your condition, you might be given ASV 
Unlike CPAP, ASV adjusts the amount of pressure breath by breath when you take a breath 
Using supplemental oxygen while you sleep might help if you have central sleep apnea 
Various devices are available to deliver oxygen to your lungs 
Surgery or other proceduresA newer therapy for central sleep apnea is transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation 
Used for moderate to severe central sleep apnea, this system produces a steady breathing pattern 
This person will likely be able to provide your doctor with additional Information 
Make a list of all medicines, vitamins or supplements you take, including doses 
For central sleep apnea, some basic questions to ask include 
How long do you sleep, and do you sleep soundly 
Has anyone ever told you that you stop breathing while you re sleeping

They may help with function, such as improved walking, and stretching stiff muscles 
Speech therapists also can address issues with eating and swallowing 
This type of therapy can help improve your child s motor skills, speech and emotional well being 
Children with muscle tissue shortening, known as contractures, might need surgery 
Surgical procedures also can lengthen muscles and lengthen or reposition tendons that are shortened 
The procedures also can make it easier to use a walker, braces or crutches 
This relaxes the muscle in the legs and reduces pain 
Children with cerebral palsy need general health screenings recommended for all adults 
Alternative medicinesome children and teenagers with cerebral palsy use complementary and alternative medicine 
Alternative therapies are not proved and have not been adopted into routine clinical practice 
The health professional also may ask if you had risk factors during pregnancy or delivery 
All medicines, vitamins and other supplements your child takes, including doses 
Can you suggest educational materials and local support services regarding cerebral palsy

Gadolinium is a substance called a contrast agent that highlights tissues in the body 
Then, several images of the area are taken over a hour period 
These images watch for changes in the flow of CSF that may indicate a leak 
It is usually performed as part of another test for CSF leak 
For example, a spinal tap is required at the start of myelography or cisternography 
The physical exam includes close evaluation of your nose and ears 
An MRI scan may be used to help detect a CSF leak inside the brain 
Clear fluid coming out of the ear is a symptom of a CSF leak 
This test is considered the gold standard for diagnosing and locating cranial CSF leaks 
High resolution CT provides images in even greater detail and also may be used 
More Information CSF leak Cerebrospinal fluid leak care at MRI 
Treatment Some CSF leaks improve with bed rest alone, but most need treatment 
There are several types of surgical treatments that repair CSF leaks

Treatment Emergency treatment depends on whether you re having an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke 
During an ischemic stroke, blood vessels in the brain are blocked or narrowed 
Ischemic strokeTo treat an ischemic stroke, blood flow must quickly be restored to the brain 
The sooner the medicine is given, the better 
Quick treatment improves your chances of survival and may reduce complications 
The two types of TPA are alteplase Activase and tenecteplase TNKase 
Sometimes, TPA can be given up to hours after stroke symptoms started 
This medicine restores blood flow by dissolving the blood clot causing the stroke 
Healthcare professionals sometimes treat ischemic strokes directly inside the blocked blood vessel 
Endovascular therapy has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce long term disability after ischemic stroke 
This procedure often is performed in combination with injected TPA 
A balloon is then inflated to expand the narrowed artery 
Then a stent can be inserted to support the opened artery 
These treatments include medicines or a transfusion of blood products 
Surgery also may be used to repair blood vessel damage associated with hemorrhagic strokes 
An aneurysm is a bulge at a weak spot in a blood vessel 
Or the clamp can keep an aneurysm that has recently burst from bleeding again 
A catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and guided to the brain 
Using the catheter, a surgeon places tiny coils into the aneurysm to fill it 
This blocks blood flow into the aneurysm and causes blood to clot 
Surgical removal of a tangle of thin walled blood vessels, known as an AVM 
This removes the risk of rupture and lowers the risk of hemorrhagic stroke 
It also may not be possible to remove if the procedure would impact brain function 
This procedure uses multiple beams of highly focused radiation to repair blood vessel malformations 
Stereotactic radiosurgery is an advanced treatment that s not as invasive as other procedures 
After emergency treatment, you re closely monitored for at least a day 
Most people who have had a stroke go to a rehabilitation program 
Your healthcare professional can recommend the therapy program that is right for you 
After discharge, you might continue the program in a rehabilitation unit of the same hospital

Diagnosis Your health care provider will take a medical history and do an exam 
The exam will include checking for tenderness, numbness and muscle weakness 
Imaging testsImaging tests might help find the cause of the neck pain 
An EMG can determine whether neck pain might be related to a pinched nerve 
It involves inserting fine needles through the skin into a muscle 
The test measures the speed of nerve conduction to determine whether nerves are working properly 
A physical therapist can teach correct posture, alignment and neck strengthening exercises 
However, there s little evidence that TENS works for neck pain 
Numbing medications, such as lidocaine, also can be injected to relieve neck pain 
Lifestyle and home remediesBesides taking pain relievers, self care measures that might relieve neck pain include 
Try taking a warm shower or using a heating pad on the low setting

cardiologist Stephen Kopecky, M D , answers the most frequently asked questions about coronary artery disease CAD 
Many small changes can lead to great benefit over time 
Remember that nothing you do to improve your health is ever too little 
And nothing you do to improve your health is ever too late 
And every plaque or narrowing of your arteries contains cholesterol 
All the studies that have shown regression of arterial narrowing have done three things 
First, take care of the obvious factors like high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol 
I tell people they have a new part time job called Your Health 
To diagnose coronary artery disease, a health care provider will examine you 
You ll likely be asked questions about your medical history and any symptoms 
Blood tests are usually done to check your overall health 
TestsTest to help diagnose or monitor coronary artery disease include 
It can show how fast or slow the heart is beating 
An echocardiogram can show how blood moves through the heart and heart valves 
This may be a sign of coronary artery disease or other conditions 
The tracer helps the heart arteries show up more clearly on images 
The dye helps create detailed pictures of the heart arteries 
If dye is used, the test is called a CT coronary angiogram 
The dye helps blood vessels show up better on the images and outlines any blockages 
A mesh tube stent is typically used to keep the artery open 
MedicationsThere are many drugs available to treat coronary artery disease, including 
Medications can help lower bad cholesterol and reduce plaque buildup in the arteries 
Such drugs include statins, niacin, fibrates and bile acid sequestrants 
If you ve had a heart attack, beta blockers may reduce the risk of future attacks 
Calcium channel blockers can help improve symptoms of chest pain 
Angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers ARBs 
They may help keep coronary artery disease from getting worse 
It may be prescribed with or instead of a beta blocker 
The stent helps hold the artery open so blood can flow through it C 
Coronary artery bypass surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to the heart 
Sometimes it s taken from a leg vein, called the saphenus vein 
A tiny balloon is inflated to help widen the blocked artery and improve blood flow 
A small wire mesh tube stent may be placed in the artery during angioplasty 
Some stents slowly release medication to help keep the arteries open 
It s usually done only in those with many narrowed heart arteries 
You may need more frequent checks if you have a history of high blood pressure 
Ask your health care provider what blood pressure goal is best for you 
Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts 
Early detection and treatment can help you maintain better heart health 
Alternative medicine Omega fatty acids are a type of unsaturated fatty acid 
It s thought that they can lower inflammation throughout the body 
Fish and fish oil are the most effective sources of omega fatty acids 
Fish oil supplements may offer benefit, but the evidence is strongest for eating fish 
Flax and flaxseed oil contain a type of omega fatty acid called alpha linolenic acid ALA 
ALA contains smaller amounts of omega fatty acids than do fish and fish oil 
Some studies haven t found ALA to be as effective as fish 
Flaxseed also contains a lot of fiber, which has various health benefits 
Alpha linolenic acid ALA can also be found in canola oil, soybeans and soybean oil 
Plant sterols found in supplements and some margarines, such as Promise, Smart Balance and Benecol 
You may need to avoid food or drinks for a short while before some tests

Here are some guidelines for when to take a COVID test 
If you have COVID symptoms, test for the illness right away 
These tests look for genetic material from the COVID virus 
Polymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests 
Antigen tests also may be called rapid COVID tests or at home COVID tests 
These tests are useful if you need a quick result 
Antigen tests are reliable and accurate, but they are less accurate than PCR tests 
If you get a negative PCR test, you most likely do not have COVID 
With or without symptoms, repeating the test helps get the correct diagnosis

How likely is it that COVID is causing my symptoms 
However, your symptoms could be due to another disease that affects the brain 
Sometimes, these tests are performed every few months to look for changes in the brain 
Positron emission tomography PET scans can identify brain changes related to corticobasal degeneration 
However, more research needs to be done in this area 
Your healthcare professional may test your blood or cerebrospinal fluid for amyloid and tau proteins 
This can determine whether Alzheimer s disease is the cause of your symptoms 
More Information Corticobasal degeneration corticobasal syndrome care at Positron emission tomography scanSPECT scan 
But if your symptoms are due to Alzheimer s disease, new medicines may be available 
Your healthcare professional may recommend medicines to try to manage your symptoms 
Occupational and physical therapy may help you manage the disabilities caused by corticobasal degeneration 
Or you may be referred immediately to a specialist, such as a neurologist 
For example, you might ask if you need to fast before a specific test 
Many children with MIS C test negative for a current infection with the COVID virus 
It also can be collected by noting infections among a child s close contacts 
Providers also may order tests to look for inflammation and other signs of MIS C 
Treatment Children with MIS C are treated in a hospital 
Fluids, if levels are too low, a condition called dehydration 
medicines that lower the risk of blood clots, such as aspirin or heparin 
Treatment to limit swelling and inflammation may include 
Intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG , a blood product made up of antibodies 
So the hospital will use infection control measures while caring for your child 
Because MIS C is rare, you likely don t know anyone who has been through this experience 
To help cope with the emotional toll this can take, ask for support 
Remember to wear a mask to protect yourself and others 
All medicines, vitamins or other supplements your child takes, including the dosages 
Any group activities your child recently took part in, including the dates

Urologist Tobias Kohler, M D , answers the most frequently asked questions about erectile dysfunction 
I m here to answer some of the important questions you may have about erectile dysfunction 
The blood vessels that feed the penis are relatively small 
Blood vessels in the heart and the neck are a little bit bigger 
And so, if it happens occasionally, you don t need to be as worried about that 
When young men have problems with erections, most of the time it s a confidence issue 
And so, there are different ways to deal with that 
One way is to give medications to get the confidence back 
This test is usually performed by a specialist in an office 
Your partner s preferences also might play a role in your treatment choices 
Oral medicationsOral medications are a successful erectile dysfunction treatment for many men 
Taking one of these tablets will not automatically produce an erection 
These medications amplify that signal, allowing normal penile function in some people 
The medications vary in dosage, how long they work and side effects 
Possible side effects include flushing, nasal congestion, headache, visual changes, backache and stomach upset 
Your doctor will consider your particular situation to determine which medication might work best 
Each injection is dosed to create an erection lasting no longer than an hour 
Because the needle used is very fine, pain from the injection site is usually minor 
You use a special applicator to insert the suppository into your penile urethra 
A penis pump is used to draw blood into the penis to create an erection 
This creates a vacuum that pulls blood into your penis 
The erection typically lasts long enough for a couple to have sex 
This treatment involves surgically placing devices into both sides of the penis 
These implants consist of either inflatable or malleable bendable rods 
Inflatable devices allow you to control when and how long you have an erection 
Penile implants are usually not recommended until other methods have been tried first 
As with any surgery, there s a risk of complications, such as infection 
Penile implant surgery is not recommended if you currently have a urinary tract infection 
Even less strenuous, regular exercise might reduce the risk of erectile dysfunction 
Increasing your level of activity might also further reduce your risk 
remediesFor many people, erectile dysfunction is caused or worsened by lifestyle choices 
Being overweight can cause or worsen erectile dysfunction 
Some alternative products that claim to work for erectile dysfunction can be dangerous 
The dosages might also be unknown, or they might have been contaminated during formulation 
Some of these drugs can interact with prescription drugs and cause dangerously low blood pressure 
These products are especially dangerous for anyone who takes nitrates 
This can cause anxiety, which might make erectile dysfunction worse

Hi, I m Dr Megan Wasson, a minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon at 
I m here to answer some of the important questions that you might have about endometriosis 
I wish I could tell you the answer to that, but unfortunately, we don t know 
In those scenarios, we can frequently see that disease either on ultrasound or on MRI 
When we talk about infertility, those are patients who are struggling with pregnancy already 
They walk home from the hospital with a beautiful baby in their arms 
But the vast majority of the time, it s truly not a problem 
Being a partner for the medical team is truly key 
You ll be asked to describe your symptoms, including where and when you feel pain 
Often, small areas of endometriosis can t be felt unless a cyst has formed 
This test uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body 
But it can find cysts linked with the condition called endometriomas 
It gives your surgeon detailed Information about the location and size of endometriosis growths 
In some cases, you may be referred to a surgeon for this procedure 
Laparoscopy lets the surgeon check inside your abdomen for signs of endometriosis tissue 
Your surgeon may take a tissue sample called biopsy for more testing 
Treatment Treatment for endometriosis often involves medicine or surgery 
Hormone therapySometimes, hormone medicine help ease or get rid of endometriosis pain 
Birth control pills, shots, patches and vaginal rings help control the hormones that stimulate endometriosis 
Many have lighter and shorter menstrual flow when they use hormonal birth control 
Using hormonal contraceptives may ease or get rid of pain in some cases 
These medicines block the menstrual cycle and lower estrogen levels 
Menstrual periods and the ability to get pregnant return when you stop taking the medicine 
These are a class of medicines that lower the amount of estrogen in the body 
Your surgeon may do this procedure with small cuts, also called laparoscopic surgery 
But even in severe cases of endometriosis, most can be treated with the laparoscopic method 
Surgical tools are inserted to remove endometriosis tissue through another small cut 
Some surgeons do laparoscopy with help from robotic devices that they control

These include heavy menstrual bleeding and painful menses due to uterine cramping 
That s especially true if you have the surgery before age 
You may want to get a second opinion before you start any treatment 
Lifestyle and home remediesIt may take time to find a treatment that works 
Until then, you can try some things at home to ease your pain 
Warm baths and a heating pad can help relax pelvic muscles 
Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs can help ease painful menstrual cramps 
NSAIDs include ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others and naproxen sodium Aleve 
You also can ask your health care team if physical therapy might help 
Relaxing these tight muscles may help pelvic pain linked with endometriosis feel less intense 
Some people with endometriosis say they get pain relief from alternative therapies such as 
Acupuncture, in which a trained practitioner places fine needs into the skin 
Chiropractic care, in which a licensed professional adjusts the spine or other body parts 
For example, supplements and herbs can affect standard treatments such as medicines 
Check with your insurance company to see if the expense will be covered 
If you can t find a support group in your community, look for one online 
So it s a good idea to plan ahead for your appointment 
Make a list of any medicines, herbs or vitamin supplements you take 
Include how often you take them and how much you take, called the dose 
Have a family member or close friend join you, if possible 
List your most important questions first, to be sure you bring up those points 
For endometriosis, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Is there a medicine that can ease my symptoms 
What side effects can I expect from medicine 
Make sure that you understand everything your health care team tells you 
It s fine to ask your team to repeat Information or to ask follow up questions 
What to expect from your doctorSome questions your doctor might ask include 
Do your symptoms seem to be related to your menstrual cycle 
For example, you ll likely be asked about your symptoms and any medicines 
You re also given a medical exam to check your breast tissue, stomach area and genitals 
Tests also may be done to check for breast cancer 
Computerized tomography CT scans This is a series of X rays taken from different angles 
Some people, especially those with obesity, have breast fat that looks like gynecomastia 
For people diagnosed with this condition, more testing isn t needed 
Breast cancer is uncommon in men, but it can happen 
This is inflamed breast tissue that sometimes involves an infection 
Treatment Gynecomastia often goes away over time without treatment 
But if gynecomastia is caused by a medical condition, that condition may need treatment 
Your doctor may have you stop the medicine or try a different one 
Gynecomastia in teens often goes away without treatment in less than two years 
Treatment may be needed if gynecomastia doesn t get better on its own 
Treatment also can help if the condition causes pain, tenderness or embarrassment 
In the United States, these medicines are approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
But they have not been approved specifically for use in people with gynecomastia 
If your appearance or other symptoms bother you, surgery may be a treatment choice 
This surgery removes breast fat but not the breast gland tissue itself 
With smaller amounts of gland tissue, mastectomy can be done using small incisions 
Coping and supportFor people with gynecomastia, having enlarged breasts can be stressful and embarrassing 
During puberty, gynecomastia can make teens a target for teasing from peers as well 
It can make activities such as swimming or changing in the locker room traumatic 
Whatever your age, if you have gynecomastia, you might feel unhappy with your body 
But you can take steps that may help you cope 
Some people with gynecomastia worry that their symptoms are due to a more serious condition 
It can be a relief to learn that gynecomastia is the cause 
Talk therapy can help you manage anxiety or depression caused by gynecomastia 
You may feel embarrassed to talk about gynecomastia with the people you care about 
It might feel good to talk with people who understand what you re going through 
Websites such as Gynecomastia org can help you connect with others who have the condition 
Diagnosis An enlarged spleen is usually detected during a physical exam 
Your doctor can often feel it by gently examining your left upper belly 
Your doctor might order these tests to confirm the diagnosis of an enlarged spleen 
Liquid and solid bone marrow samples are usually taken from the pelvis 
A needle is inserted into the bone through an incision 
You ll receive either a general or a local anesthetic before the test to ease discomfort 
A needle biopsy of the spleen is rare because of the risk of bleeding 
More Information Bone marrow biopsyComplete blood count CBC CT scanLiver function testsMRINeedle biopsyX rayShow more related Information 
Treatment Treatment for an enlarged spleen focuses on the what s causing it 
For example, if you have a bacterial infection, treatment will include antibiotics 
In chronic or critical cases, surgery might offer the best hope for recovery 
You ll also need the pneumococcal vaccine every five years after surgery 
Calling your doctor at the first sign of a fever, which could indicate an infection 
Avoiding travel to parts of the world where certain diseases, such as malaria, are common 
If you re in a car accident, a seat belt can help protect your spleen 
Diagnosis Entropion can usually be diagnosed with a routine eye exam and physical 
Nonsurgical treatments are available to relieve symptoms and protect your eye from damage 
Small amounts of onabotulinumtoxinA Botox injected into the lower eyelid can turn the eyelid out 
You may get a series of injections, with effects lasting up to six months 
This procedure can be done in your doctor s office with local anesthesia 
After several months, your eyelid may turn itself back inward 
Use an antibiotic ointment on your eye for one week 
Artificial tears and eye ointments help protect your cornea and keep it lubricated 
Ask your doctor to demonstrate proper technique and placement of the tape 
For entropion, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Have you had any previous eye surgery or procedures on your eye or eyelid 
This will include determining whether you have gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD 
Some people with eosinophilic esophagitis will have an esophagus that looks typical 
During an endoscopy, a biopsy of your esophagus will be done 
If eosinophilic esophagitis is suspected, you may undergo some additional tests to confirm the diagnosis 
These tests look for the sources of your allergic reaction, also called allergens 
This test is performed in the health care provider s office 
As the sponge is pulled out, it will sample the esophageal tissues 
Treatment will involve one or more of the following 
Sometimes, it may be recommended to limit your diet even more 
Your provider will likely first prescribe an acid blocker such as a PPI 
This treatment is the easiest to use, but most people s symptoms don t improve 
This steroid is in a liquid form that is swallowed to treat eosinophilic esophagitis 
Dupilumab is a type of medicine known as a monoclonal antibody 
It works to block the action of certain proteins in the body that cause inflammation 
Or dilation may be a choice to avoid ongoing use of medication 
If your weight is at a healthy level, work to maintain it 
Ask your provider for help in creating a weight loss strategy that will work for you 
Are your symptoms worse after meals or after lying down 
Have you ever had food get stuck while you are swallowing 
Have you been treated with a topical steroid or food elimination diet 
Are your symptoms worse at certain times of the year 
Diagnosis Often, medical history and an exam are enough to diagnose tennis elbow 
More Information Tennis elbow care at Electromyography EMG MRIX rayShow more related Information 
Treatment Tennis elbow often gets better on its own 
This is to find the best ways to reduce stress on injured tissue 
A forearm strap or brace might reduce stress on the injured tissue 
Different types of shots into the affected tendon are used to treat tennis elbow 
This procedure uses ultrasound to guide a needle through a numbed tendon again and again 
Ultrasonic energy vibrates the needle so fast that the damaged tissue turns to liquid 
A tool placed on the skin delivers the shock waves 
The surgery might be open, which uses a large cut, known as an incision 
Or it can be done through several small openings, known as arthroscopic 
Lifestyle and home remediesThe following self care measures might relieve tennis elbow 
Try pain relievers such as ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others or naproxen sodium Aleve 
Apply ice or a cold pack for minutes to times a day 
Does any motion or activity make the pain better or worse 
Does your job involve repetitive motions of your wrist or arm 
Diagnosis Your health care provider may identify epidermolysis bullosa from the skin s appearance 
You or your child may need tests to confirm the diagnosis 
It uses reflected light to identify the layers of skin involved 
This test also identifies whether the proteins needed for skin growth are present and healthy 
A surgeon might recommend surgery to correct these conditions if they restrict movement 
Rehabilitation therapyWorking with a rehabilitation specialist can help in learning to live with epidermolysis bullosa 
Gene therapy, including a gel applied to wounds of people with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa 
Ask about safe ways to drain blisters before they get too large 
Ask about recommended products for keeping the affected areas moist 
Other options are mild solutions of diluted vinegar or bleach 
Soaking loosens stuck bandages and helps reduce the pain of changing bandages 
Use a sterile needle to puncture each new blister in two spots 
Spread petroleum jelly or other thick moisturizer on a nonstick bandage Mepilex, Telfa, Vaseline gauze 
Special wraps and gauze dressings are useful for this treatment 
Serve food and beverages lukewarm, at room temperature or cold 
Coping and supportHaving a child with epidermolysis bullosa affects every aspect of your life 
It can be emotionally distressing for you, your child and family members 
Children with this condition need the lifelong support of their health care team and families 
Treating and preventing blisters and worrying about complications can be stressful 
You may find it helpful to share concerns and experiences with families in similar circumstances 
Ask your health care provider about epidermolysis bullosa support groups in your area 
Ask your health care provider if a specialized epidermolysis bullosa center is available to you 
List your or your child s signs and symptoms and how long they ve been present 
Note any new sources of friction around the blistering areas, if any 
Ask a trusted family member or friend to join you for the appointment 
What s the most likely cause of the signs and symptoms 
What are other possible causes for these signs and symptoms 
What treatments are available, and what types of side effects might they cause 
How do I take care of my child s needs, such as feeding, bathing and clothing 
What signs or symptoms related to this condition should prompt me to call you 
What signs or symptoms should prompt me to call or my local emergency number 
Do you think my child s symptoms will improve with age 
If I plan to have more children, are they at increased risk of this condition 
How can I find other people who are coping with epidermolysis bullosa 
Have sores developed where bandages and adhesive tape have been applied 
Have you noticed other signs or symptoms in addition to blistering 
Has anyone in your family had a condition marked by significant blistering 
Keeping your child s skin moist with lubricants, such as petroleum jelly 
Call your health care provider immediately if you see signs of infection around a blister 
Your provider also might do a rectal exam to check for prostate enlargement or tenderness 
The sample is checked in the lab for gonorrhea and chlamydia 
Samples of your urine and blood may be sent to the lab for testing, too 
This imaging test uses sound waves to create pictures of your testicles 
Testicular torsion is a twisting of the testicle that can cut off blood flow 
If blood flow is higher than typical, this can help confirm that you have epididymitis 
Treatment Treatment for epididymitis often includes antibiotics and comfort measures 
SurgeryIf an abscess has formed, you might need surgery to drain it 
Sometimes, all or part of the epididymis needs to be removed surgically 
Lifestyle and home remediesEpididymitis often causes a lot of pain 
Key medical Information, including previous STIs or medical conditions and procedures 
All medicines, vitamins, herbs or other supplements you take, including the doses 
The dose is how much of the medicine you take 
How long will it take for me to feel better 
Should any of my partners be tested for an STI 
Do you have discharge from your penis or blood in your semen 
Do you have pain during sex or when you ejaculate 
Have you or any sex partner had or been tested for an STI 
Have you been diagnosed with a prostate condition or urinary tract infection 
This includes oral sex and any skin to skin contact with your genitals 
Oxygen levels that drop too low might need breathing aid 
A numbing medicine applied to the nose can make the test more comfortable 
This might be done in an operating room in case the airway becomes blocked 
With epiglottitis, the X ray may show what looks like a thumbprint in the neck 
Blood cultures can find out whether there s an infection of the blood known as bacteremia 
Treatment Helping a person breathe is the first step in treating epiglottitis 
Helping with breathingMaking sure that you or your child is breathing well might mean 
The tube stays in place until the swelling in the throat goes down 
Putting a needle into the windpipe, known as a needle cricothyroidotomy 
In rare cases, a health care provider creates an emergency airway 
The first medicine may be changed later, depending on what s causing the epiglottitis 
The first health care provider you see might be in an emergency room 
Pediatric neurologist Lily Wong Kisiel, M D , answers the most frequently asked questions about epilepsy 
Depending on the patient, there are absence seizures that are five to six seconds 
Other patients may have generalized tonic clonic seizures which last two to three minutes 
This could be helpful for those subtle seizures that are less detectable by visual inspection 
In those patients, evaluation for surgery can be an option 
How can I be the best partner to my epilepsy team 
First of all, be prepared with your questions when you come to your clinic visits 
To diagnose epilepsy, your healthcare professional reviews your symptoms and medical history 
You may have several tests to diagnose epilepsy and to detect the cause of seizures 
This exam tests your behavior, movements, mental function and other areas 
The exam helps diagnose epilepsy and determine the type of epilepsy you may have 
You also may have brain imaging tests and scans that detect brain changes 
This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy 
If you have epilepsy, it s common to have changes in the pattern of brain waves 
These changes occur even when you re not having a seizure 
The test may be done in a healthcare professional s office or the hospital 
The EEG records seizure activity over the course of a few days at home 
In a variation of an EEG test, you may have a high density EEG 
For this test, electrodes are placed closer together compared with a conventional EEG 
A CT scan uses X rays to obtain cross sectional images of your brain 
But an MRI provides a more detailed look at the brain than a CT scan 
PET scans use a small amount of low dose radioactive material 
Areas of the brain with low metabolism may indicate places where seizures occur 
A SPECT test uses a small amount of low dose radioactive material 
Areas of higher than typical blood flow may indicate areas where seizures occur 
The test overlaps the SPECT results with brain MRI results 
The test results help determine which areas of the brain are affected by seizures 
SPM looks at the areas of the brain with increased blood flow during seizures 
It s compared to the same areas of the brains of people who don t have seizures 
This is done to show areas where seizures are occurring

Many adults can stop taking medicines after two or more years without seizures 
Your healthcare team can advise you about the appropriate time to stop taking medicines 
Finding the right medicine and dosage can be complex 
You may first take a single medicine at a low dose 
Then your healthcare professional may increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well controlled 
There are more than different types of anti seizure medicines available 
For the best seizure control possible with medicine, follow these steps 
This includes medicines you get with or without a prescription and herbal remedies 
Never stop taking your medicine without talking to your healthcare professional 
At least half the people newly diagnosed with epilepsy become seizure free with their first medicine 
When medicines do not provide enough control of seizures, epilepsy surgery may be an option 
With epilepsy surgery, a surgeon removes the area of your brain that s causing seizures 
Your seizures start in a small, well defined area of your brain 
The surgery wouldn t affect vital functions such as speech, language, movement, vision or hearing 
These treatments may be used when open surgery is too risky 
It destroys tissue in an effort to better control the seizures 
You may continue to take medicine to help prevent seizures after successful surgery 
However, you may be able to take fewer medicines and reduce your doses 
In a small number of people, surgery for epilepsy can cause complications 
Deep brain stimulation involves implanting an electrode deep within the brain 
A wire that travels under the skin connects the device to the electrode 
Apart from medicines and surgery, these potential therapies offer an alternative for treating epilepsy 
Wires from the stimulator are connected to the vagus nerve in the neck 
But some people may be able to lower their medicine dose 
The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in the chest 
Deep brain stimulation is often used for people whose seizures don t get better with medicine 
These implantable, pacemaker like devices can help reduce how often seizures occur 
The devices analyze brain activity patterns to detect seizures as they start 
Research shows that this therapy has few side effects and can provide long term seizure relief 
This may be an option when medicines aren t helping to control epilepsy 
It s important for this to be done under close supervision of healthcare professionals 
Experts don t fully know how a ketogenic diet works to reduce seizures 
But researchers think that the diet creates chemical changes that suppress seizures 
The diet also alters the actions of brain cells to reduce seizures 
Get medical advice if you or your child is considering a ketogenic diet 
It s important to make sure that your child gets enough nutrients when following the diet 
These side effects are not common if the diet is properly and medically supervised 
Potential future treatmentsResearchers are studying many potential new treatments for epilepsy, including 
Continuous stimulation of the seizure onset zone, known as subthreshold stimulation 
This area can t be removed because it would affect speech and movements 
Or it might help people with seizure types that may not improve with responsive neurostimulation 
New minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as MRI guided focused ultrasound, show promise for treating seizures 
These surgeries have fewer risks than traditional open brain surgery for epilepsy 
You see, an epileptic seizure is an abnormal electrical disturbance of the brain 
Lifestyle and home remediesUnderstanding your condition can help you take better control of it 
Don t adjust your dosage before talking to a member of your healthcare team 
This will help emergency staff know how to treat you correctly 
Exercising may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression 
Make sure to drink enough water, and rest if you get tired during exercise 
Coping and supportNot being able to control seizures can lead to depression 
But you can live an active, full life with epilepsy 
Educate yourself and your friends and family about epilepsy so that they understand the condition 
If you can t drive because of your seizures, investigate public transportation options near you 
Find a healthcare professional you like and with whom you feel comfortable 
Find an epilepsy support group to meet people who understand what you re going through 
And there are other ways to feel connected to people 
Let people you work and live with know how to handle a seizure 
This can help if they are with you when you have one 
Carefully roll the person onto one side to prevent choking 
Don t place fingers or anything else in the person s mouth 
People with epilepsy will not swallow their tongues during a seizure it s physically impossible 
If immediate medical help is needed, stay with the person until medical staff arrive 
Observe the person closely so that you can provide details on what happened 
Or you may be referred to a neurologist trained in epilepsy, known as an epileptologist 
Appointments can be brief and there s often a lot to talk about 
Here s Information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect 
Seek input from people who may observe your seizures, including family, friends and co workers 
It allows you to record Information you may not know 
You may not be aware of everything that happens when you re having a seizure 
Preparing a list of questions helps you make the most of your appointment time 
What are the alternatives to the primary treatment that you re suggesting 
How can I make sure that I don t hurt myself if I have another seizure 
Do your seizures seem to be triggered by certain events or conditions 
Do you have similar sensations just before the onset of a seizure 
What symptoms do you have when you experience a seizure 
Also, it s important to keep a log of your seizures before your appointment 
To make a diagnosis, a health care professional reviews your symptoms and medical history 
You might need a neurological exam, which will test your 
Brain imaging usually an MRI might reveal the source of frontal lobe seizures 
An MRI involves lying on a narrow table that slides into a long tube 
They can be given a medicine to feel sleepy and less anxious 
This is done by attaching small metal discs called electrodes to the scalp 
This test is usually performed during an overnight stay at a sleep clinic 
Both a video camera and an EEG monitor run all night 
Treatment Over the past decade, treatment options have increased for frontal lobe seizures 
There also are a variety of surgical procedures that might help if medicines don t work 
MedicationsAll anti seizure medicines seem to work equally well at controlling frontal lobe seizures 
You may need to try different types of anti seizure medicines 
Or you may need to take a combination of medicines to control your seizures 
Researchers are continuing to look for new and more effective medicines 
If your seizures can t be controlled with medicines, surgery might be an option 
Before surgery, the goal is to find the areas of the brain where seizures occur 
These include single photon emission computerized tomography SPECT and subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI SISCOM 
Another imaging technique, known as brain mapping, is commonly used before epilepsy surgery 
Brain mapping involves implanting electrodes into an area of the brain 
Then electrical stimulation is used to determine whether that area has an important function 
This helps to rule out surgery on certain areas of the brain 
Functional MRI fMRI , in particular, is used to map the language area of the brain 
But surgery may allow you to take a lower dose 
Sometimes the portion of the brain that s causing seizures is too vital to remove 
This prevents seizures from moving into other parts of the brain 
This procedure usually lowers the number of seizures you have 
A responsive neurostimulator is a newer type of implanted device 
It is activated only when you begin to have a seizure 
This newer procedure involves implanting an electrode into your brain 
The electrode is connected to a stimulating device under the skin of the chest 
Lifestyle and home remediesYou may find that some things trigger seizures 
Seizures can be triggered by alcohol intake, smoking and, especially, lack of sleep 
Avoiding these triggers where possible might help improve seizure control 
Researchers are looking into these therapies to determine their safety and effectiveness 
However, good evidence that they re effective at reducing seizures is mostly still lacking 
Many people with epilepsy use herbs to try to reduce their seizures 
However, there s not enough evidence that most herbs are effective 
Researchers are studying how effective CBD may be for treating other types of seizures 
Herbs can interact with anti seizure medicines, putting your health at risk 
Talk to a health care professional before taking herbal or dietary supplements for your seizures 
Coping and supportSome people who have epilepsy are frustrated by their condition 
Adults with epilepsy can find support through in person and online groups 
Preparing for your appointmentYou re likely to first see a health care professional 
Are there brochures or other printed materials I can have 
What to expect from your doctorYou re likely to be asked questions, such as 
Have you noticed seizure triggers, such as illness or lack of sleep 
X rays of your upper digestive system, also called an esophagram 
Treatment Treatment depends on the frequency and severity of your esophageal spasms 
If your spasms make it difficult to eat or drink, your provider might recommend 
Esophageal spasms are sometimes associated with conditions such as heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD 
Your provider might recommend a proton pump inhibitor to treat GERD 
Sometimes an antidepressant, such as imipramine Tofranil , may be prescribed 
This medicine may help reduce the sensation of pain in the esophagus 
This procedure, called a myotomy, can help weaken esophageal contractions 
Long term studies of this approach aren t available, so myotomy generally isn t recommended for esophageal spasms 
However, it might be considered if other treatments don t work 
This recent technique involves inserting an endoscope through your mouth and down your throat 
This allows a surgeon to make an incision in the inside lining of your esophagus 
Like standard myotomy, POEM is usually considered only if other treatments don t work 
Lifestyle and home remediesTo help you cope with occasional esophageal spasms, try to 
Make a list of foods and beverages that cause your esophageal spasms 
Peppermint oil is a smooth muscle relaxant and might help ease esophageal spasms 
Be aware of any pre appointment restrictions, such as fasting before your appointment 
What types of foods are likely to make my symptoms worse 
Is your chest pain associated with arm or jaw pain, shortness of breath, or nausea 
Are they triggered by any particular food or type of food 
How often you ll have screening tests depends on your condition 
A procedure called upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the preferred method of screening for esophageal varices 
An ultrasound test called transient elastography may be used to measure scarring in the liver 
The primary aim in treating esophageal varices is to prevent bleeding 
If bleeding occurs, treatments are available to try to stop the bleeding 
Beta blocker medicines include propranolol Inderal, Innopran XL and nadolol Corgard 
This essentially strangles the veins so that they can t bleed 
Treatment if you re bleedingBleeding esophageal varices are life threatening, and immediate treatment is essential 
Treatment s used to stop bleeding and reverse the effects of blood loss include 
Your provider may wrap elastic bands around the esophageal varices during an endoscopy 
Taking medicines to slow blood flow into the portal vein 
medicine is usually continued for up to five days after a bleeding episode 
The shunt reduces pressure in the portal vein and often stops bleeding from esophageal varices 
But TIPS can cause serious complications, including liver failure and mental confusion 
Balloon tamponade is a temporary measure before other treatments can be performed, such as TIPS 
This procedure carries a high risk of bleeding recurrence after the balloon is deflated 
Beta blockers and endoscopic band ligation are the recommended treatments to help prevent re bleeding 
After initial banding treatment, your provider typically repeats your upper endoscopy at regular intervals 
The hemostatic powder is given through a catheter during an endoscopy 
When sprayed on the esophagus, hemostatic powder sticks to the varices and may stop bleeding 
However, SEMS could damage tissue and can migrate after being placed 
The stent is typically removed within seven days and bleeding could recur 
Preparing for your appointmentYou might start by seeing your primary health care provider 
Here s some Information to help you get ready for an appointment 
All medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including doses 
Are my symptoms likely to recur, and what can I do to prevent that 
Have you had signs of bleeding, such as blood in your stools or vomit 
Have you had hepatitis or yellowing of your eyes or skin jaundice 
If you drink alcohol, when did you start and how much do you drink 
Using the endoscope, your provider can look for any unusual appearance of the esophagus 
Esophageal spongeThis test can be performed in the health care provider s office 
Barium coats the lining of the esophagus and stomach and makes the organs visible 
Depending on the suspected cause of the disorder, tests may be used to 
Determine the concentration of allergy related white blood cells, called eosinophils 
Identify irregular cells that would indicate esophageal cancer or precancerous changes 
Treatment strategies vary based on the cause of the disorder 
Prescription medicines These include prescription strength H receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors 
This strengthens the sphincter and prevents acid from backing up into the esophagus 
In that position, the ring of beads strengthens the sphincter, preventing acid reflux 
A response to a food allergen is likely the cause of eosinophilic esophagitis 
Therefore, elimination of the culprit food may be an effective treatment strategy 
Taking an alternative medicine that is less likely to cause drug induced esophagitis 
Taking a liquid version of a medicine if possible 
Sitting or standing for at least minutes after taking a pill 
Treating common complicationsA gastroenterologist may perform a procedure to expand, or dilate, the esophagus 
In esophageal dilation, your provider uses one or more endoscopic devices 
A tapered tip that starts with a rounded point that gradually widens 
A balloon that can be expanded after it s inserted in the esophagus 
Eating or drinking large amounts of certain foods may worsen your symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux 
Don t lie down for at least minutes after taking a pill 
Talk to your provider if you need help ending a smoking habit 
Try not to stoop or bend, especially soon after eating 
Wait at least three hours after eating to lie down or go to bed 
Aim for an elevation of to inches to centimeters 
Alternative medicine No alternative medicine therapies have been proved to treat esophagitis 
What you can doMake a list ahead of time, including 
Symptoms you re experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to pain, difficulty swallowing or reflux 
Family history of allergies and disorders of the esophagus or stomach 
If you think you have symptoms of esophagitis, you may ask some of the following 
How long will it take to find out the results of tests 
What steps can I take on my own to prevent symptoms from happening again 
Does anything seem to prompt or worsen symptoms, such as certain foods 
Does anything lessen symptoms, such as taking nonprescription antacids or not eating certain foods 
Do you have any allergies, and do you take any allergy medicine 
Have you ever had food get stuck in your throat after swallowing 
Do you ever have food come back up after swallowing 
If possible, limit the use of nonprescription medications that could be causing problems 
When you take pills, drink a glass of water and don t lie down immediately afterward 
To do this, your health care provider may suggest the following tests 
Laboratory testsBlood and urine may be tested for several factors, including 
One test used to evaluate essential tremor involves drawing a spiral 
The spiral on the left was drawn by someone affected by essential tremor 
The spiral on the right was drawn by a person not affected by essential tremor 
To evaluate the tremor itself, your health care provider may ask you to 
This scan can help the provider tell the difference between the two types of tremor 
Treatment Some people with essential tremor don t require treatment if their symptoms are mild 
Beta blockers may not be an option for people with asthma or certain heart problems 
Anti seizure medicines Primidone Mysoline may be effective in people who don t respond to beta blockers 
Side effects include drowsiness and nausea, which usually disappear within a short time 
These medicines should be used with caution because they can be habit forming 
Botox injections can improve tremors for up to three months at a time 
Physical therapists can teach you exercises to improve your muscle strength, control and coordination 
Occupational therapists can help you adapt to living with essential tremor 
Studies have found that the device can bring some improvement for tremors 
This is the most common type of surgery for essential tremor 
It s generally the preferred procedure in medical centers with significant experience in performing this surgery 
Side effects often go away after some time or adjustment of the device 
This noninvasive surgery involves using focused sound waves that travel through the skin and skull 
Focused ultrasound thalamotomy is done on one side of the brain 
The surgery affects the other side of the body from the one where it s done 
Focused ultrasound thalamotomy creates a sore that can result in permanent changes to brain function 
Some people have experienced altered sensation, trouble with walking or difficulty with movement 
Tremors tend to worsen once the effects of alcohol wear off 
Try voice activated commands on your smartphone and speech recognition software on your computer 
Coping and supportFor many people, essential tremor can have serious social and psychological consequences 
For essential tremor, some questions to ask your health care provider include 
A doctor may put a thin, flexible tube, known as an endoscope, into the nose 
Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of the body 
Removing a sample of tissue for testing, also called a biopsy 
This procedure can often be done in the doctor s office 
Treatment Esthesioneuroblastoma treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer 
Treatment for esthesioneuroblastoma usually involves a team of experts with different specialties 
Surgeons who operate on the nervous system, known as neurosurgeons 
Doctors who use radiation to treat cancer, known as a radiation oncologists 
Doctors who use medicine to treat cancer, known as medical oncologists 
SurgeryThe type of surgery depends on where the tumor is and how large it is 
Removing the part of the tumor that s in the nose 
This is usually done using a thin, flexible tube, known as an endoscope 
The tube has a camera that lets the surgeon see the cancer 
Special surgical tools passed through the endoscope help with removing the cancer and nearby tissue 
Opening the skull to get to the tumor, known as a craniotomy 
That allows the surgeon to remove the tumor from the brain 
Surgery complications might include spinal fluid leaking into the nose, infection and vision problems 
If surgery isn t possible, radiation therapy can be used alone or with chemotherapy 
Alternative medicine No alternative medicine treatments can cure esthesioneuroblastoma 
With time, you ll find good ways to cope with your diagnosis 
Ask where to find good sources of Information about treatments 
Knowing more might help you feel better about making treatment decisions 
Talking with others going through what you re going through might help 
Your friends and family can provide much needed support during your cancer treatment 
When you tell people about your esthesioneuroblastoma diagnosis, you ll likely get many offers for help

You may be asked to keep a diary to track days with and without bleeding 
A sample of your blood may be tested for iron deficiency anemia 
Your doctor may take a tissue sample from the inside of your uterus

Other medicines Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists and antagonists are also called GnRH medicines 
Relugolix combined with an estrogen and progestin Myfembree may help control bleeding caused by fibroids 
Elagolix with an estrogen and progestin Oriahnn is used to treat fibroid related bleeding 
Elagolix alone Orilissa may help control bleeding caused by endometriosis 
ProceduresYou may need surgery for heavy menstrual bleeding if medicines do not help 
Dilation and curettage, also called a D C In this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix 
The doctor then scrapes or suctions tissue from the lining of your uterus 
You may have a D C to find the source of abnormal uterine bleeding 
Causes of bleeding may include polyps, fibroids or cancer of the uterus 
If you ve had a miscarriage, you may need a D C to completely empty the uterus 
The goal of this procedure is to block blood flow to uterine fibroids 
During the procedure, the surgeon passes a catheter through the large artery in the thigh 
This procedure shrinks fibroids by targeting and destroying fibroids through ultrasound waves and radiofrequency energy 
The process of destroying tissue also is known as ablation 
Pregnancy after endometrial ablation isn t likely but is possible and could be dangerous 
Using reliable or permanent birth control until menopause is recommended 
The surgeon uses an electrosurgical wire loop to remove the lining of the uterus 
It ends menstrual periods and the ability to get pregnant

Diagnosis You might first notice a fibroadenoma when you bathe or shower 
Or you may notice it while you do a breast self exam 
Which tests you need depends on your age and the features of the breast lump 
Breast ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the breast 
Ultrasound clearly shows the size and shape of a fibroadenoma 
Nothing needs to go inside your body for this test 
Mammography uses X rays to make an image of breast tissue 
It detects the borders of a fibroadenoma and sets it apart from other tissues 
A common biopsy method for a fibroadenoma is a core needle biopsy 
A doctor called a radiologist usually performs a core needle biopsy 
An ultrasound device helps the doctor guide the needle to the right spot 
A special, hollow needle collects a tiny sample of breast tissue 
A lab exam of the sample can reveal what kind of lump is present 
This might also happen if the biopsy results are not clear 
But, in some cases, you may need surgery to remove a fast growing fibroadenoma 
In between visits, let your provider know if you notice any changes in your breasts 
You may also need surgery if the fibroadenoma is large, grows quickly or causes symptoms

Are there changes in the breast lump before or after your period 
The radiologist closely examines the area of concern when interpreting the mammogram 
If you re younger than age , you might have an ultrasound instead of a mammogram 
Ultrasound can also help your doctor distinguish between fluid filled cysts and solid masses 
A fine needle aspiration may collapse the cyst and resolve discomfort 
You may need a diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound to evaluate the changes 
Severe pain or large, painful cysts associated with fibrocystic breasts may warrant treatment 
Your doctor uses a hair thin needle to drain the fluid from the cyst 
Oral contraceptives, which lower the levels of cycle related hormones linked to fibrocystic breast changes 
Wear a firm support bra, fitted by a professional, if possible 
Eat less fat, which may decrease breast pain or discomfort associated with fibrocystic breasts

Treatment There s no single best treatment for uterine fibroids 
If you have symptoms, talk with your care team about ways to get relief 
Or they have mildly annoying symptoms that they can live with 
If that s the case for you, watchful waiting could be the best option 
medicinesmedicines for uterine fibroids target hormones that control the menstrual cycle 
They treat symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pressure 
They don t get rid of fibroids, but they may shrink them 
These treat fibroids by blocking the body from making the hormones estrogen and progesterone 
As a result, menstrual periods stop, fibroids shrink and anemia often gets better 
GnRH agonists include leuprolide Lupron Depot, Eligard, others , goserelin Zoladex and triptorelin Trelstar, Triptodur Kit 
Often, these medicines are used for no more than six months 
Sometimes, GnRH agonists are taken with low dose estrogen or progestin 
Or you might be prescribed this medicine to help transition you into menopause

Done while you re inside an MRI scanner equipped with a high energy ultrasound device for treatment 
The images give your doctor the precise location of the uterine fibroids 
Newer technology, so researchers are learning more about the long term safety and effectiveness 
Small particles called embolic agents are injected into the uterine artery through a small catheter 
During laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation, the doctor sees inside the abdomen using two special instruments 
The other is a laparoscopic ultrasound wand that sits directly on the uterus 
Using both instruments provides the doctor with two views of a uterine fibroid 
This allows for more thorough treatment than would be possible with just one view 
They re linked with faster recovery times and fewer complications compared with traditional open surgery 
The particles cut off blood flow to fibroids, causing them to shrink and die 
This technique can help shrink fibroids and relieve the symptoms they cause 
Complications may happen if the blood supply to your ovaries or other organs is reduced 
But research shows that complications are similar to surgical fibroid treatments 
And the risk of needing a blood transfusion is lower 
With laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation, your doctor makes two small cuts in the abdomen 
Using the camera and an ultrasound tool, your doctor finds fibroids to be treated 
The needles heat up the fibroid tissue and destroy it 
Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation is also known as the Acessa procedure or Lap RFA 
Most people who have the procedure get back to regular activities within a few days 
The transcervical or through the cervix approach to radiofrequency ablation is called Sonata 
In a myomectomy, your surgeon removes the fibroids and leaves the uterus in place 
Sometimes, a robotic system is used for the laparoscopic procedure 
Robotic myomectomy gives your surgeon a magnified, D view of your uterus 
This can make the procedure more precise than is possible using some other techniques 
Or it can be done by extending one incision to remove the fibroids without morcellation 
The fibroids are removed using tools placed through the vagina and cervix into the uterus 
This destroys the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus 
Traditional surgical proceduresOptions for traditional open surgeries that use a larger incision include 
It remains the only proven permanent solution for uterine fibroids 
If you also decide to have your ovaries removed, the surgery brings on menopause 
Most people with uterine fibroids may be able to choose to keep their ovaries 
Morcellation during fibroid removalMorcellation is a process of breaking fibroids into smaller pieces 
The surgical team looks into a person s risk factors before surgery 
The fibroid is broken up in a surgical bag during morcellation 
The incision is expanded to remove a large fibroid without morcellation 
All myomectomies carry the risk of cutting into cancer that hasn t been found 
Older people who are in or entering menopause may have a higher cancer risk 
And people who no longer want to get pregnant have other treatment options for fibroids 
Alternative medicinesome websites and health books promote alternative treatments for uterine fibroids 
These include specific diet recommendations, magnet therapy, black cohosh, herbal preparations or homeopathy 
So far, there s no scientific evidence to show that any of these techniques help 
With this technique, a practitioner places very thin needles into certain points on the body 
Appointments can be brief, so it s a good idea to prepare for your visit 
Include the amounts you take, called the doses, and how often you take them 
Use it to note key Information during your visit 
List your most important questions first, to be sure that you cover those points 
What medicines are available to treat uterine fibroids or my symptoms 
What side effects can I expect from medicine use 
Will I need to take medicine before or after surgery

The tube is moved until it reaches the area being examined 
Then, X rays are used to create pictures of the arteries 
The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on the X ray images 
This test is done using a computerized tomography CT machine 
It can show narrowing in the arteries, aneurysms and dissections 
You lie on a narrow table, which slides through a doughnut shaped scanner 
Before the test starts, dye called contrast is given into a vein 
This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of the body 
It can see if you have an aneurysm or artery tear 
Before the test starts, you might be given dye into a vein 
The dye, called contrast, helps blood vessels show up more clearly on the test images 
Treatment Treatment for fibromuscular dysplasia depends on 
Any other health conditions you have, such as high blood pressure 
Other treatments may include medicines and procedures to open or repair an artery 
Examples include candesartan Atacand , irbesartan Avapro , losartan Cozaar and valsartan Diovan 
Sometimes called water pills, these medicines help remove excess fluid from the body 
A diuretic is sometimes used with other blood pressure medicines 
Hydrochlorothiazide Microzide is an example of this type of medicine 
Beta blockers, such as metoprolol Lopressor, Toprol XL , atenolol Tenormin and others, slow the heartbeat 
Some medicines used to treat high blood pressure can affect the way the kidneys work

The tissue sample may be obtained in one of these ways 
The solution that s withdrawn contains cells from your air sacs 
Some treatments may improve symptoms temporarily or slow the disease s progress 
MedicationsIntense research to identify treatment options for specific types of interstitial lung disease is ongoing

More tests may be needed to find out why you are short of breath 
An echocardiogram uses sound waves to look at the heart 
It also can create videos that show how the heart is working 
The percentage of oxygen in the blood is called oxygen saturation 
The oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the sample are measured 
One of these methods can be used to get a tissue sample 
This procedure may be done as a minimally invasive surgery called video assisted thoracoscopic surgery VATS 
The biopsy also may be done as an open surgery called a thoracotomy 
The tissue samples are sometimes too small to make the right diagnosis 
But this form of biopsy also may be used to rule out other conditions 
Blood testsYou may have blood tests to look at your liver and kidney function 
Blood tests also can check for and rule out other conditions

Rarely, a full thickness cornea transplant, known as penetrating keratoplasty PK , may be recommended 
Various eyedrop treatments are being developed and may enter clinical trials in the future 
Novel surgical treatments also are being studied to determine if they may be of benefit 
Apply over the counter nonprescription salt solution sodium chloride eyedrops or ointment 
This helps remove excess fluid in the cornea, which decreases swelling 
In some cases, you might be referred to an ophthalmologist who specializes in corneal disease 
All medications, vitamins or other supplements you take and dose

It can show real time images of how well the heart and its valves are working 
The images are produced by transmitting sound waves via a wand pressed against the chest 
More Information Pectus excavatum care at Chest X raysCT scanEchocardiogramElectrocardiogram ECG or EKG Stress testShow more related Information 
People who have mild signs and symptoms may be helped by physical therapy 
Certain exercises can improve posture and increase the degree to which the chest can expand 
This minimally invasive procedure uses small incisions placed on each side of the chest 
Long handled tools and a narrow fiber optic camera are inserted through the incisions 
This older procedure involves a much larger incision down the center of the chest 
There are many options for pain control after surgery to help improve recovery 
Adults have either had to live with it or face major more complicated operations 
We re doing a repair of a deformity of the chest wall, called a pectus excavatum 
Dr Dawn Jaroszewski is a thoracic surgeon, who specializes in pectus repair 
And now, we re finding out that people can have very severe heart and lung problems 
A couple of years ago, I developed a little bit of a wheezey cough 
Michelle Kroeger had a mild case of pectus that got worse over time 
And then I was getting more palpitations in my heart, chest pain 
You can see here this very narrow space between her spine here and her chest 
The concave chest was compressing Michelle s lung, and it shifted her heart to the left 
Traditional surgery for adults means major surgery, opening the chest, and remodeling the chest wall 
First, Dr Jaroszewski makes small incisions on either side of the patient 
This is an x ray, which shows an adult two bars and a nice repair 
When they come out her chest will retain its new shape 
Michelle says she got relief from symptoms almost immediately after surgery 
Coping and supportMost adolescents just want to fit in and look like their peers 
This can be exceptionally difficult for youngsters who have pectus excavatum 
In some cases, counseling may be needed to help master coping skills

The endoscope passes down the throat, into the esophagus, stomach and small intestine 
Using the endoscope, your healthcare professional looks for signs of inflammation 
A biopsy also can identify the presence of H pylori in your stomach lining 
You may have to swallow a white, metallic liquid that contains barium 
The liquid coats your digestive tract and makes an ulcer more visible

A fiber optic endoscope has a light and tiny camera at the end 
The images are viewed on a video monitor in the exam room 
Treatment Treatment of gastritis depends on the specific cause 
Be sure to take the full antibiotic prescription, usually for to days 
You also may take a medicine to block acid production 
They do this by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid 
Ask your healthcare professional whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk 
Your healthcare professional may include an antacid in your treatment 
Antacids neutralize existing stomach acid and can provide rapid pain relief 
These help with immediate symptom relief but are generally not used as a primary treatment 
Side effects of antacids can include constipation or diarrhea, depending on the main ingredients 
Proton pump inhibitors and acid blockers are more effective and have fewer side effects

Has hepatitis B damaged my liver or caused other complications, such as kidney problems 
How can I prevent people around me from hepatitis B 
Have you ever developed jaundice symptoms, including yellowing of the eyes or clay colored stool 
If a screening test shows hepatitis C, other blood tests can 
Measure the quantity of the hepatitis C virus in the blood, called the viral load 
This noninvasive imaging can be done instead of a liver biopsy 
This makes a map that shows places where the liver is stiff 
Stiff liver tissue means scarring of the liver, called fibrosis 
The test measures how fast the vibrations go through liver tissue 
A series of blood tests can show the amount of scarring in the liver 
A member of the care team does transient elastography to find liver damage 
This sometimes can be done instead of a liver biopsy

Treatment with direct acting antiviral medicines usually lasts weeks 
Due to the pace of research, treatments are changing quickly 
So it s best to discuss treatment choices with a specialist 
A small number come from living donors who donate a part of their livers 
In most cases, a liver transplant alone doesn t cure hepatitis C 
This means more treatment with antiviral medicines to prevent damage to the new liver

The pictures can show the size and location of the cancer 
How the cells are collected depends on the cancer s location 
Special tools can collect cells from inside the throat or inside the nose 
For instance, the cells might be tested for signs of HPV infection 
Your healthcare team uses this Information to make a treatment plan 
Treatment Head and neck cancer treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer 
SurgeryWhen possible, surgeons use cutting tools to cut out all of the cancer

The way your ear is formed might cause hearing problems, as well 
You can use a mobile app on your tablet to screen yourself for hearing loss 
Tuning forks are two pronged, metal instruments that make sounds when hit 
Simple tests with tuning forks can help find hearing loss 
A specialist in hearing loss, known as an audiologist, does these more thorough tests 
Sounds and words are directed through earphones to each ear 
Each tone is repeated at low levels to find the quietest sound you can hear 
Some hearing aids also have a volume control or a program button 
A cochlear implant uses a sound processor that s worn behind the ear 
A transmitter sends sound signals to a receiver and stimulator implanted under the skin 
They stimulate the auditory nerve with electrodes that have been threaded into the cochlea 
Others have these as separate outside parts upper left and on right 
Earwax blockage is a cause of hearing loss that can be fixed 
Some types of hearing loss can be treated with surgery 
Dr Hogan So there isn t one best hearing aid for older people versus younger people 
We try to choose a hearing aid that s going to fit the person s needs 
Some hearing aids can even connect to a person s cellphone 
More Information Hearing loss care at Hearing aids How to choose the right one 
Coping and supportThese tips can help you stay connected with hearing loss

Blood and imaging tests may be done to check your heart health 
It shows how blood flows through the heart and the health of the heart valves 
The type you have depends on the reason for the test and your overall health 
This quick test records the electrical signals in the heart 
Sensors, called electrodes, are attached to the chest and sometimes the legs 
Wires connect the sensors to a computer, which displays or prints results 
Fluid could be due to some types of heart valve disease 
It can help determine the severity of heart valve disease 
This test isn t often used to diagnose heart valve disease 
But it may be done if other tests can t diagnose a heart valve problem 
Or it might be used to tell how severe heart valve disease is 
Dye flows through the catheter into the arteries in the heart 
MedicationsSome people with heart valve disease need medicines to treat their symptoms 
Blood thinners may be given to help prevent blood clots 
Methods to repair or replace heart valves include open heart surgery or minimally invasive heart surgery 
Surgeons at some medical centers may do robot assisted heart valve surgery 
, your health care team might suggest surgery to repair and save your heart valve 
Repair the structure of the valve by replacing torn or ruptured cords that support it 
Remove excess valve tissue so that the valve can close tightly 
Reduce the outer size of the valve so the flaps can better contact each other 
A surgeon tightens or reinforces the outer ring around the valve 
This surgery may be done with other treatments to repair a heart valve 
This surgery is used to repair the flaps of the valve 
The surgeon guides the tube to the affected heart valve 
The balloon is deflated, and the tube and balloon are removed 
Sometimes clips or plugs are passed through the tube to repair the heart valve 
If a heart valve can t be repaired, surgery may be done to replace it 
The most commonly replaced valves are the mitral and aortic valves 
A surgeon removes the damaged heart valve and replaces it with one of the following 
This type of artificial heart valve is made of strong material 
This type of artificial heart valve is made from cow, pig or human heart tissue 
Biological tissue valves break down over time and eventually need to be replaced 
Sometimes, the aortic valve is replaced with the person s own pulmonary valve 
Then the pulmonary valve is replaced with a biological valve 
But less invasive procedures may be available, depending on which heart valve is affected 
Talk to your health care team before starting a new exercise routine 
If you need help quitting, talk to a health care professional 
PregnancyCareful and regular checkups are needed for those who have heart valve disease during pregnancy 
For heart valve disease, some basic questions to ask your care team include 
What is the likely cause of my symptoms or condition 
What are the options to the main treatment that you re suggesting 
Are there any activity, sports or diet restrictions I need to follow 
If I need heart valve surgery, which surgeon do you recommend 
A urine test, to check the concentration and makeup of your urine 
This test can also check your kidney function, which can be affected by heatstroke 
Muscle function tests, to check for rhabdomyolysis serious damage to your muscle tissue 
X rays and other imaging, to check for damage to your inner organs 
In most cases, you can treat heat exhaustion yourself by doing the following 
Rest on your back with your legs raised higher than your heart level 
Don t drink any alcoholic beverages, which can add to dehydration 
Remove any unnecessary clothing and make sure your clothes are lightweight and nonbinding 
Cool water is misted on your body while warm air is fanned over you 
This causes the water to evaporate and cool your skin 
Muscle function tests to check for serious damage to your muscle tissue rhabdomyolysis 
X rays and other imaging tests to check for damage to your internal organs 
If you have signs or symptoms of heatstroke, seek emergency medical help 
Others should take steps to cool you off while waiting for emergency help to arrive 
These drinks may interfere with your body s ability to control your temperature 
Diagnosis Plantar fasciitis is diagnosed based on your medical history and physical exam 
The location of your pain can help determine its cause 
Sometimes an X ray shows a piece of bone sticking out from the heel bone 
In the past, these bone spurs were often blamed for heel pain and removed surgically 
But many people who have bone spurs on their heels have no heel pain 
Injecting steroid medicine into the tender area can provide temporary pain relief 
Ultrasound imaging during injections can assist in precise needle placement 
Sound waves are directed at the area of heel pain to stimulate healing 
This is for chronic plantar fasciitis that hasn t responded to more conservative treatments 
Some studies show promising results, though this therapy hasn t been shown to be consistently effective 
Few people need surgery to detach the plantar fascia from the heel bone 
Lifestyle and home remediesTo reduce the pain of plantar fasciitis, try these self care tips 
Extra weight can put extra stress on your plantar fascia 
Replace your old athletic shoes before they stop supporting and cushioning your feet 
Try a low impact sport, such as swimming or bicycling, instead of walking or jogging 
Or try rolling a frozen bottle of water under your foot for an ice massage 
Simple home exercises can stretch your plantar fascia, Achilles tendon and calf muscles 
For plantar fasciitis, basic questions to ask your health care team include 
Are there other treatment options than the one you re suggesting 
Do your symptoms tend to occur at a specific time of day 
Are you a runner, or do you take part in any sports that involve running 
In most cases, a health care provider can diagnose a hemangioma by looking at it 
Treatment typically needs to continue until about to years of age 
Side effects can include high blood sugar, low blood pressure and wheezing 
If beta blocker treatments don t work for a child, corticosteroids may be an option 
They can be given as a shot or applied to the skin 
Side effects can include poor growth and thinning of the skin 
Sometimes laser surgery can remove a small, thin hemangioma or treat sores on a hemangioma 
If you re considering treatment for your child s hemangioma, talk with your child s health care provider 
Show transcript for video Infantile hemangiomas also known as strawberry birthmarks 
We estimate that approximately one in twenty children are born with a hemangioma 
Someone who really specializes in taking care of these birthmarks 
This is actually a really exciting time for infantile hemangiomas 
Laser treatment as another treatment that we do sometimes do for infantile hemangiomas 
Imaging techniques are the best ways to determine the position and size of a hematoma 
CT is the most commonly used imaging scan to diagnose intracranial hematomas 
This is done using magnetic field and radio waves to make computerized images 
During an MRI scan, you lie on a movable table that s guided into a tube 
However, signs and symptoms can appear or worsen days or weeks after the injury 
Options for reversing blood thinners include giving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma 
The type of surgery depends on the type of hematoma you have 
Coping and supportPatience is important for coping with brain injuries 
Adults will have the majority of their recovery during the first six months 
Then you might have smaller, more gradual improvements for up to two years after the hematoma 
Get enough sleep at night, and rest in the daytime when you feel tired 
Ease back into your normal activities when you feel stronger 
Don t participate in contact and recreational sports until you get your doctor s OK 
Your reaction times likely will have slowed as a result of your brain injury 
MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the head 
Diagnosing hemifacial spasm doesn t always need an MRI scan or other imaging test 
Imaging tests might be for people whose symptoms aren t typical or who are having surgery 
Treatment Treatment for hemifacial spasm may include 
Other medicines Some medicines, including anticonvulsant drugs, can relieve hemifacial spasm in some people 
There are several types of surgery that can help relieve hemifacial spasm 
This exposes the facial nerve where it leaves the brainstem 
A surgeon then finds the blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve 
Putting a spongelike material between the nerve and blood vessel eases pressure on the nerve 
It also may be revealed when screening family members of people diagnosed with the disease 
Blood testsThe two key tests to detect iron overload are 
Transferrin saturation values greater than are considered too high 
This test measures the amount of iron stored in your liver 
These blood tests for iron are best performed after you have been fasting 
Elevations in one or all of these tests can be found in other disorders 
You may need to have the tests repeated for the most accurate results 
If your provider suspects liver damage, the provider may order a liver biopsy 
The sample goes to a lab to be checked for the presence of iron 
The lab also looks for evidence of liver damage, especially scarring or cirrhosis 
More Information Genetic testingLiver function testsMRINeedle biopsyShow more related Information 
The goal of phlebotomy is to lower your iron levels 
The blood flows from the needle into a tube that s attached to a blood bag 
The process of removing blood is referred to as therapeutic blood removal 
Some people may maintain typical iron levels without having any blood taken 
The schedule depends on how quickly iron builds up in your body 
Treating hemochromatosis can help relieve symptoms of tiredness, stomach pain and skin darkening 
It can help prevent serious complications such as liver disease, heart disease and diabetes 
Phlebotomy can t reverse cirrhosis or joint pain, but it can slow the progression 
If you have cirrhosis, your health care provider may recommend occasional screening for liver cancer 
Instead, your provider may recommend a medicine to remove excess iron 
There s usually no need to restrict vitamin C in your diet, however 
Alcohol greatly increases the risk of liver damage in people with hemochromatosis 
If you have hemochromatosis and you already have liver disease, avoid alcohol completely 
Additional dietary changes generally aren t required for people receiving blood removal treatment 
Take a family member or friend along to help you remember what s been discussed 
Questions to ask your doctorSome basic questions to ask include 
Is my condition temporary, or will I always have it 
How many alcoholic beverages do you drink in a week 
Do you have a history of viral hepatitis, such as hepatitis C 
Diagnosis A physical exam and lab tests can confirm a diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome 
These tests can show if the red blood cells are damaged 
This test might find E coli and other bacteria in stool 
Treatment Hemolytic uremic syndrome needs treatment in the hospital 
Platelets can help blood clot better in people who are bleeding or bruising easily 
This medicine might prevent or slow more kidney damage 
Dialysis is often done only until the kidneys begin working well again 
But people with a lot of kidney damage might need long term dialysis 
Plasma is the fluid part of blood that helps blood cells and platelets circulate 
Some people who have severe kidney damage from hemolytic uremic syndrome need a kidney transplant 
Have you or your child had a fever, swelling or decreased urine output 
How long have you or your child been having these symptoms 
How long has it been since you or your child urinated 
Diagnosis Severe cases of hemophilia usually are diagnosed within the first year of life 
Some people learn they have hemophilia after they bleed excessively during a surgical procedure 
Clotting factor tests can reveal a clotting factor deficiency and determine how severe the hemophilia is 
It s also possible to determine during pregnancy if the fetus is affected by hemophilia 
Discuss the benefits and risks of testing with your doctor 
This replacement therapy can be given to treat a bleeding episode in progress 
Similar products, called recombinant clotting factors, are made in a laboratory, not from human blood 
It can be injected slowly into a vein or used as a nasal spray 
This is a newer drug that doesn t include clotting factors 
This drug can help prevent bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia A 
Also known as anti fibrinolytics, these medications help prevent clots from breaking down 
These can be applied directly to wound sites to promote clotting and healing 
It can ease signs and symptoms if internal bleeding has damaged your joints 
Using pressure and a bandage will generally take care of the bleeding 
For small areas of bleeding beneath the skin, use an ice pack 
Ice pops can be used to slow down minor bleeding in the mouth 
Lifestyle and home remediesTo avoid excessive bleeding and protect your joints 
Activities such as swimming, bicycle riding and walking can build muscles while protecting joints 
Drugs that can make bleeding worse include aspirin and ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others 
Instead, use acetaminophen Tylenol, others , which is a safer alternative for mild pain relief 
The goal is to prevent tooth and gum disease, which can lead to excessive bleeding 
Coping and supportTo help you and your child cope with hemophilia 
If your child plays noncontact sports, be sure to tell coaches, too 
Key medical Information, including other conditions, and a family history of bleeding disorders 
What s the most likely cause of these signs and symptoms 
If you or your child has had surgery, did the surgeon mention excessive bleeding 
Are you or your child prone to developing large, deep bruises 
Do you or your child have pain or warmth around joints 
Diagnosis Your health care provider might be able to see external hemorrhoids 
Diagnosing internal hemorrhoids might include an exam of your anal canal and rectum 
Your health care provider inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum 
This allows your provider to check for anything unusual, such as growths 
Internal hemorrhoids are often too soft to be felt during a rectal exam 
Your health care provider might want to look at your entire colon using colonoscopy if 
Your symptoms suggest you might have another digestive system disease 
You are middle aged and haven t had a recent colonoscopy 
This helps softens the stool and increases its bulk, which will help you avoid straining 
Add fiber to your diet slowly to avoid problems with gas 
Apply a hemorrhoid cream or suppository containing hydrocortisone that you can buy without a prescription 
You also can use pads containing witch hazel or a numbing medicine 
With these treatments, hemorrhoid symptoms often go away within a week 
See your health care provider within a week if you don t get relief 
Contact your provider sooner if you have severe pain or bleeding 
Ask your health care provider how long you should use it 
Sliding the ligator cylinder upward releases rubber bands around the base of the hemorrhoid 
These treatments can be done in your provider s office or another outpatient setting 
The bleeding might begin to days after the procedure but is rarely severe 
They cause small, bleeding internal hemorrhoids to harden and shrivel 
Coagulation has few side effects and usually causes little discomfort 
Surgical proceduresOnly a small percentage of people with hemorrhoids need surgery to remove them 
Your surgeon removes extra tissue that causes bleeding by using one of various techniques 
Hemorrhoidectomy is the most effective and complete way to treat severe or recurring hemorrhoids 
Most people have some pain after the procedure, which medicines can relieve 
This procedure, called stapled hemorrhoidopexy, blocks blood flow to hemorrhoidal tissue 
Rectal prolapse is when part of the rectum pushes through the anus 
Complications also can include bleeding, troubles emptying the bladder and pain 
A rare complication is a life threatening blood infection called sepsis 
Talk with your health care provider about the best option for you 
Here are some suggestions to help you get ready for your appointment 
Key personal Information, including typical bowel habits and diet, especially your fiber intake 
If treatments we try first don t work, what will you recommend next

Drinking to glasses of water a day also might help relieve your symptoms 
Diagnosis If a screening test shows hepatitis C, other blood tests can 
Your doctor will likely perform a physical exam and take a medical history 
Your doctor may order blood tests that look for high levels of certain liver enzymes 
These enzyme levels can show how well your liver is functioning 
Additional imaging tests may include magnetic elastography and transient elastography 
Treatment Doctors will work to determine what s causing your liver damage 
The sooner this medication is administered, the greater the chance of limiting liver damage 
It s most effective if administered within hours of the acetaminophen overdose 
For people who overdose on a toxic medication, emergency care is essential 
Most livers used in liver transplants come from deceased donors 
For toxic hepatitis, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Could one of the medications I m taking be responsible for the damage to my liver 
Will these conditions or their treatment affect the outcome of toxic hepatitis 
Have you noticed yellowing in the whites of your eyes 
Does anyone in your family have a history of liver disease 
Doctors rely on symptoms and test results to make the diagnosis 
They can check the level of copper in your blood too 
These rings are caused by extra copper in the eyes 
Wilson s disease also is related to a type of cataract, called a sunflower cataract 
Removing a sample of liver tissue for testing, also known as a biopsy 
A blood test can pinpoint the genetic changes that cause Wilson s disease 
If any have the changed gene, that sibling can start treatment before symptoms begin 
More Information Wilson s disease care at CT scanGenetic testingLiver biopsyLiver function testsMRIShow 
Treatment Your doctor might recommend medicines called copper chelating agents 
Your kidneys then filter the copper and release it into your urine 
Treatment then focuses on stopping copper from building up again 
For severe liver damage, a liver transplant might be needed 
medicinesIf you take medicines for Wilson s disease, treatment is lifelong 
That means you ll need to take a B supplement in small doses 
Still, nervous system symptoms can get worse when taking trientine 
This medicine stops your body from absorbing copper from the food you eat 
Your doctor also might recommend ways to treat other symptoms of Wilson s disease 
If your liver damage is serious, you might need a liver transplant 
Sometimes a liver can come from a living donor, such as a family member 
Be sure to stay away from multivitamins that contain copper 
Preparing for your appointmentYou ll likely first see your family doctor 
Do I need to limit the types of food I eat 
Do your symptoms occur all the time or only once in a while 
What, if anything, seems to make your symptoms better or worse 
These tests can help find if you have hepatopulmonary syndrome 
A liver transplant is the only cure for hepatopulmonary syndrome 
But some symptoms may not yet be apparent in children or young adults 
Imaging testsIn HHT, abnormal connections called arteriovenous malformations AVMs develop between arteries and veins 
The organs most commonly affected by HHT are the lungs, brain and liver 
To locate AVMs, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following imaging tests 
This technique is sometimes used to determine whether the liver is affected by AVMs 
Because the disorder is uncommon, finding a specialist in HHT can be difficult 
Anti estrogens such as tamoxifen Soltamox and raloxifene Evista also have been used to control HHT 
Other drugs that block blood vessel growth are being studied for HHT treatment 
Procedures to reduce the frequency and severity of nosebleeds may include 
However, this is typically a temporary solution and the nosebleeds eventually recur 
This is done only in extreme cases when other approaches have failed 
The location of the AVM, particularly in the brain, can increase the surgical risks 
Rarely, treatment for AVMs in the liver is a liver transplant 
Lifestyle and home remediesTo help prevent HHT nosebleeds, you may want to 
Applying saline sprays and moisturizing ointments can help reduce the risk of bleeding 
Diagnosis Diagnosing Lynch syndrome might start with a review of your family history of cancer 
This may lead to other tests and procedures to diagnose Lynch syndrome 
Multiple relatives with any Lynch associated cancers, including colon cancer and endometrial cancer 
One or more family members who had cancer before age 
One or more family members who have had more than one type of cancer 
More than one generation of family with the same type of cancer 
The presence or absence of staining shows whether the tissue has certain proteins 
Missing proteins might help determine if the genes related to Lynch syndrome caused the cancer 
In people with Lynch syndrome, there may be errors or instability in these pieces 
But the results can t say for certain whether you have Lynch syndrome 
Some people have these genetic changes only in their cancer cells 
Genetic testing is needed to see if all the cells have these genes 
Genetic testingGenetic testing looks for changes in the genes that cause Lynch syndrome 
You may give a sample of your blood for this test 
A genetics professional can help decide which test is best for you 
Your personal risk of cancer depends on which genes run in your family 
You can lower your risk with tests to look for signs of cancer 
Some treatments can help lower your risk of certain cancers 
A genetics professional can explain your individual risk to you based on your results 
A negative result means gene changes that cause Lynch syndrome weren t found in your cells 
But you could still have an increased risk of cancer 
Genetic tests don t always give you a yes or no answer 
Sometimes genetic testing finds a gene that doctors aren t sure about 
A genetics professional can tell you what this means for your health 
People with Lynch syndrome often have tests to look for early signs of cancer 
If cancer is found when it s small, treatment is more likely to be successful 
Your health care provider will consider which Lynch syndrome gene you carry 
Your provider also considers what cancers run in your family 
This exam can find precancerous growths and areas of cancer 
Endometrial cancer is cancer that starts in the inside lining of the uterus 
To look for this cancer, you might have ultrasound imaging of the uterus

Some cholesterol tests don t require fasting, so follow your doctor s instructions 
In Canada and many European countries, cholesterol levels are measured in millimoles per liter mmol L 
Optimal for people at risk of coronary artery disease or who have diabetes 
Statins block a substance your liver needs to make cholesterol 
This causes your liver to remove cholesterol from your blood 
Your small intestine absorbs the cholesterol from your diet and releases it into your bloodstream 
The drug ezetimibe Zetia helps reduce blood cholesterol by limiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol 
Adding bempedoic acid Nexletol to a maximum statin dosage can help lower LDL significantly 
A combination pill containing both bempedoic acid and ezetimibe Nexlizet also is available 
Your liver uses cholesterol to make bile acids, a substance needed for digestion 
They are injected under the skin every few weeks and are expensive 
Medications for high triglyceridesIf you also have high triglycerides, your doctor might prescribe 
Using fibrates with a statin can increase the risk of statin side effects 
Niacin limits your liver s ability to produce LDL and VLDL cholesterol

Make a list of medications, vitamins and supplements you re taking 
What are my options, and what are the benefits and risks of each 
Also, drugs that treat some symptoms may result in side effects that worsen other symptoms 
Diagnosis Health care providers may suspect progeria based on symptoms 
A genetic test for changes in the LMNA gene can confirm the diagnosis of progeria 
Certain therapies may ease or delay some of the symptoms of progeria 
Treatment s depend on your child s condition and symptoms 
A daily dose may help prevent heart attacks and strokes 
These may include dietary therapy, possibly with statins to help blood vessels and heart function 
medicines to treat headaches and other symptoms may be needed 
A balanced diet that includes healthy, high calorie foods can help maintain adequate nutrition 
Regular visits with a pediatric dentist experienced with progeria can treat problems early 
Future treatmentCurrent research seeks to understand progeria and identify new treatment options 
Studying genes and the course of the condition to understand how it progresses 
remediesHere are some steps you can take at home to help your child 
Loss of water, called dehydration, can be more serious in children with progeria 
Loss of body fat in the feet can cause discomfort 
Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 
Apply sunscreen more often if your child is swimming or sweating 
Make sure your child is up to date on childhood vaccinations 
A child with progeria isn t at increased risk of infection 
But like all children, your child is at risk if exposed to infectious diseases 
Some adjustments for size and physical ability may be needed 
Your child may need clothes with special closures or in special sizes 
Coping and supportLearning that your child has progeria can be emotionally upsetting 
Also, ask your health care provider about self help groups or therapists in your community 
In a support group, you ll be with people who are facing challenges like yours 
Your child may have difficult but important questions about progeria, spirituality and religion 
Ask your health care provider, therapist or leader from your faith to help you prepare 
Consider input or guidance from friends you meet through support groups who ve shared this experience 
Talk openly and honestly with your child and your child s siblings 
Offer reassurance that fits with your belief system and is appropriate to the child s age 
After evaluation, your child may be referred to a medical genetics specialist 
Any signs and symptoms your child has been experiencing, and for how long 
Are my other children or family members at increased risk of this condition 
Are there clinical trials that my child might be able to join 
How can I find other families who have a child with this condition 
When did you first notice that something may be wrong 
Has your child been diagnosed with any diseases or conditions 
Diagnosis Your health care provider should start with a physical exam 
Pressing on the stomach area and scrotum to check for inguinal hernia 
In babies, a hydrocele sometimes goes away on its own 
But at any age, it s important for a health care provider to check a hydrocele 
That s because it can be linked to a problem with the testicles 
Some people don t have to stay at the hospital overnight after surgery 
One type of medicine puts you in a sleep like state, too 
Sometimes, a hydrocele is found during surgery to repair an inguinal hernia 
In this case, the surgeon might remove the hydrocele even if it s causing no discomfort 
You may need a follow up exam because a hydrocele might come back 
Preparing for your appointmentFor a hydrocele, you might see a doctor called a urologist 
This is an expert in problems of the urinary and reproductive tract 
List all medicines, vitamins and supplements that you or your child takes 
A dose is how much you or your child takes 
For hydrocele, some basic questions to ask your provider include 
What symptoms will mean that it s time to treat this condition 
Feel free to ask other questions that come up during your appointment 
Have you had any discharge from your penis or blood in your semen 
Do you have discomfort or pain in the affected area 
Have you and your partner been tested for sexually transmitted infections STIs 
Have you ever had a urinary tract or prostate infection, or other prostate conditions 
Have you ever had radiation or surgery in the affected area 
This includes sex, oral sex and any skin to skin genital contact 
This test is often the first test for infants because it s a simple, low risk procedure 
Ultrasound also might find hydrocephalus before birth during routine prenatal exams 
This test is painless, but it is noisy and requires lying still 
MRI scans can show enlarged ventricles caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid 
However, some hospitals use a fast version of MRI that usually doesn t require sedation 
This specialized X ray technology produces cross sectional views of the brain 
But this test also requires lying still, so a child usually receives a mild sedative 
And CT technology causes exposure to a small amount of radiation 
CT scans for hydrocephalus usually are used only for emergency exams 
Treatment One of two surgical treatments can be used to treat hydrocephalus 
One end of the tubing is usually placed in one of the brain s ventricles 
People who have hydrocephalus usually need a shunt system for the rest of their lives 
Endoscopic third ventriculostomySome people may have a surgery called endoscopic third ventriculostomy 
The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain 
Then the surgeon makes a hole in the bottom of a ventricle 
This allows cerebrospinal fluid to flow out of the brain 
Or shunt systems may poorly regulate drainage because of mechanical problems, a blockage or infections 
Fever or symptoms of hydrocephalus should prompt an appointment with your health care professional 
Other treatmentsSome people with hydrocephalus, particularly children, might need supportive therapies 
Need for these therapies depends on the long term complications of hydrocephalus 
Pediatrician or physiatrist, who oversees the treatment plan and medical care 
Pediatric neurologist, who specializes in diagnosing and treating neurological conditions in children 
Occupational therapist, who specializes in therapy to develop everyday skills 
Social worker, who helps the family get needed services and plan for transitions in care 
Special education teachers address learning disabilities, determine educational needs and help find needed resources 
Adults with more serious complications might need the services of occupational therapists or social workers 
Or they may need to see specialists in dementia care or other medical specialists 
Sometimes hydrocephalus can be diagnosed at birth or before birth 
Well baby visitsIt s important to take your child to all regularly scheduled well baby visits 
Health care professionals monitor your child s development in key areas, including 
Head size, rate of head growth and overall body growth 
Questions you should be prepared to answer during regular checkups might include 
Be prepared to answer the following questions about your symptoms or on your child s behalf 
Have you or your child had a headache or fever 
Is your child having trouble sleeping or lacking in energy 
In older children and adults, have symptoms included loss of bladder control and urinating often 
Have you or your child had a recent head injury 
Have you or your child recently begun a new medicine 
If you have hypercalcemia, your healthcare professional looks for its cause 
You might need imaging tests of your bones or lungs 
This helps find out if the cause is a disease such as cancer or sarcoidosis 
If your hypercalcemia is mild, you might not need treatment right away 
You and your healthcare professional may wait to see if symptoms start or become worse 
Your bones and kidneys might be checked over time to be sure they stay healthy 
MedicationsFor some people, medicines such as these may be recommended 
This hormone from salmon controls calcium levels in the blood 
This type of medicine can help control overactive parathyroid glands 
These osteoporosis medicines can quickly lower calcium levels when given through a vein IV 
This helps prevent heart rhythm problems or damage to the nervous system 
You also might need medicines called loop diuretics if your calcium level stays high 
Or you might need them if too much fluid builds up in your body 
In many people, only one of the four parathyroid glands is affected

And most often, it s just one of them that develops a tumor of it 
So PET choline is one of the newest imaging modalities that s out there 
It s really only available at a few centers across the country 
Then you ll likely be referred to a doctor called an endocrinologist, who treats hormonal conditions 
Include any that don t seem related to the reason for your checkup 
Include major stresses or recent life changes, your medical history, and your family s medical history 
That person can help you remember the Information you re given 
For hypercalcemia, basic questions to ask your healthcare team include 
Are there treatment options other than the one that you re suggesting 
What to expect from your doctorYour healthcare professional likely will ask you questions such as 
Laboratory testsYour doctor may also need Information from some of the following lab tests 
Blood tests, to detect autoimmune conditions, parasitic infections, or problems with your liver or kidneys 
Genetic test, to check for a gene mutation that can cause HES 
CT scan, to detect problems in the chest, abdomen and pelvis 
MedicationsSystemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the first line treatment 
Signs and symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for the appointment 
Any medications, including vitamins, herbs and over the counter medicines that you re taking, and their dosages 
Key personal Information, including any major stresses or recent changes in your life 
For hypereosinophilic syndrome, some basic questions to ask the doctor include 
What to expect from your doctorThe doctor is likely to ask you several questions 
Have you been exposed to any parasites such as hookworm 
You might be asked questions about your health history and eating habits 
Urine tests, to measure oxalate and other substances in the urine 
You re given a special container to collect your urine over hours 
DNA testing to look for the gene changes that cause primary hyperoxaluria 
Echocardiogram, an imaging test that can check for oxalate buildup in the heart 
Eye exam to check for oxalate deposits in the eyes 
Bone marrow biopsy to check for buildup of oxalate in the bones 
Liver biopsy to look for low levels of proteins, also called enzyme deficiencies 
Medical genetics counselors who have experience with hyperoxaluria can help guide your decisions and testing 
Your doctor also may give you other medicines, such as thiazide diuretics 
It depends on which other unusual signs are found in your urine 
This flushes the kidneys, prevents oxalate crystal buildup and helps keep kidney stones from forming 
Diet changes may help lower the levels of oxalate in your urine 
But diet changes may not help all people with primary hyperoxaluria 
But it doesn t keep up with the amount of oxalate your body makes 
A kidney transplant or kidney and liver transplant can treat primary hyperoxaluria 
A liver transplant is the only treatment that might cure some types of primary hyperoxaluria 
Write down your symptoms, including any that might not seem related to your health problem 
Make a list of all medicines and vitamins or other supplements that you take 
Include how much you take, which is called the dose 
If so, what type are they and how can I prevent them in the future 
Do you have any educational materials that I can take with me 
Feel free to ask any other questions that you think of during your appointment 
What to expect from your doctorYour doctor may ask questions such as 
Do your symptoms happen all the time or only once in a while 
To diagnose pulmonary hypertension, a health care professional examines you and asks about your symptoms 
You ll likely be asked questions about your medical and family history 
Blood tests can help find the cause of pulmonary hypertension or show signs of complications 
A chest X ray creates pictures of the heart, lungs and chest 
It may be used to check for other lung conditions that can cause pulmonary hypertension 
This simple test records the electrical activity of the heart 
Sound waves are used to create moving images of the beating heart 
If an echocardiogram shows pulmonary hypertension, this test may be done to confirm the diagnosis 
The catheter is gently guided into the lower right heart chamber and the pulmonary artery 
Other tests may be done to check the condition of the lungs and pulmonary arteries 
The following tests may give more Information about the cause of pulmonary hypertension 
This test uses X rays to create cross sectional images of specific parts of the body 
The device measures how much air the lungs can hold 
It shows how air flows in and out of the lungs 
The test can help diagnose sleep apnea, which can cause pulmonary hypertension 
In this test, a radioactive tracer is given through a vein IV 
You also may breathe in a tracer that shows airflow to the lungs 
A V Q scan can show whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension 
Genetic testingScreening for gene changes that cause pulmonary hypertension may be recommended 
If you have these gene changes, other family members may need to be screened too 
Pulmonary hypertension may fall into one of the following groups 
Class I Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed, but there are no symptoms during rest or exercise 
More Information Pulmonary hypertension care at Cardiac catheterizationChest X raysCT scanEchocardiogramGenetic testingMRIShow more related Information 
You also may get treatments for any health problem that might be causing pulmonary hypertension 
It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension 
medicines also may be used to treat or prevent complications 
Also called vasodilators, these medicines help open narrowed blood vessels and improve blood flow 
It may be breathed in, taken by mouth or given by IV 
Some types are given continuously through a small pump attached to the body 
Such medicines include bosentan Tracleer , macitentan Opsumit and ambrisentan Letairis 
They include sildenafil Revatio, Viagra and tadalafil Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis 
These medicines help relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels 
They include amlodipine Norvasc , diltiazem Cardizem, Tiazac, others and nifedipine Procardia 
This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood 
These medicines help the kidneys remove excess fluid from the body 
This reduces the amount of work the heart has to do 
Breathing pure oxygen is sometimes recommended as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension 
Some people with pulmonary hypertension need oxygen therapy all the time 
This treatment may be recommended if medicines don t control pulmonary hypertension symptoms 
The opening reduces the pressure on the right side of the heart 
More Information Pulmonary hypertension care at Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO Lung transplant 
Lifestyle and home remediesLifestyle changes may help improve pulmonary hypertension symptoms 
Try to stay away from saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol 
Even mild forms activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension 
Your health care team can help you plan an appropriate exercise program 
If you need support quitting, ask your health care team for treatment that can help 
Such activities lower blood pressure and can cause fainting or even death 
Give your health care team a list of your medicines 
Some medicines can make pulmonary hypertension worse or affect its treatment 
If pulmonary hypertension affects your quality of life, ask about options that could help 
Respiratory infections can cause serious health concerns for people with pulmonary hypertension 
Ask your health care team about recommend vaccines to prevent common viral infections 
Pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications to both mother and baby during pregnancy 
Birth control pills can increase the risk of blood clots 
Talk to your health care team about other birth control options 
For example, you might be told not to eat or drink before some medical tests 
Write down any symptoms you re having, including any that might seem unrelated to pulmonary hypertension 
Make a list of questions to ask your health care team 
For pulmonary hypertension, some basic questions to ask your health care team are 
What are the options to the primary treatment that you re suggesting 
How often should I be checked for changes in my condition 
Being ready to answer them might give you more time to discuss any concerns 
These changes may help prevent pulmonary hypertension from getting worse 
Diagnosis Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed with a medical history, physical exam and blood tests 
Depending on the results of the blood tests, you may need other tests too 
During the exam, your health care provider may check for 
Thyroid blood tests may give false results if you take biotin 
Biotin is a B vitamin supplement that also may be found in multivitamins 
Tell your health care provider if you are taking biotin or a multivitamin with biotin 
They can help find out why your thyroid is overactive 
The most likely cause is either Graves disease or overactive thyroid nodules 
This test uses high frequency sound waves to make images of the thyroid 
Ultrasound may be better at finding thyroid nodules than are other tests 
The best approach for you depends on your age and health 
The underlying cause of hyperthyroidism and how severe it is make a difference too 
Symptoms usually begin to improve within several weeks to months 
Treatment with anti thyroid medicine typically lasts to months 
For some people, anti thyroid medicine puts hyperthyroidism into long term remission 
But other people may find that hyperthyroidism comes back after this treatment 
Although rare, serious liver damage can happen with both anti thyroid medications 
These medicines generally aren t recommended for people who have asthma 
This treatment usually causes thyroid activity to slow enough to make the thyroid gland underactive 
This is surgery to remove part of or all of the thyroid gland 
But it may be an option for people who are pregnant 
Risks of this surgery include damage to the vocal cords and parathyroid glands 
The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands on the back of the thyroid 
They help control the level of calcium in the blood 
They include, tocilizumab Actemra , rituximab Rituxan and mycophenolate mofetil Cellcept 
In some cases, surgery may be needed to treat thyroid eye disease, including 
In this surgery, the bone between the eye socket and the sinuses is removed 
If you have double vision before the surgery, it may not go away afterward 
This pulls the eyes out of alignment, causing double vision 
Lifestyle and home remediesOnce you begin treatment, symptoms of hyperthyroidism likely will get better 
Kelp, dulse and other types of seaweed contain a lot of iodine 
Smoking has been linked to the development of thyroid eye disease 
And smoking can cause symptoms to come back after treatment 
Some people also tape their eyelids shut while they sleep 
Wear sunglasses to help protect your eyes from the sun and wind 
Raising the head of your bed may lessen swelling and ease pressure on your eyes 
It improves muscle tone and helps keep your heart and lungs healthy 
Many relaxation techniques can help you keep a positive outlook, especially when coping with illness 
Research has shown that for Graves disease in particular, stress is a risk factor 
But you may be referred directly to a specialist in hormone disorders, called an endocrinologist 
Someone who is there with you may remember Information you missed or forgot 
Have you had any recent radiology scans that used intravenous contrast 
It involves having at least three of the following symptoms, which cause sadness or anxiety 
No desire to have any type of sexual activity or to masturbate 
Not wanting to make the first move in a sexual encounter with a partner 
Less or no interest in any sexual or erotic cues from a partner 
Few or no physical sensations during sexual activity in most sexual encounters 
You don t have to fit this definition to reach out for help 
During your appointment, your healthcare professional asks you questions about your medical and sexual history 
They also can look for thyroid problems, diabetes, high cholesterol and liver disorders 
Recommendations may include sex education, counseling, and sometimes medicine and hormone therapy 
Your therapist or counselor likely will offer recommendations for reading material or couples exercises 
Couples counseling that addresses relationship issues also may help boost feelings of intimacy and desire 
For example, SSRI antidepressants such as paroxetine Paxil and fluoxetine Prozac may lower sex drive 
Lower the amount of medicine you take, called the dose 
Switching to a different type of antidepressant may lead to fewer sexual side effects 
If you take an SSRI, your healthcare professional might add bupropion to your treatment 
Options for women who have not yet reached menopause include 
This is a pill that you take once a day at bedtime 
Side effects include low blood pressure, drowsiness, dizziness, upset stomach and fatigue 
Some women get an upset stomach after taking the medicine 
This side effect tends to get better with the second shot 
In the United States, these medicines aren t approved for use after menopause 
This condition might make sex not comfortable and, in turn, reduce your desire 
Some hormone medicines that aim to relieve GSM symptoms could help make sex more comfortable 
And being more comfortable during sex may boost your desire 
Smaller amounts of estrogen are found in vaginal creams and a slow releasing suppository or ring 
Your healthcare professional can help you understand the risks and benefits of each form 
Vaginal estrogen used in small doses is unlikely to raise the risk of breast cancer 
But estrogen won t improve sexual functioning related to sexual interest arousal disorder 
Still, sometimes it s prescribed to help lift a lagging libido 
At first, this treatment can be tried for up to six months 
If it helps, it can be continued with close monitoring by a healthcare professional 
Regular aerobic exercise and strength training are great for you in general 
Sharing your likes and dislikes can set the stage for more intimacy 
With regular use, they might work about as well as estrogen therapy 
Smoking, using illegal drugs and drinking too much alcohol can dampen your sex drive 
Stopping these habits may help give your sex drive a boost 
So some people decide to try herbal supplements available without a prescription 
Herbal supplements can have side effects or change how other medicines work 
But some participants in the study said they had mild burning in the genital area 
Coping and supportLow sex drive can be challenging for you and your partner 
At the same time, low sex drive can make your partner feel rejected 
And this type of relationship stress can lessen the desire for sex even more 
It may help to remember that changes in sex drive are typical 
They re part of every relationship and every stage of life 
Try not to focus all of your attention on sex 
Kiss your partner goodbye before you head out the door 
Feeling good about yourself and your partner can be the best foreplay 
If your healthcare professional doesn t mention the subject, you can bring it up 
You might feel embarrassed to talk about sex with your healthcare professional 
In fact, your sexual satisfaction is a vital part of your overall health and well being 
What you can doTo prepare for this talk with your healthcare professional 
Include when and how often you usually have these issues 
Also note the names of all medicines, vitamins or supplements you take 
Think about questions to ask your healthcare professional and write them down 
Bring along notepaper and a pen or a device you can type on 
That way, you can jot down Information as your healthcare professional answers your questions 
Will my level of desire ever get back to what it once was 
What lifestyle changes can I make to improve my situation 
Do you have vaginal dryness, trouble having an orgasm or any pain during sex 
How much distress do you feel about your sexual concerns 
How long have you felt a lack of desire or other symptoms 
Have you had any surgeries of the genitals or reproductive system 
What is your blood sugar level when you re having symptoms 
Your health care provider will draw a blood sample to be analyzed in the lab 
Treatment Immediate hypoglycemia treatmentIf you have hypoglycemia symptoms, do the following 
Eat or drink to grams of fast acting carbohydrates 
Try glucose tablets or gel, fruit juice, regular not diet soda, honey, or sugary candy 
Repeat these steps until the blood sugar is above mg dL mmol L 
For example, if you can t eat, you might need a glucagon injection or intravenous glucose 
A tumor in your pancreas is typically treated by surgical removal of the tumor 
In some cases, medication to control hypoglycemia or partial removal of the pancreas is necessary 
Someone who accompanies you can help you remember the Information you re given 
Make a list of your symptoms, including when they started and how often they occur 
Provide your diabetes treatment Information if you have diabetes 
List your typical daily habits, including alcohol intake, meals and exercise routines 
Questions to ask your health care provider if you have diabetes include 
Do I need to change my eating or exercise routine 
Questions to ask your health care provider if you haven t been diagnosed with diabetes include 
What self care steps, including lifestyle changes, can I take to help improve my symptoms 
Your health care provider will ask additional questions based on your responses, symptoms and needs 
To confirm low blood sodium, your doctor will order blood tests and urine tests 
Treatment Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at addressing the underlying cause, if possible 
If you have severe, acute hyponatremia, you ll need more aggressive treatment 
List any symptoms you or your loved one has been experiencing and for how long 
For hyponatremia, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
How soon do you expect my symptoms will begin to improve 
Do I need to make any changes to how much fluid I usually drink 
Have your symptoms been getting any better or worse since they first developed 
Have your symptoms included any mental changes, such as feeling confused, agitated or depressed 
A clinic that specializes in endocrine conditions can run these tests to measure hormone levels 
Treatment Hypopituitarism is treated with medicines that raise hormone levels 
Testosterone is given by a shot, pills, patch or gel 
Estrogen and progesterone usually are given in pills, gels or patches 
Gonadotropins can be given by a shot to help ovulation and sperm production 
This is to ensure that the right amount of medicine is given 
Under stress, the body usually makes extra cortisol to help manage the stress 
The same might be true during pregnancy or with big changes in body weight 
Some tumors also can be treated with medicines or radiation therapy 
This is especially important for those taking cortisol replacement for a lack of ACTH 
Sometimes, you might be referred to a specialist in endocrine disorders, known as an endocrinologist 
Someone who accompanies you can help you remember what your care provider tells you 
What to expect from your doctorYour care provider might ask questions, such as 
Has your weight or the amount of your body hair changed 
Have you ever had radiation treatment for a head or neck tumor 
Have any of your family members been diagnosed with pituitary or hormonal conditions 
A routine ultrasound exam during the second trimester of pregnancy might show the condition 
And an echocardiogram can identify other heart conditions, such as an atrial septal defect 
Your child s health care provider will discuss treatment options with you 
Options to help manage a baby s condition before surgery or transplant include 
Babies who have trouble breathing might need help from a breathing machine ventilator 
A baby might receive fluids through a tube inserted into a vein 
This is done if the foramen ovale closes or is too small 
Babies who already have an opening atrial septal defect might not need this procedure 
Surgeries and other proceduresChildren with hypoplastic left heart syndrome will likely need several surgeries 
This surgery is usually done within the first two weeks of life 
Surgeons reconstruct the aorta and connect it to the heart s lower right chamber 
This allows the right ventricle to pump blood to both the lungs and the body 
It s done when a child is between and months of age 
If surgeons previously performed a hybrid procedure, they ll follow additional steps during this procedure 
The pulmonary arteries then send the blood into the lungs 
After this procedure, there s little mixing of oxygen rich and oxygen poor blood in the heart 
Various complications can occur over time and might require further treatment or other medications 
Follow up care for adultsAdult care requires a cardiologist trained in congenital heart disease in adults 
So it s not yet clear what challenges an adult with the condition might face 
Adults need regular, lifelong follow up care to watch for changes in the condition 
Talk with your child s cardiologist about support groups and other types of assistance 
It can be helpful to talk to other people who share your challenges 
Include a copy of the report from the surgeon in the records 
This Information will help you keep track of the care received 
It will be useful for care providers who don t know the complex health history 
Talk with your child s cardiologist about which activities are best for your child 
Diagnosis Your child s pediatrician can diagnose hypospadias based on a physical exam 
Medical centers with specialty teams can help you evaluate options and can provide expert treatment 
In this case, further evaluation with a multidisciplinary team is recommended 
Some forms of hypospadias are very minor and do not require surgery 
Surgery is usually done between the ages of and months 
If the penis looks abnormal, circumcision should not be done 
If hypospadias is found during circumcision, the procedure should be completed 
In either case, referral to a pediatric urologist is recommended 
Some forms of hypospadias will require more than one surgery to correct the defect 
Follow up careYour child will need a couple of visits to the surgeon after surgery 
Will this condition affect my child s fertility or sexual function later in life 
Has anyone else in your family been diagnosed with hypospadias 
Have you noticed any abnormal spraying when your child urinates 
Someone having a tilt table test begins by lying flat on a table 
Other tests may be done to determine the cause of low blood pressure 
Wires attached to the sensors connect to a machine that displays or prints out results 
An ECG shows how fast or slow the heart is beating 
It can be used to diagnose a current or previous heart attack 
A tilt table test can evaluate how the body reacts to changes in position 
Heart rate and blood pressure are monitored during the test 
More Information Blood pressure testEchocardiogramElectrocardiogram ECG or EKG Stress testTilt table testShow more related Information 
Low blood pressure hypotension without symptoms or with only mild symptoms rarely requires treatment 
If low blood pressure is causing symptoms, the treatment depends on the cause 
Don t change or stop taking your medication without first talking to your care provider 
Experts usually recommend limiting salt sodium because it can raise blood pressure, sometimes dramatically 
For people with low blood pressure, however, that can be a good thing 
But too much sodium can lead to heart failure, especially in older adults 
So it s important to check with a health care provider before increasing salt 
They improve blood flow from the legs to the heart 
Some people tolerate elastic abdominal binders better than they do compression stockings 
This drug reduces the ability of the blood vessels to expand, which raises blood pressure 
Alcohol is dehydrating and can lower blood pressure, even if drinking in moderation 
Water increases the amount of blood in the body and prevents dehydration 
Gently move from lying flat or squatting to a standing position 
These moves encourage blood flow from the legs to the heart 
Limit high carbohydrate foods such as potatoes, rice, pasta and bread 
Preparing for your appointmentNo special preparations are necessary to have your blood pressure checked 
Symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to low blood pressure, and when they occur 
All medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including doses 
For low blood pressure, basic questions to ask your provider include 
How often should I be screened for low blood pressure 
Do you always have symptoms of low blood pressure, or do they come and go 
The symptoms of hypothyroidism can be different from person to person 
And they often look like symptoms of other health problems 
Because of that, a diagnosis of hypothyroidism doesn t rely on symptoms alone 
In some cases, the thyroid hormone T may be measured as well 
TSH tests also play an important role in managing hypothyroidism over time 
The results of these blood tests can be affected by some medicines or supplements 
It returns hormone levels to a healthy range, eliminating symptoms of hypothyroidism 
You ll likely start to feel better one or two weeks after you begin treatment 
You may need another blood test to check TSH again six months later 
Levothyroxine typically causes no side effects when used in the correct dose 
This allows your heart to adjust to the rise in your body s metabolism 
Don t skip doses or stop taking the medicine because you feel better 
If you do, it s likely that the symptoms of hypothyroidism will slowly return 
If you miss a dose of levothyroxine, take two pills the next day 
Some medicines, supplements and even some foods may affect your body s ability to absorb levothyroxine 
Also, tell your provider if you take other medicines, especially 
For a mild rise in TSH, thyroid hormone medicine may not be useful 
But an extract containing thyroid hormone derived from the thyroid glands of pigs is available 
Preparing for your appointmentYou ll likely start by seeing your primary health care provider 
Or you may be referred to a specialist in hormone disorders, called an endocrinologist 
Infants with hypothyroidism need to see a pediatric endocrinologist right away 
Children or teens can start with their primary health care provider 
Gastroenterologist William Faubion, M D , answers the most frequently asked questions about inflammatory bowel disease 
But what we really care about is quality of life 
The second most important thing is having the right genes 
The genetics of inflammatory bowel disease is complicated and actually quite widespread 
And then the third component is these two things impact on the immune system 
The main risk factor for cancer would be colorectal or cancer of the large bowel 
And that comes, we believe, from the chronic inflammation of the colon 
That s why it s a good idea to maintain close contact with your treatment team 
Generally the risk is slightly higher for Crohn s disease than ulcerative colitis 
This science was actually developed for an infection rather than inflammatory bowel disease 
The science has been developed over a period of about years 
So I think just showing up is the first thing that you can do 
We always consider this as a partnership between the patient and the provider 
There s a lot to consider when we talk about the medications for inflammatory bowel disease 
So those discussions are important, can be complex and can be time consuming 
So showing up, being present, participating in those conversations, and being educated yourself 
Communicating well with your team and again, just being there and showing up 
During the procedure, small samples of tissue biopsy may be taken for laboratory analysis 
This test is sometimes used to help diagnose Crohn s disease involving your small intestine 
You swallow a capsule that has a camera in it 
Capsule endoscopy should not be performed if a bowel obstruction is suspected 
For this test, a scope is used in conjunction with a device called an overtube

Or the sample might be taken during surgery to remove the cancer 
The goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer cells 
Whenever possible, surgeons work to remove the entire liposarcoma without damaging any surrounding organs 
In those situations, your health care team may recommend other treatments to shrink the liposarcoma 
That will make it easier to remove during an operation 
Some chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein and some are taken in pill form 
Careful testing of your cancer cells can show whether chemotherapy is likely to help you 
Chemotherapy may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain 
It also may be used before surgery to shrink a tumor 
Chemotherapy is sometimes combined with radiation therapy are studies of new treatments 
These studies give you a chance to try the latest treatment options 
Know how much you take and when you take it 
Also tell your doctor why you are taking each medicine 
What would happen if I choose not to have treatment 
What to expect from your doctorBe prepared to answer some basic questions about your symptoms 
This ultrasound shows a liver tumor that isn t cancer, called benign 
Finding the cause of liver damage and how bad it is help guide treatment 
Your healthcare professional starts with a health history and complete physical exam 
A group of blood tests called liver function tests can diagnose liver disease 
An ultrasound, CT scan and MRI can show liver damage 
Removing a tissue sample, called a biopsy, from the liver may help diagnose liver disease 
The sample is then sent to a lab for testing

Treatment Treatment for liver disease depends on the diagnosis 
These changes often are part of a medical program that includes watching liver function 
Other liver problems may be treated with medicines or surgery 
Liver disease that causes liver failure may need a liver transplant 
Lifestyle and home remediesChanging some lifestyle habits often can help improve liver health 
If you ve been diagnosed with liver disease, your healthcare professional might suggest that you 
Don t eat foods with a lot of sugar or fructose 
Eat healthier fats, such as those in fish, olive oil and walnuts 
More than , medicines and herbal products have been linked to liver damage 
Your key medical Information, including other conditions you have and family history of liver disease 
Key personal Information, including any recent changes or stressors in your life 
Do I need to prepare for any of the tests 
Are my liver problems likely to go away or to last 
Does anything seem to improve your symptoms, or make them worse 
Have you ever had your skin or eyes turn yellow 
Does your job put you in contact with chemicals, blood or body fluids 
Have you been told that you have had liver problems 
It s important to distinguish morphea from systemic scleroderma and other conditions 
Treatment Morphea usually lasts several years and then goes away without treatment 
It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin 
Skin generally begins to improve during the first months of treatment 
Or your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream to reduce inflammation 
When used for a long time, these creams may thin the skin 
For severe or widespread morphea, treatment may include the use of ultraviolet light phototherapy 
Or your doctor may suggest hydroxychloroquine Plaquenil or mycophenolate mofetil 
Talk with your doctor about a drug s risks and benefits before using it 
If the condition affects your joints, physical therapy might preserve your range of motion 
You may also be concerned that it will get worse before it goes away 
For morphea, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
If the skin discoloration and hardening clears up, will it ever come back 
Do you have any brochures or other printed materials I can take with me 
Do the changes come and go or are they constant 
Have you ever been treated by a doctor for this condition 
Have you experienced extreme cold sensitivity in your fingers or toes 
The disease progresses for about two weeks, and recovery can last about a month 
Antitoxin therapy is used to target toxins that have not yet attacked nerve tissues 
This treatment, called passive immunization, is a human antibody to the toxin 
Sedatives that slow the function of the nervous system can help control muscle spasms 
Vaccination with one of the standard tetanus vaccinations helps your immune system fight the toxins 
Antibiotics, given either orally or by injection, may help fight tetanus bacteria 
Morphine might be used for this purpose as well as for sedation 
A feeding tube into the stomach is used to provide nutrients 
Lifestyle and home remediesProper wound care is important for any cut or wound 
If you re unsure when you last had a tetanus vaccine, seek medical care 
If you have a minor wound, these steps will help prevent infections 
Bandages can keep the wound clean and keep harmful bacteria out 
The health care provider uses a stethoscope to listen to your heart 
It reflects a disturbance in how the heart s bottom chambers ventricles send signals 
This is the most common test used to diagnose long QT syndrome 
An ECG measures the timing and duration of each electrical phase in the heartbeat 
The signals are shown as waves on an attached computer monitor or printer 
Waves Q through T show the electrical activity in the heart s lower chambers ventricles 
If the interval takes longer than usual to occur, it s called a prolonged QT interval 
An optimal QT interval depends on your age, your sex and your individual heart rate 
If long QT symptoms are infrequent, they may not be seen on a standard ECG 
It s worn for a day or more to record the heart s activity during daily activities 
Some devices automatically record when an irregular heartbeat arrhythmia is detected 
Ask your health care provider if this is an option for you 
Genetic testingA genetic test for long QT syndrome is available to confirm the diagnosis 
Check with your insurer to see if it is covered 
It s recommended that families speak to a genetic counselor before and after testing 
The goal of LQTS treatment is to prevent erratic heartbeats and sudden death 
You may need treatment even if you don t often have symptoms 
Your health care provider can tell you how to safely do so 
For other types of acquired long QT syndrome, treating the underlying condition is necessary 
These heart drugs are standard therapy for most patients with long QT syndrome 
They slow the heart rate and make long QT episodes less likely 
Surgery or other proceduresSome people with long QT syndrome need surgery to control the heartbeat 
Surgery or other procedures used to treat LQTS may include 
Most people with long QT syndrome don t need an ICD 
However, an ICD may be recommended for certain athletes to allow return to competitive sports 
The decision to implant an ICD, especially in children, needs to be carefully considered 
In general, people with long QT syndrome should never swim alone 
Wear a medical alert identification to notify others of your condition 
You may be referred to a health care provider with special training in heart conditions 
Providers that help care for people with long QT syndrome include 
Include those that may seem unrelated to long QT syndrome 
Questions to ask the health care provider at your first appointment include 
Questions to ask if you re referred to a cardiologist or electrophysiologist include 
Questions to ask if your health care provider recommends surgery include 
What type of procedure is most likely to be effective in my case and why 
Should I be referred to a long QT syndrome center of excellence 
What should I expect from my recovery and rehabilitation after surgery 
Will I need frequent exams and lifelong treatment for this condition 
What emergency symptoms of long QT syndrome should I be aware of 
Will it be safe for me to become pregnant in the future 
What is the risk that my future children will have long QT syndrome 
Do strong emotions such as anger, excitement or surprise trigger your symptoms 
Are you aware of any history of heart conditions in your family 
The following can be used to determine whether you have thrombocytopenia 
For example, if you have heparin induced thrombocytopenia, your doctor can prescribe a different blood thinning drug 
If that doesn t work, stronger medications can be used to suppress your immune system 
If other treatments don t help, your doctor might recommend surgery to remove your spleen splenectomy 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can result in a medical emergency requiring plasma exchange 
Contact sports, such as boxing, martial arts and football, carry a high risk of injury 
Ask your doctor whether it s OK for you to drink alcohol 
Your doctor might also ask about your sexual habits and your sexual development 
Semen analysisA low sperm count is diagnosed as part of a semen analysis test 
In some cases, a computer might be used to measure sperm count 
So, a current semen analysis reflects your environment over the past three months 
Any positive changes you ve made won t show up for several months 
Have you abstain from ejaculating for two to seven days before collecting a sample 
Collect a second sample at least two weeks after the first 
Have you avoid the use of lubricants because these products can affect sperm motility 
Your chance of getting your partner pregnant decreases with decreasing sperm counts 
Some men have no sperm in their semen at all 
Likewise, some men with normal sperm counts are unable to father children 
This test uses high frequency sound waves to look at the testicles and supporting structures 
When sperm concentration is extremely low, genetic causes could be involved 
Genetic testing might also be ordered to diagnose various congenital or inherited syndromes 
The results of the testicular biopsy can tell if sperm production is normal 
These tests are rarely performed and often do not significantly change treatment recommendations 
Treatment Treatment s for low sperm count include 
Antibiotics can cure an infection of the reproductive tract, but this doesn t always restore fertility 
Alternative medicinesupplements with studies showing potential benefits on improving sperm count or quality include 
Preparing for your appointmentYou should start with your family doctor or a different provider 
However, he or she might refer you to an infertility specialist 
What do you suspect might be causing my low sperm count 
Other than the most likely cause, what are other possible reasons my partner 
At what point should we consider other alternatives, such as a sperm donor or adoption 
What to expect from your doctorSome questions your doctor may ask you include 
Besides the usual blood and urine tests, urine collected over hours might be tested 
A small section of kidney tissue is removed and sent to a lab 
It also can help show how bad the disease is 
Supportive treatmentsIn general, these treatments might help people with kidney disease 
These medicines also keep protein from leaking from the kidneys into the urine 
Sometimes certain medicines used at first are switched to prevent toxic effects 
Ongoing clinical trials are testing new treatments for lupus nephritis 
In most cases, recovery will be quicker and more complete the sooner treatment begins 
Antibiotic pillsThe standard treatment for Lyme disease is an antibiotic taken as a pill 
Treatment may be longer depending on your symptoms 
It s important to take all pills as directed even if you re feeling better 
An IV antibiotic may be used for more serious disease, especially if you have symptoms of 
The biting tick is known to be a deer tick 
You live in or recently visited an area where Lyme disease is common 
The tick was attached to the skin for hours or more 
Other treatments have not been shown to work or haven t been tested 
Illness after Lyme diseaseYou may have heard the term chronic Lyme disease 
Research has found that these symptoms aren t related to ongoing illness caused by borrelia bacteria 
Research also shows that continued use of antibiotics doesn t improve these symptoms 
If you have them, wear medical gloves or similar gloves to protect your hands 
To avoid exposure to possible bacteria, don t crush the tick 
The dead tick can be flushed down a drain or toilet 
A tick can be evaluated later if you think you have a tick borne disease 
Then clean the site and your hands with rubbing alcohol 
Jeff Olsen While you re enjoying a hike, ticks are looking for a ride 
And they will climb up the nearest object, like this blade of grass here 
Jeff Olsen You can lessen the chances you ll become a host 
Dr Bobbi Pritt Using insect repellents is a good idea 
parasitic diseases expert Dr Bobbi Pritt suggests permethrin for your clothing and gear 
Leave them out to dry, and, then, the next day, wear them 
Jeff Olsen Use permethrin on materials and DEET on skin 
Spray the DEET repellent on exposed skin, including your legs and hands 
Avoid your face, but be sure to protect your neck 
And, on your hike, remember to avoid areas where those questing ticks may be perched

This X ray technique produces detailed, cross sectional images of the body s structures 
This test uses sound waves to produce images of internal structures 
It can help find obstructions within the lymphatic system and vascular system 
The resulting images show the dye moving through the lymph vessels, highlighting blockages 
Treatment focuses on reducing the swelling and preventing complications 
You may need to be measured by a professional to ensure proper fit 
The excess lymph fluid is then removed from the limb via blood vessels 
In severe lymphedema, the soft tissues in the limb become fibrous and hardened 
Removing some of this hardened tissue, often through liposuction, can improve the limb s function 
In very severe cases, hardened tissue and skin may be removed with a scalpel 
Coping and supportIt can be frustrating to know there s no cure for lymphedema 
Taking care of your body gives you more energy and encourages healing 
Key personal Information, including major illnesses or trauma, cancer treatments or recent life changes

Hematologist Stephen Ansell, M D , answers the most frequently asked questions about lymphoma 
We can see that the cells undergo a genetic change 
But exactly what brought about that genetic change, we don t always know 
Well, I think it s important to recognize what the goals of treatment are 
However, we do not have a curative treatment that will fix the cancer right away 
Well, important to know that chemotherapy may have two components 
The challenge, however, is there are healthy cells that may also be growing quickly 
Immunotherapy, as I mentioned, binds or attacks proteins on the outsides of cells 
The goal moving forward is for you to have the best outcome possible 
Consider getting a second opinion from a specialist who can confirm your diagnosis 
Until then, you may undergo periodic tests to monitor your condition 
Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast growing cells, such as cancer cells 
Immunotherapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells 
Alternative medicine No supplements have been found to treat lymphoma 
With time you ll find ways to cope with the stress and uncertainty of cancer 
Ask for good sources of up to date Information on your treatment options 
For lymphoma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Blood tests can show if there are too few healthy blood cells 
Also, blood tests detect a protein made by the cancer cells 
This protein is immunoglobulin M, which is also called IgM 
Blood tests also can show how well organs are working 
The sample goes to a lab where it is tested for cancer cells 
If there are cancer cells, more tests can give more Information about the cells 
Imaging tests can help show whether cancer has spread to other areas of the body 
Treatment Treatment options for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia may include 
Instead, you might have blood tests every few months to monitor your condition 
Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis, removes IgM proteins from the blood 
Plasma exchange can relieve symptoms caused by having too many IgM proteins in the blood 
Chemotherapy uses strong medicines to kill cancer cells throughout the body 
Targeted therapy medicines might be used with other treatments, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy 
During this procedure, high doses of chemotherapy wipe out the bone marrow 
Healthy blood stem cells go into the body to rebuild healthy bone marrow

Imaging tests may include X rays, CT, MRI and positron emission tomography PET scans 
This Information helps rule out other types of cancer and guides your treatment 
Treatment for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma usually involves surgery to remove the cancer cells 
SurgeryWhen possible, doctors try to remove the sarcoma completely with surgery 
When the cancer affects the arms and legs, surgeons prefer to use limb sparing operations 
However, in some cases it may be necessary to amputate the affected arm or leg 
The machine directs the radiation to precise points on your body 
It may also be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain 
IORT is used during surgery just after the cancer is removed 
The radiation is directed to the area around where the cancer used to be 
It can be administered by pill or through a vein intravenously , or both 
For undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, targeted therapy drugs may be combined with chemotherapy 
Immunotherapy treatments are generally reserved for people with advanced cancer 
Alternative medicine No alternative treatments have been found helpful in treating undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma 
Coping and supportA diagnosis of cancer such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma can be overwhelming 
Keeping your close relationships strong will help you deal with your diagnosis and care implications

Should I get additional treatments such as radiation therapy either before or after an operation 
Diagnosis Tests and procedures used to diagnose malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors include 
Tests might include magnetic resonance imaging, also called MRI, or magnetic resonance neurography 
The health care team uses this Information to make a treatment plan 
Treatment Treatment for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors often involves 
When that can t be done, surgeons remove as much of the tumor as they can 
That might make it more likely that all of the tumor is removed during surgery 
Radiation may be used before surgery to shrink a tumor 
This might make it more likely that all of the tumor is removed during surgery 
After surgery, radiation therapy can be used to kill any cancer cells that might remain 
Chemotherapy might help control symptoms and slow the growth of the cancer

This test uses sound waves to capture real time images of your heart in motion 
It checks the condition of your heart valves and the size of your aorta 
Other heart imaging options include computerized tomography CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging MRI 
This test checks for lens dislocation, cataracts or a detached retina 
Your eyes will need to be completely dilated with drops for this exam 
Genetic testingGenetic testing is often used to confirm the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome 
In the past, people who had Marfan syndrome often died young 
Your aortic valve may need to be replaced as well 
When there is significant scoliosis, a consultation with a spine expert is necessary 
Surgical options are available to correct the appearance of a sunken or protruding breastbone 
If you have cataracts, your clouded lens can be replaced with an artificial lens 
It contains the aortic valve and the origin of the coronary arteries 
Replacement of the aortic root is indicated in the presence of an aortic aneurysm 
An aneurysm is an abnormal enlargement of a blood vessel 
Conditions in which the aortic wall is intrinsically weaker mandate intervention at a lower size 
Most of these conditions are due to genetic abnormality of the aortic wall 
The alternative tissue aortic valve would not require Coumadin but has limited lifespan, necessitating re operation 
The reimplantation technique over subsequent years has proved to be the most durable 
Within this tube, the three dimensional aortic valve is reimplanted, thus the name 
Over the years, factors have been identified that impact the successful outcome of the procedure 
When aortic valve leaflets are of good quality and can be spared, they should be 
And they may worry about passing the defective gene to their children

Physical examYour healthcare professional will ask questions about your health history 
That person also will examine your skin to look for signs that could mean melanoma 
What type of biopsy procedure is used depends on your situation 
Most often healthcare professionals recommend removing the entire growth when possible 
Melanoma spread How lymph nodes play a role in detection 
To assign a stage to your melanoma, your healthcare team will 
In general, the thicker the melanoma, the more serious the disease 
The thickness of a melanoma helps your care team decide on a treatment plan 
See if the melanoma has spread to the lymph nodes 
These first lymph nodes are called the sentinel lymph nodes 
If they re cancer free, there s a good chance that the melanoma has not spread 
Other factors may go into determining the risk that the cancer may spread 
Your healthcare team uses the results from these tests to figure out your melanoma s stage 
At stage and stage , a melanoma is thin and small 
As the melanoma grows deeper into the skin, the stages get higher 
Treatment Melanoma treatment often starts with surgery to remove the cancer 
Other treatments may include radiation therapy and treatment with medicine 
These factors include the stage of your cancer, your overall health and your own preferences 
SurgeryTreatment for melanoma usually includes surgery to remove the melanoma 
So other treatments are often used to make sure all the cancer cells are killed

They can help you remember the Information you re given 
For MEN some basic questions to ask your health care provider include 
Is there anything I can do to lower my risk of getting cancer 
A meningioma can be hard to diagnose because the tumor is often slow growing 
CT scans take X rays that make cross sectional images of a full picture of the brain 
Sometimes an iodine based dye is used to make the picture easier to read 
MRI scans provide a more detailed picture of the brain and meningiomas 
Treatment Treatment for a meningioma depends on many factors, including 
Wait and see approachNot everyone with a meningioma needs treatment right away 
A small, slow growing meningioma that isn t causing symptoms may not need treatment 
Then, surgeons remove as much of the meningioma as they can 
The type of treatment, if any, you need after surgery depends on several factors 
If no visible tumor remains, then no further treatment may be needed 
But you will have follow up scans from time to time 
If the tumor is irregular or cancer, you ll likely need radiation 
The risks of your surgery will depend on where your meningioma is 
Radiation therapy uses a large machine to aim high powered energy beams at the tumor cells 
This type of radiation treatment aims several beams of powerful radiation at a precise point 
Radiosurgery most often is done in an outpatient setting in a few hours 
This uses computer software to lower the intensity of radiation to the meningioma site 
This type lessens damage to the tissue around the tumor 
medicinesmedicine therapy, also called chemotherapy, rarely is used to treat meningiomas 
But it may be used when the meningioma doesn t respond to surgery and radiation 
There isn t a widely used chemotherapy approach to the treatment of meningiomas

Get moderate exercise daily if your healthcare professional OKs it 
Preparing for your appointmentYou can start by seeing your main healthcare professional 
Someone who goes with you can help you remember the Information you get 
Can you suggest a specialist or hospital that has experience in treating meningiomas 
A sample also may be placed on a slide and stained 
Then it will be studied under a microscope to see whether bacteria are present 
A definitive diagnosis of meningitis requires a spinal tap to collect cerebrospinal fluid 
Analyzing the fluid also may help identify which bacterium caused the meningitis 
The treatment depends on the type of meningitis you or your child has 
Bacterial meningitisAcute bacterial meningitis must be treated right away with intravenous antibiotics and sometimes corticosteroids 
The antibiotic or combination of antibiotics depends on the type of bacteria causing the infection 
Treatment of mild cases of viral meningitis usually includes

What are the options to the main treatment you re suggesting 
A device called a stethoscope is used to listen to the heart and lungs 
If you have mitral valve regurgitation, a whooshing sound called a murmur may be heard 
The mitral valve heart murmur is the sound of blood leaking backward through the valve 
An echocardiogram shows the structure of the mitral valve and blood flow in the heart 
The test also can tell how severe the condition is 
Sometimes, a more detailed echocardiogram is needed to better see the mitral valve 
A TEE creates pictures of the heart from inside the body 
Sticky patches called sensors are attached to the chest and sometimes the arms and legs 
An ECG can show irregular heart rhythms related to mitral valve disease 
This quick test can help diagnose an enlarged heart or fluid in the lungs 
Cardiac MRI may help show the severity of mitral valve regurgitation 
The test also gives details about the lower left heart chamber 
The tests can show whether mitral valve regurgitation symptoms occur during exercise 
This test isn t often used to diagnose mitral valve disease 
But it can be helpful if other tests haven t diagnosed the condition 
OutlookHow well a person does after being diagnosed with mitral valve regurgitation varies 
How long the condition has been present, also called the duration 
Some people, especially those with mild regurgitation, might not need treatment 
medicines to treat symptoms and prevent complications, such as blood clots

The device is pressed firmly against the skin on the chest area 
If more detailed images are needed, another type of echocardiogram may be done 
Those with less severe mitral stenosis need an echocardiogram about every to years 
A cardiac MRI might be done to determine the severity of mitral valve stenosis 
Instead, you ll have regular checkups with your provider to see if your condition gets worse 
MedicationsMedications are used to reduce the symptoms of mitral valve stenosis 
Your provider might prescribe one or more of the following medications 
Diuretics to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs or other areas of the body

What can I eat or drink to help my queasiness 
What to expect from your doctorYour health care provider might ask you 
Do you notice certain triggers for your nausea or vomiting 
Do your symptoms occur at certain times of the day or all the time 
There may also be a feeling of clicking between the bones of your foot 
Imaging testsSome imaging tests are more useful than others in the diagnosis of Morton s neuroma 
This technology uses sound waves to create real time images of internal structures 
Ultrasound is particularly good at revealing soft tissue abnormalities, such as neuromas 
But it s an expensive test and often indicates neuromas in people who have no symptoms 
Treatment Treatment depends on the severity of your symptoms 
TherapyWear shoes with adequate room across the ball of the foot and in the toe 
Surgical and other proceduresIf conservative treatments haven t helped, your doctor might suggest 
Some people are helped by the injection of steroids into the painful area

Does any type of activity ease the pain or worsen it 
Are you having pain in any other part of your body 
Skeeter syndrome is the result of an allergic reaction to proteins in mosquito saliva 
There s no simple blood test to detect mosquito antibodies in blood 
Antibodies are substances the body produces during an allergic reaction 
It may help to apply calamine lotion or a nonprescription antihistamine cream or corticosteroid cream 
Or try dabbing the bite with a paste made of baking soda and water 
Reapply the cream or the paste three times a day until the itch is gone 
Try soothing an itchy bite by rubbing it with an ice cube for seconds 
Another way to soothe an itchy bite is by applying pressure for seconds

Diagnosis Moyamoya disease is usually diagnosed by a neurologist who specializes in the condition 
The specialist will review your symptoms and your family and medical history 
Several tests are generally needed to diagnose moyamoya disease and any underlying conditions 
An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain 
This type of test is called a magnetic resonance angiogram 
This type of imaging can measure the amount of blood passing through the vessels 
It can show the extent of reduction of blood supply to the brain 
But it may be helpful in identifying problems with blood vessels 
The provider then guides it to your brain using X ray imaging 
The provider injects dye through the catheter into the blood vessels of your brain 
Positron emission tomography PET scan or single photon emission computerized tomography SPECT 
In these tests, you re injected with a small amount of a safe radioactive material 
Children with moyamoya disease often have EEG results that aren t typical 
Specialists may use this test to evaluate blood flow in blood vessels in your neck 
If necessary, your neurologist may order other tests to rule out other conditions 
Health care providers evaluate your condition and determine the most appropriate treatment 
The goal of treatment is to reduce your symptoms and improve brain blood flow 
Treatment also aims to lower your risk of complications 
The prognosis for moyamoya disease depends on several factors, including 
Also known as calcium antagonists, this type of medicine may help manage headaches 
They also may help reduce symptoms related to transient ischemic attacks 
Anti seizure medicines These medicines could be helpful for those who have had seizures 
Early surgical treatment can help slow progression of moyamoya disease 
Your neurologist may recommend revascularization surgery if you develop symptoms or strokes 
In direct revascularization surgery, surgeons stitch the scalp artery directly to a brain artery 
This is also known as superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass surgery 
In EDAS, a surgeon separates a scalp artery over several inches 
The surgeon makes a small temporary opening on the skin to expose the artery 
Then the surgeon makes an opening in your skull directly beneath the artery 
The surgeon then replaces the bone and closes the opening in your skull 
In this procedure, your surgeon separates a muscle in the temple region of your forehead 
This can cause symptoms such as headaches, bleeding and seizures 
If this occurs, surgery may be necessary to prevent or treat a ruptured brain aneurysm 
Without surgery, moyamoya disease can cause cognitive decline due to narrowing blood vessels 
A psychiatrist may look for signs of problems with thinking and reasoning skills 
Physical and occupational therapy can help regain any lost physical function caused by a stroke 
Write down any symptoms you or your child has experienced 
Include any that may seem unrelated to the reason you scheduled the appointment 
Ask a family member to come with you to the appointment 
Someone who goes with you may remember something you missed or forgot

What to expect from your doctorYour care provider is likely to ask many questions, including 
Have you recently been sick or have you recovered from another illness 
In some cases, imaging tests or nerve tests may be needed 
It may help determine where in the brain the myoclonus originates 
These signals help determine the pattern and origin of the myoclonus 
Your health care provider may suggest genetic testing to help identify possible causes of myoclonus 
Most of the time, however, the underlying cause can t be cured or eliminated 
In these cases, treatment is aimed at reducing myoclonus symptoms, especially when they re disabling 
But treatments for other diseases may help relieve myoclonus symptoms 
More than one drug may be needed to control the symptoms 
Medicationsmedicines that health care providers commonly prescribe for myoclonus include 
Clonazepam Klonopin , a tranquilizer, is the most common drug used to treat myoclonus symptoms 
Clonazepam may cause side effects such as loss of coordination and drowsiness 
Drugs used to control epileptic seizures may help reduce myoclonus symptoms 
Levetiracetam may cause side effects such as fatigue and dizziness 
This treatment blocks the release of a chemical messenger that triggers muscle contractions 
People with myoclonus affecting parts of the face or ear also may benefit from surgery 
Deep brain stimulation has been tried in some people with myoclonus and other movement disorders 
The electrodes produce electrical signals to block the irregular impulses that can cause myoclonus 
Preparing for your appointmentYou ll probably first discuss your concerns with your primary care provider

A child who has nasal polyps might have cystic fibrosis 
A chemical put on the skin causes the area to sweat 
The test shows if the sweat is saltier than most people s sweat is 
Treatment Chronic sinusitis, with or without polyps, is hard to clear up 
Treatment depends on the cause of the swelling and irritation 
If so, taking steroids in pill form such as prednisone might help 
Steroids taken by mouth also might be given to shrink polyps before surgery 
The pills can be taken alone or with a nasal spray 
Steroids given as shots may be used if nasal polyps are severe 
These might be used for people whose nasal polyps keep coming back

An eye doctor can detect Lisch nodules, cataracts and visual loss 
Imaging tests are also often used to monitor NF and schwannomatosis 
However, some women choose genetic testing for SMARCB and LZTR before having children 
For a diagnosis of NF , you must have at least two signs of the condition 
A diagnosis of NF is usually made by age 
Treatment There isn t a cure for neurofibromatosis, but signs and symptoms can be managed 
MonitoringIf your child has NF , your doctor is likely to recommend yearly age appropriate checkups to 
Assess your child s skin for new neurofibromas or changes in existing ones 
Contact your doctor promptly if you notice any changes in signs or symptoms between visits 
Many complications of NF can be treated effectively if therapy starts early 
Complete removal of schwannomas in people with schwannomatosis can ease pain substantially 
This procedure delivers radiation precisely to your tumor and doesn t require an incision 
Stereotactic radiosurgery might be an option to remove acoustic neuromas if you have NF 
These devices might help improve your hearing if you have NF and hearing loss 
Early diagnosis and treatment are the most important factors contributing to a good outcome 
Pain medicationsManaging pain is an important part of treatment for schwannomatosis 
Drugs for nerve pain such as gabapentin Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant or pregabalin Lyrica

A neurologist examines the movements, muscle strength, coordination, sensation, memory, thinking, vision and speech 
This test helps in making an early diagnosis of NMO 
This test determines the levels of immune cells, proteins and antibodies in the fluid 
The spinal fluid might show very high white blood cells during NMO episodes 
This is greater than usually seen in MS, although this doesn t always happen 
Equipment attached to the electrodes records the brain s responses to stimuli 
NMO treatment involves therapies to reverse recent symptoms and prevent future attacks 
This process can remove harmful substances and cleanse the blood 
Diagnosis A doctor typically diagnoses Noonan syndrome after seeing some key signs 
Although there s no cure for Noonan syndrome, treatments can help decrease its effects 
The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment begins, the greater the benefits

Stronger muscles can help you stop the bladder from contracting on its own 
Your healthcare professional or a physical therapist can help you learn to do Kegel exercises 
How well they work depends on your doing them regularly 
It can take six weeks before they start to work 
Common side effects of most of these drugs include dry eyes and dry mouth

Constipation is another possible side effect that can make bladder symptoms worse 
Eating a fiber rich diet or using stool softeners might help prevent constipation 
Side effects from these shots include urinary tract infections and retaining urine 
Mild electrical pulses to the bladder nerves can improve overactive bladder symptoms 
This is like what a pacemaker does for the heart 
If the trial helps your symptoms, a battery powered pulse generator is put in with surgery 
The device stays in your body to help control the nerves 
There it connects with the nerves that control the bladder 
After that, treatments every to weeks help keep symptoms under control 
This procedure uses pieces of the bowel to replace a part of the bladder

The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight 
This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity 
But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits 
All weight loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active 
Dietary changesReducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are key to overcoming obesity 
It s also the best way to keep weight off permanently 
Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you 
The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in 
The first step is to review your typical eating and drinking habits 
You can see how many calories you usually consume and where you can cut back 
In contrast, fruits and vegetables provide a larger portion size with fewer calories 
To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant based foods 
If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week 
Drinking sugar sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended 
Limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories 
Then you have a healthy, balanced third meal that s low in fat and calories 
In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight 
But these diets likely won t teach you how to change your overall lifestyle 
You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss 
But the reality is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes 
Exercise and activityGetting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment 
For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator 
A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day 
Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal 
Weight loss medicines may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time 
Over time, eating and drinking less helps the average person lose weight 
In this procedure, you have a small balloon placed into the stomach 
Weight loss surgeryAlso known as bariatric surgery, weight loss surgery limits how much food you can eat 
Some procedures also limit the amount of calories and nutrients you can absorb 
But this also can result in nutritional and vitamin deficiencies 
In this surgery, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food 
The capsules are taken before meals and are passed through the intestines as stool 
This involves implanting a device under the skin in the stomach area 
This nerve tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full 
In this procedure, a tube is placed through the abdomen into the stomach 
A portion of the stomach contents are drained out after each meal 
You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan 
Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss 
You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches 
Get your family and friends on board with your weight loss goals 
Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts 
Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health 
You also might want to join a weight loss support group 
This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits 
You can discover things that may be holding you back 
The long term effectiveness and safety of these products are often questionable 
Coping and supportTalk to your health care professional or therapist about improving your coping skills 
Consider these tips to cope with obesity and your weight loss efforts 
Write in a journal to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions 
Try to participate in regular activities and get together with family or friends periodically 
Join a support group so that you can connect with others facing similar challenges 
Remind yourself that you re responsible for managing your condition and working toward your goals 
You also may be referred to a behavioral counselor or dietitian 
What you can doBeing an active participant in your care is important 
One way to do this is by preparing for your appointment 
What eating or activity habits are likely contributing to my health concerns and weight gain 
What can I do about the challenges I face in managing my weight 
Do I have other health problems that are caused by obesity 
Should I see a behavioral counselor with expertise in weight management 
What are the treatment options for obesity and my other health problems 
Is weight loss surgery or another intervention an option for me 
What life events may have been associated with weight gain 
What, when and how much do you eat in a typical day 
How much activity do you get in a typical day 
During what periods of your life did you gain weight 
What are the factors that you believe affect your weight 
What diets or treatments have you tried to lose weight 
Are you ready to make changes in your lifestyle to lose weight 
What do you think might prevent you from losing weight 
Include more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet 
Try to get up and move around your home more often 
Start gradually if you aren t in good shape or aren t used to exercising 
This helps determine whether your child s weight is a health concern 
In addition to BMI and charting weight on the growth charts, the doctor evaluates 
Your family s history of obesity and weight related health problems, such as diabetes 
Blood testsYour child s doctor might order blood tests that may include 
Other blood tests to check for hormone imbalances or other conditions associated with obesity 
Ask if your child needs to fast before a blood test and for how long 
Treatment usually includes changes in your child s eating habits and physical activity level 
In certain circumstances, treatment might include medications or weight loss surgery 
Success depends largely on your commitment to helping your child make these changes 
Even small changes can make a big difference in your child s health 
These drinks provide little nutritional value in exchange for their high calories 
They can also make your child feel too full to eat healthier foods 
Most of the menu options are high in fat and calories 
Make it an event a time to share news and tell stories 
And remember, when you eat out, restaurant portion sizes are often way too large 
Children younger than should have no screen time at all 
Children should be moderately to vigorously active for at least an hour a day 
However, as with any type of surgery, there are potential risks and long term complications 
And surgery doesn t replace the need for a healthy diet and regular physical activity 
Take advantage of every opportunity to build your child s self esteem 
Don t be afraid to bring up the topic of health and fitness 
Talk to your kids directly, openly, and without being critical or judgmental 
Negative talk about weight can lead to poor body image 
Instead, focus your conversation on healthy eating and positive body image 
Instead, encourage and support healthy eating and increased physical activity 
Celebrate small, incremental changes in behavior but don t reward with food 
Help your child find ways other than eating to deal with emotions

Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using specific medicines 
In cases that don t respond to treatment, other options may be offered 
DBS involves implanting electrodes within certain areas of your brain 
These electrodes produce electrical impulses that may help control impulses that aren t typical 
These devices are used when traditional treatment hasn t been effective 
During a TMS session, an electromagnetic coil is placed against your scalp near your forehead 
The coil delivers a magnetic pulse that stimulates nerve cells in your brain 
Work with your mental health professional to pinpoint methods to help manage symptoms 
You and your doctor may have pinpointed issues that can cause your OCD symptoms 
Learning about your condition can help you stick to your treatment plan

You may be referred to a sleep specialist for further evaluation 
The physical exam involves an examination of the back of your throat, mouth and nose 
The specialist can diagnose and determine the extent of your condition 
The evaluation might involve staying at a sleep center overnight 
At the sleep center, your breathing and other body functions are monitored as you sleep 
The equipment also measures arm and leg movements and blood oxygen levels 
You might be monitored all night or part of the night

The sleep study can uncover leg movements during sleep, known as periodic limb movement disorder 
Proper sizing is very important to comfort and performance of masks 
Here s a look at a few CPAP mask styles and some possible benefits of each 
Nasal pillows fit at the nares to supply air pressure 
You feel claustrophobic in masks that cover more of your face 
You want a full field of vision for reading or watching TV 
The mask covering the nose and mouth supplies air pressure 
You have nasal obstruction or congestion that makes breathing through your nose difficult 
If you have obstructive sleep apnea, you may benefit from positive airway pressure 
Positive airway pressure reduces the number of times you stop breathing as you sleep 
The therapy also reduces daytime sleepiness and improves your quality of life 
The most common type is called continuous positive airway pressure, also known as CPAP SEE pap 
The pressure of the air is just enough to keep your upper airway passages open 
However, newer machines are smaller and less noisy than older machines 
And there are a variety of mask designs for individual comfort 
You may need to try different types to find a suitable mask 
Several options are available, such as nasal masks, nasal pillows or face masks 
You might also benefit from using a humidifier along with your CPAP system 
CPAP may be given at a continuous pressure, known as fixed 
Or the pressure may be varied, known as autotitrating positive airway pressure APAP 
Bilevel positive airway pressure BPAP is another type of positive airway pressure 
People who have difficulty tolerating fixed CPAP might want to try BPAP or APAP 
Don t stop using your positive airway pressure machine if you have problems 
They re also used for people with severe sleep apnea who can t use CPAP 
The devices may reduce sleepiness and improve quality of life 
It s a removable device that you place around your tongue while you re awake 
It delivers electrical impulses to improve the muscle tone of the tongue 
This helps prevent the tongue from collapsing and blocking the airway during sleep 
Only a small number of studies has looked at how well these devices work 
Upper jaw advancement surgery involves moving the jaw to reduce the risk of obstruction 
When you inhale, the device stimulates the nerve that controls the movement of the tongue 
The tongue moves forward instead of moving backward and blocking the throat 
This enlarges the space behind the tongue and soft palate, making obstruction less likely

Surgery to remove the affected arm or leg, also called amputation 
Rarely a surgeon might remove the affected leg or arm to get all the cancer 
After surgery, an artificial arm or leg can be used 
Surgery to remove the lower portion of the leg, also called rotationplasty 
Rotationplasty might be an option for osteosarcoma in and around the knee joint

Experts also are unsure of what risks taking black cohosh poses 
Isoflavones are found in soybeans and other legumes and red clover 
Low risk complementary therapies that may help reduce stress and improve psychological well being include 
Research on acupuncture for decreasing hot flashes is inconclusive, but promising 
Preparing for your appointmentYou ll probably start by discussing your symptoms with your primary care provider 
Make a list of any signs and symptoms you re experiencing 
Include prescription and nonprescription drugs, herbs, vitamins and supplements that you re taking 
What medications, herbs, vitamins or other supplements do you take 
Your doctor will also conduct a physical and neurological examination 
If a nerve is injured but not cut, the injury is more likely to heal 
If your nerve is healing properly, you may not need surgery 
You may need to rest the affected area until it s healed 
Nerves recover slowly, and maximal recovery may take many months or several years 
You ll need regular checkups to make sure your recovery stays on track 
Medications used to treat depression, seizures or insomnia may be used to relieve nerve pain 
In some cases, you may need corticosteroid injections for pain relief 
Your doctor may recommend physical therapy to prevent stiffness and restore function 
Sometimes a section of a nerve is cut completely or damaged beyond repair 
Restoring functionA number of treatments can help restore function to the affected muscles 
Stimulators can activate muscle served by an injured nerve while the nerve regrows 
Your doctor will discuss electrical stimulation with you if it s an option 
Therapy involves specific movements or exercises to keep affected muscles and joints active 
Physical therapy can prevent stiffness and help restore function and feeling 
Children and adults with peripheral nerve injuries have several options for restoring lost function 
You may undergo a general physical exam and a neurological exam 
Several tests may help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms 
A CT scanner rotates around the body to take a series of images 
A computer uses the image to make a detailed view of the peripheral nerve tumor 
A CT scan can help your provider determine how the tumor may be affecting you 
For this test, small needles are placed in the muscles 
An instrument records the electrical activity in the muscle as they re moved 
It measures how fast the nerves carry electrical signals to the muscles 
If you have a nerve tumor, you may need a biopsy 
A small sample of cells from the tumor is removed and analyzed 
Sometimes a biopsy is the only way to determine whether a tumor is cancerous 
It s important to find a provider who is experienced in diagnosing and treating them 
More Information Peripheral nerve tumors care at CT scanElectromyography EMG MRIShow more related Information 
When that isn t possible, surgeons remove as much of the tumor as they can 
New methods and tools allow surgeons to reach tumors that are difficult to access 
And the function of nerves can be monitored during surgery, which helps preserve healthy tissue 
Stereotactic radiosurgery is used to treat some peripheral nerve tumors in or around the brain 
Radiation is delivered precisely to a tumor without making an incision 
One type of this kind of surgery is called Gamma Knife radiosurgery 
Risks of radiosurgery include weakness or numbness in the treated area 
Very rarely, the radiation could cause cancer in the treated area in the future 
Early diagnosis and treatment are the most important factors for a good outcome

Have your symptoms been constant or do they come and go 
If more tests are needed to confirm a diagnosis, your health care provider may suggest 
This is usually a sign of an infection or inflammation 
A culture of the fluid may be used to spot bacteria 
You ll also need to stay in the hospital for secondary peritonitis 
You ll likely take antibiotic medicine through a needle in a vein 
This clears out the infection and keeps it from spreading 
It depends on how serious your condition is and the kind of peritonitis you have 
Surgery is important if your peritonitis is due to a ruptured appendix, stomach or colon 
Depending on your symptoms, your treatment while in the hospital will likely include 
No single test can prove you have persistent post concussive symptoms 
If you re experiencing dizziness, you may be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist 
The types of symptoms and how often they occur varies from person to person 
They include some medicines to treat depression, high blood pressure and seizures 
Stress can make cognitive symptoms worse, so learning how to manage stress can be helpful 
Antidepressants or anti anxiety medicines may be prescribed to help manage anxiety or depression 
Preparing for your appointmentA primary care provider often makes the initial diagnosis of a concussion 
Or the diagnosis might be made by a health care provider in the emergency room 
Ask a family member or friend to go with you, if possible 
A friend or family member may remember something that you missed or forgot 
Preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your appointment 
For persistent post concussive symptoms, some basic questions to ask your provider include 
Do I need to do anything to prepare for the tests 
Are there any treatments available, and which do you recommend 
Are there any activity restrictions that I need to follow 
Is it OK to take medicines that were prescribed before the injury

It s possible to identify PKU carriers through a blood test 
A nurse or lab technician collects a few drops of blood from your baby s heel 
A laboratory tests the blood sample for certain metabolic disorders, including PKU 
If this test indicates that your baby may have PKU 
You and your baby may have genetic testing to identify the gene change for PKU 
A lifetime diet with very limited intake of foods with phenylalanine 
Your health care provider can determine a safe amount through 
Frequent blood tests that monitor blood phenylalanine levels, especially during childhood growth spurts and pregnancy 
Check with your pharmacist about the contents of nonprescription products and prescription medications 
Your health care provider and dietitian can help you find the right type of formula 
The drug may be used in combination with a PKU diet 
Each meal and snack includes the appropriately divided portion of your daily PKU formula 
Herbs and flavorings low in phenylalanine can have lots of flavor 
Just remember to measure and count every ingredient and adjust recipes to your specific diet 
Talk with your health care provider or dietitian if you have any questions 
Knowing the facts about PKU can help you take charge of the situation 
Discuss any questions with your pediatrician, family health care provider, geneticist or dietitian 
Read books and cookbooks specifically written for people with PKU 
Talking with others who have mastered similar challenges can be helpful

Raised levels of metanephrines are more common when a person has a pheochromocytoma 
In this test, you collect a urine sample every time you urinate over hours 
Ask for written directions about how to store, label and return the samples 
A healthcare professional takes a sample of blood to be tested in the lab 
Or you may be asked to skip taking a certain medicine 
Imaging testsIf the lab test results find signs of a pheochromocytoma, imaging tests are needed 
MRI, which uses radio waves and a magnetic field to make detailed images 
M iodobenzylguanidine MIBG imaging, a scan that can detect tiny amounts of an injected radioactive compound 
Information about possible genetic factors can be important for many reasons 
Some genetic conditions can cause more than one medical problem 
So, test results may suggest the need to screen for other medical conditions 
Some genetic conditions are more likely to happen again or be cancer 
So, your test results may affect treatment decisions or long term plans to track your health 
Genetic counseling can help you understand the results of your genetic testing 
The main treatment for a pheochromocytoma is surgery to remove the tumor 
Before you have surgery, your healthcare professional likely will prescribe certain blood pressure medicines 
These medicines will either replace or be added to other blood pressure medicines 
You also may be told to eat a high sodium diet 
This can cause dangerous drops in blood pressure when you stand up 
A high sodium diet can draw more fluid inside the blood vessels 
This helps prevent low blood pressure during and after surgery 
SurgeryMost often, a surgeon makes a few small cuts called incisions in the stomach area 
Often, the surgeon removes the entire adrenal gland that has the pheochromocytoma 
But the surgeon might remove only the tumor, leaving some healthy adrenal gland tissue 
This may be done when the other adrenal gland also has been removed 
Or it may be done when there are tumors in both adrenal glands 
Blood pressure usually returns to a healthy range after surgery 
You ll need regular checkups with your healthcare professional for the rest of your life 
These medicines replace certain hormones that the adrenal glands make 
Because of this, research about the best treatments is limited 
This treatment uses powerful drugs that kill fast growing cancer cells 
It may help ease symptoms in people with pheochromocytomas whose cancer has spread 
This treatment uses beams of intense energy to kill cancer cells 
It may relieve symptoms of tumors that have spread to the bone and cause pain 
This treatment can destroy cancer tumors with freezing temperatures, high energy radio waves or ethanol alcohol 
Then you might be referred to a specialist in hormonal conditions called an endocrinologist 
This person can help you remember the Information that your care team gives you 
All medicines, vitamins, herbs and other supplements you take, including doses 
Are there other treatment options aside from the main one you ve suggested 
What, if anything, appears to trigger your symptoms or make them worse 
Do you have a family history of adrenal tumors or other endocrine tumors

If your healthcare professional suspects a pinched nerve, you may need some tests 
You may need tests to measure your fasting blood glucose or thyroid levels 
They can reveal if there is narrowing or damage that could cause a pinched nerve 
Test results can show whether you have a damaged nerve 
During an EMG, a needle electrode is inserted through your skin into various muscles 
This test may be used if your healthcare professional suspects you have nerve root compression 
Ultrasound uses high frequency sound waves to produce images of structures within the body 
It s helpful for diagnosing nerve compression syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome 
The most frequently recommended treatment for a pinched nerve is rest for the affected area 
Stop any activities that cause the compression or make symptoms worse 
The physical therapist also may recommend that you modify activities that aggravate the nerve 
Anti seizure medicines such as gabapentin Neurontin, Horizant, Gralise may help nerve related pain 
Tricyclic medicines such as nortriptyline Pamelor and amitriptyline also may be used 
Corticosteroids, given by mouth or by injection, may help minimize pain and inflammation 
The type of surgery varies depending on the location of the pinched nerve 
Preparing for your appointmentYou re likely to first see your healthcare professional 
Include any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment 
For a suspected pinched nerve, some basic questions to ask include 
Is there an activity or a position that triggers your symptoms 
Is there an activity or a position that relieves your symptoms

SurgerySurgery to treat a pituitary tumor involves removing the tumor 
Lowers hormone levels in the body due to pressure on the pituitary gland 
Causes the body to make too much of some hormones 
Surgeries to remove a pituitary tumor include endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgery and craniotomy 
It s the most common surgery used to remove a pituitary adenoma 
The surgery doesn t require an external cut, also called an incision 
The surgery doesn t cause a scar that you can see 
Large macroadenomas may be hard to remove with this surgery 
It s used less often than endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary tumors 
Endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgery and transcranial surgery are generally safe procedures 
Diabetes insipidusSurgery to remove a pituitary tumor might damage the pituitary gland 
This condition happens when the pituitary gland cannot make enough of the hormone vasopressin 
That can cause extreme thirst and raise the risk of dehydration 
Diabetes insipidus after surgery to remove a pituitary tumor usually is short term 
It typically goes away without treatment within a few days 
The condition often goes away after several weeks or months 
Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high energy sources of radiation to treat pituitary tumors 
Or it can be used alone if surgery isn t an option 
Methods of radiation therapy that can be used to treat pituitary tumors include 
Although the word surgery is in its name, no cut into the skin is needed 
Little radiation comes in contact with healthy tissue near the tumor 
That lowers the risk of damage to the healthy tissue 
That lowers the risk of side effects on healthy tissue 
Another radiation option, proton beam therapy uses positively charged ions, called protons, to target tumors 
Proton beams stop after releasing their energy within the tumor 
Potential side effects and complications of radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas can include 
Damage to the pituitary gland that limits its ability to make hormones 
Side effects and complications from radiation therapy usually don t show up right away either 
MedicationsTreatment with medications can be useful for the management of pituitary adenomas 
They can help lower the amount of hormones the body makes due to a tumor 
Some medications also can shrink certain types of pituitary tumors 
Some people develop compulsive behaviors, such as problems with gambling, while taking these medications 
Medications that can lower the amount of cortisol the body makes include 
Mifepristone doesn t lower the amount of cortisol the body makes 
Instead, it blocks the effects of cortisol on the body s tissues 
The medication pasireotide Signifor works by lowering the amount of ACTH a pituitary adenoma makes 
Providers typically suggest pasireotide when surgery to remove an adenoma doesn t work 
It also may be used when an adenoma can t be removed with surgery 
This type of medication lowers the amount of growth hormone that the body makes 
These medications are given as a shot, usually every four weeks 
This medication blocks the effect of too much growth hormone on the body 
This medication may cause the side effect of liver damage in some people 
This is because of the hormone changes they can cause 
If your hormones fall to unhealthy levels, you may need to take hormone replacement therapy

Have you had imaging tests done of your head for any reason in the past 
During an ultrasound, a wandlike device called a transducer is placed on your body 
It emits sound waves that are reflected back to the transducer like sonar 
A computer translates the reflected sound waves into images of your kidneys 
Your doctor is able to see cross sectional images of your kidneys 
Often, people with PKD reach end stage kidney disease between ages to 
Tolvaptan therapy may be recommended for adults at risk of rapidly progressive ADPKD 
However, medications are usually needed to control high blood pressure 
For some people, however, the pain is more severe and constant 
Prompt treatment of infections with antibiotics is necessary to prevent kidney damage 
For more complicated infections, you may need to take a longer course of antibiotics 
Dilution might help prevent obstructive clots from forming in your urinary tract 
In most cases, the bleeding will stop on its own

You may be referred to a specialist in urinary and reproductive system disorders urologist 
Test for diagnosing bacterial infectionsDiagnostic tests to assess for infection will likely include 
Blood samples may be tested for signs of infection and other prostate problems 
A urine sample after the massage expels the prostate fluid for bacterial testing 
Other testsIf initial tests show no sign of infection, you may undergo other tests, including 
These tests can help characterize problems with urinating and identify the source of problems 
Treating infectionIf you have acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis, you ll take antibiotics 
Acute disease may require intravenous IV antibiotics in the hospital for a short period 
This treatment might ease urinary symptoms, such as painful or difficult urination 
Lifestyle and home remediesThe following remedies might ease some symptoms of prostatitis 
Soak in a warm bath sitz bath or use a heating pad 
Limit or avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spicy or acidic foods, which can irritate your bladder 
This will cause you to urinate more and help flush bacteria from your bladder 
Alternative medicine Alternative therapies that show some promise for reducing symptoms of prostatitis include 
There is insufficient evidence for other herbal remedies for treating pain associated with prostatitis 
Discuss your use of alternative medicine practices and herbal treatments with your doctor 
Are your symptoms constant, or do they come and go 
Do you have difficulty urinating, such as dribbling or hesitant urination 
How often do you need to urinate in the night 
Have you been diagnosed with bacterial prostatitis or a urinary tract infection in the past 
Did you take all of the pills for that infection 
What medications, dietary supplements, herbal products and vitamins do you take 
MedicationsIf over the counter pain relievers aren t enough, your health care provider may suggest 
NSAIDs can cause stomach bleeding and decreased kidney function, especially in older adults 
Low dose pills of this gout drug are also effective for pseudogout 
Long term use of corticosteroids can weaken bones and cause cataracts, diabetes and weight gain 
The process also helps remove some of the crystals from the joint 
The joint is then injected with a numbing medication and a corticosteroid to decrease inflammation 
Lifestyle and home remediesHome treatments may be useful during pseudogout flare ups 
Try not to use the affected joint for a couple of days 
Cold packs can help reduce the inflammation associated with flare ups 
Preparing for your appointmentYou ll probably first see your family health care provider 
Does any activity or position make your joint feel better or worse 
This helps determine the type of psoriasis and rule out other disorders 
Options include creams and ointments topical therapy , light therapy phototherapy , and oral or injected medications 
These drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating mild to moderate psoriasis 
They are available as oils, ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, sprays and shampoos 
Long term use or overuse of strong corticosteroids can thin the skin 
This type of drug may be used alone or with topical corticosteroids 
Calcipotriene and calcitriol are usually more expensive than topical corticosteroids 
Tazarotene Tazorac, Avage, others is available as a gel or cream 
The most common side effects are skin irritation and increased sensitivity to light 
Tazarotene isn t recommended when you re pregnant or breastfeeding or if you intend to become pregnant 
Salicylic acid shampoos and scalp solutions reduce the scaling of scalp psoriasis 
It comes in various forms, such as shampoo, cream and oil 
They re also messy, stain clothing and bedding, and can have a strong odor 
Coal tar treatment isn t recommended when you re pregnant or breastfeeding 
Anthralin is a tar cream that slows skin cell growth 
It s not intended for use on the face or genitals 
Anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches 
It s usually applied for a short time and then washed off 
It involves exposing the skin to controlled amounts of natural or artificial light 
Talk with your health care provider about whether home phototherapy is an option for you 
An approach that combines coal tar treatment with light therapy is called the Goeckerman therapy 
UVB narrowband light therapy might be more effective than UVB broadband treatment 
But narrowband UVB phototherapy may cause more severe side effects than UVB broadband 
This more aggressive treatment consistently improves skin and is often used for more severe psoriasis 
Short term side effects might include nausea, headache, burning and itching 
With this form of light therapy, a strong UVB light targets only the affected skin 
Acitretin and other retinoids are pills used to reduce the production of skin cells 
Three of them etanercept, ixekizumab and ustekinumab are approved for children 
It might cause upset stomach, loss of appetite and fatigue 
People taking methotrexate long term need ongoing testing to monitor their blood counts and liver function 
People need to stop taking methotrexate at least three months before attempting to conceive 
This drug is not recommended for those who are breastfeeding 
Taken orally for severe psoriasis, cyclosporine Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune suppresses the immune system 
People taking cyclosporine long term need ongoing testing to monitor their blood pressure and kidney function 
Talk with your health care provider about possible side effects of these drugs 
You ll likely start with the mildest treatments topical creams and ultraviolet light therapy phototherapy 
Then, if your condition doesn t improve, you might move on to stronger treatments 
People with pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis usually need to start with stronger systemic medications 
Lifestyle and home remediesTry these self care measures to better manage your psoriasis 
Wash gently rather than scrubbing your skin in the shower or bath 
Use lukewarm water and mild soaps that have added oils or fats 
If moisturizing seems to improve your skin, apply the product more than once a day 
When you wake, remove the plastic and wash away scales 
If you have scalp psoriasis, try a medicated shampoo that contains coal tar 
Keep your nails trimmed so that they won t hurt your skin if you do scratch 
Notice what triggers your psoriasis, and take steps to prevent or avoid it 
Infections, injuries to your skin, smoking and intense sun exposure can all worsen psoriasis 
If you have air conditioning, use it on hot days to keep cool 
Here are some ways to help you live with psoriasis and feel more in control 
Find out as much as you can about the disease, and research your treatment options 
Understand possible triggers of the disease so that you can better prevent flare ups 
Try to adhere to medical advice about treatment and lifestyle changes 
Consider joining a support group of people who have the disease 
Some people find comfort in sharing their experiences and meeting people who face similar challenges 
The relationship between stress and psoriasis is unclear and needs further study 
Consider meditation, tai chi, yoga, and spending time with friends and loved ones 
In some cases, you may be referred directly to a specialist in skin diseases dermatologist 
Will the treatment you recommended cause a remission in my symptoms 
What skin care routines and products do you recommend to improve my symptoms 
Sticky patches called electrodes are put on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs 
An echocardiogram is usually the main test to diagnose pulmonary atresia 
The test can provide detailed Information on blood flow and how the heart works 
More Information Pulmonary atresia care at Cardiac catheterizationEchocardiogramElectrocardiogram ECG or EKG X rayShow more related Information 
Treatment Babies need emergency medical care for pulmonary atresia symptoms 
The choice of surgeries or procedures depends on how severe the condition is 
Medicationsmedicine may be given through an IV to keep the ductus arteriosus open 
This hole, called the foramen ovale, most often closes soon after birth 
Babies with pulmonary atresia often need many heart surgeries over time 
This involves making a new route for blood to flow, called a bypass shunt 
But most babies outgrow this shunt within a few months 
Another large vein keeps blood flowing to the right side of the heart 
The heart then pumps it through the pulmonary valve that s been repaired 
In some cases, the heart is too damaged to fix 
Then the surgeon makes a connection from the right pumping chamber to the pulmonary artery 
A person born with pulmonary atresia needs regular checkups, even as an adult 
A doctor trained in congenital heart diseases, called a congenital cardiologist, often provides care 
Some children with a congenital heart defect may need to limit exercise or sports activities 
Brushing and flossing teeth and getting regular dental checkups can help prevent infection 
Ask a member of your child s care team about local support groups 
For instance, you might need to fill out forms or restrict your child s diet 
This person can help you remember the details you re given 
Your child s symptoms, including ones that don t seem linked to pulmonary atresia 
All medicines, vitamins, or supplements that your child takes and the doses 
Can you suggest a specialist who treats congenital heart defects 
Be sure to ask all the questions you have about your child s condition 
What to expect from your child s doctorBe ready to answer questions, such as 
Does your child always have symptoms or do the symptoms come and go 
Diagnosis Your baby s health care provider will start with a physical examination 
Sometimes, the provider can feel an olive shaped lump when examining the baby s belly 
Blood tests to check for dehydration or electrolyte imbalance or both 
Ultrasound to view the pylorus and confirm a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis 
X rays of your baby s digestive system, if results of the ultrasound aren t clear 
The procedure, called a pyloromyotomy, is often scheduled on the same day as the diagnosis 
If your baby is dehydrated or has an electrolyte imbalance, your baby receives fluids 
This opens a channel for food to pass through to the small intestine 
Recovery from a laparoscopic procedure is usually quicker than recovery from traditional surgery 
Your baby might be given intravenous fluids for a few hours 
You can start feeding your baby again within to hours 
Possible complications from pyloric stenosis surgery include bleeding and infection 
However, complications aren t common, and the results of surgery are generally excellent 
What to expect from your doctorYour provider is likely to ask you a few questions 
Does your baby have four or more wet diapers a day 
These may include blood tests, a skin biopsy and other tests 
Your doctor may refer you to a specialist in skin conditions dermatologist 
Some people respond well to treatment with a combination of pills, creams or injections 
Even after successful treatment, it s common for new wounds to develop 
Using corticosteroids for a long time or in high doses may cause serious side effects 
Because of this your doctor may prescribe steroid sparing nonsteroidal drugs if you need long term treatment 
You may be asked to keep the affected area elevated 
Trauma to the skin may worsen existing ulcers or trigger new ones 
You may feel depressed if the process takes a long time and is painful 
Preparing for your appointmentYou may start by seeing your primary care physician 
Or you may be referred immediately to a doctor who specializes in skin conditions dermatologist 
Treatment Radiation enteritis treatment usually involves managing symptoms until they go away 
This condition causes irritation of the intestines after radiation therapy for cancer 
If radiation enteritis lasts longer, you might need a feeding tube 
Sometimes, surgery is used to bypass the part of the intestine that s irritated 
A thorough physical exam, medical history and testing are required to diagnose tachycardia 
Sensors, called electrodes, are placed on the chest to record the heart s electrical signals 
A Holter monitor is a small, wearable device that continuously checks the heartbeat 
The device is typically worn for a day or more during daily activities 
A coronary angiogram can show blocked or narrowed blood vessels in the heart 
Ask your care team if this is an option for you 
Some devices automatically record when an irregular heart rhythm is noticed 
It s most often done to find a cause of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation 
It may be done to find the cause of ventricular tachycardia 
It uses a dye and special X rays to show the inside of the coronary arteries 
This test may be done to confirm a diagnosis of tachycardia 
It can help find where in the heart the incorrect signaling occurs 
Sensors on the tips of the tubes record the heart s electrical signals 
Stress tests are done to see how exercise affects the heart 
This test may be done to learn if a fast heartbeat leads to fainting 
Then, under careful supervision, the table is tilted to a standing position 
More Information Tachycardia care at Electrocardiogram ECG or EKG EP studyHolter monitorTilt table testShow 
Slowing a fast heart rateA fast heart rate may correct itself 
But sometimes medicine or other treatments are needed to slow down the heartbeat 
This may involve medicines, implanted devices, or heart surgeries or procedures 
medicines medicines are often used to control the heart rate 
This battery powered device is placed under the skin near the collarbone 
So the maze can block stray electrical heart signals that cause some types of tachycardia 
Sometimes open heart surgery is needed to destroy an extra electrical pathway causing tachycardia 
Your care team also may suggest that you limit or avoid caffeine 
Alternative medicinestress relief techniques, such as meditation and yoga, might help slow the heartbeat 
When and how to do treatments called vagal maneuvers, if appropriate 
You also might see a doctor trained in heart rhythm disorders, called an electrophysiologist 
There s often a lot to discuss at a health checkup 
Any symptoms, including those that may seem unrelated to your heart 
Include vitamins, supplements and medicines bought with or without a prescription 
Do I need to avoid or stop doing any activities 
What to expect from your doctorYour healthcare team is likely to ask you many questions 
How often do you have episodes of a fast heartbeat 
Does anything, such as exercise, stress or caffeine, make your symptoms worse 
Does anyone in your family have heart disease or a history of irregular heart rhythms 
Has anyone in your family had cardiac arrest or died suddenly 
How much alcohol or caffeine do you use, if any 
Do you have any conditions that may affect your heart health 
For example, are you being treated for high blood pressure or high cholesterol 
TestsA test called nailfold capillaroscopy can tell the difference between primary and secondary Raynaud s 
A positive test result often means that your immune system is mistakenly attacking body tissue 
A faster than typical rate might signal an inflammatory or autoimmune disease 
medicines used to treat people with Raynaud s disease may include 
These drugs relax and open small blood vessels in the hands and feet 
These drugs also can help heal sores on fingers or toes 
Surgeries and medical proceduresSurgery or shots might be needed to treat severe Raynaud s 
Nerves in the hands and feet control opening and narrowing of blood vessels in skin 
This surgery, if successful, might lead to fewer and shorter attacks 
Shots of numbing medicines or onabotulinumtoxinA Botox can block nerves in affected hands or feet 
Some people need to have this more than once if symptoms remain or return 
Lifestyle and home remediesYou take steps to decrease Raynaud s attacks and help you feel better 
Smoking, vaping or breathing in someone else s smoke tightens blood vessels 
Try not to go quickly from heat to air conditioning 
What to do during an attackWarm your hands, feet or other affected areas 
Do the following to gently warm your fingers and toes

If stress triggers an attack, get away from the stress and relax 
Warm your hands or feet in water to help lessen the attack 
If you re interested, talk to your health care provider about 
Ginkgo supplements could help lessen the number of Raynaud s attacks 
This practice seems to improve blood flow, so it may help Raynaud s attacks 
Using the mind to control body temperature might help Raynaud s 
Talk to your provider if you re thinking of trying alternative treatments 
Your provider can warn you if there are possible side effects 
This type of health care provider is called a rheumatologist 
Your symptoms, when they began and what seems to trigger them 
Other medical conditions you and your family have, particularly connective tissue or autoimmune disorders 
How can I reduce the risk of a Raynaud s attack 
Has anyone else in your family been diagnosed with Raynaud s 
What do you do for a living and for recreation 
Diagnosis Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between rectal prolapse and hemorrhoids 
A small balloon at the tip of the tube may be blown up 
Treatment Treatment for rectal prolapse often involves surgery 
Treatment for constipation with stool softeners, suppositories and other medicines are often needed 
Your provider may suggest certain tests depending on your needs 
The tissue sample is sent to a lab to look at the cells 
Tests for identifying fistulasMost commonly, a rectovaginal fistula is easily seen during a pelvic exam 
If a fistula is not found during the exam, you may need tests 
The CT scan can help locate a fistula and determine its cause 
This test creates images of soft tissues in your body 
During the procedure, small samples of tissue may be collected for lab analysis 
Samples can help tell if you have Crohn s disease or other inflammatory bowel conditions 
More Information Barium enemaColonoscopyComputerized tomography CT urogramCT scanMRINeedle biopsyShow more related Information 
It also gives time to see if the fistula closes on its own 
You may take antibiotics if you have Crohn s disease and develop a fistula 
Infliximab Remicade can help reduce inflammation and heal fistulas caused by Crohn s disease 
SurgeryIn most cases, surgery is needed to close or repair a rectovaginal fistula 
The fistula tunnel is removed, and the anal and vaginal tissues are repaired 
The surgeon removes the fistula and creates a flap out of nearby healthy tissue 
Doing a colostomy before repairing a fistula in complex or recurrent cases 
A cancerous tumor, or an abscess also may require a colostomy 
If a colostomy is needed, your surgeon may wait to months 
Vaginal douches can make an infection more likely, so they re not recommended 
Pre moistened, alcohol free, unscented towelettes or wipes or moistened cotton balls are a good option instead 
For best results, be sure to follow any other instructions from your health care team 
After your initial evaluation, you may be referred to a surgeon to discuss treatment options 
Include any that may seem unrelated to a rectovaginal fistula 
What do I need to do to prepare for the tests

What treatments are available to me at this stage, and which do you recommend 
Has there been a change in the symptoms over time 
Do these symptoms feel different from when you were first diagnosed with cancer 
A urine test can reveal whether your child has a UTI 
This imaging method uses high frequency sound waves to produce images of the kidney and bladder 
The scanner detects the tracer and shows whether the urinary tract is functioning correctly 
Risks include discomfort from the catheter and discomfort during urination 
Grading the conditionAfter testing, doctors grade the degree of reflux 
In the mildest cases, urine backs up only to the ureter grade I 
Children with mild cases of primary vesicoureteral reflux may eventually outgrow the disorder 
In this case, your doctor may recommend a wait and see approach 
MedicationsUTIs require prompt treatment with antibiotics to keep the infection from moving to the kidneys 
A defect in the valve keeps it from closing and preventing urine from flowing backward 
Advantages include smaller incisions and possibly less bladder spasms than open surgery 
The procedure was also associated with a longer operating time, but a shorter hospital stay 
This procedure also requires general anesthesia, but generally can be performed as outpatient surgery 
pediatric urologists emphasize a thorough medical history and exam to fit each patient and family 
has a state of the art pelvic floor rehabilitation and biofeedback program to help cure these conditions 
But you can take steps to ease your child s discomfort until antibiotics clear the infection 
Drinking water dilutes urine and may help flush out bacteria 
Provide a heating pad or a warm blanket or towel 
Avoiding constipation and emptying the bladder every two hours while awake may help 
What you can doBefore your appointment, take time to write down key Information, including 
Signs and symptoms your child has been experiencing, and for how long 
Information about your child s medical history, including other recent health problems 
Names and dosages of any prescription and over the counter medications that your child is taking 
For vesicoureteral reflux, some basic questions to ask your child s doctor include 
What s the most likely cause of my child s signs and symptoms 
Are there other possible causes, such as a bladder or kidney infection 
How likely is it that my child s condition will get better without treatment 
What are the benefits and risks of the recommended treatment in my child s case 
Is my child at risk of complications from this condition 
What steps can I take to reduce my child s risk of future urinary tract infections 
Are my other children at increased risk of this condition 
Don t hesitate to ask additional questions that occur to you during your child s appointment 
He or she is likely to ask you a number of questions as well 
When did you first notice that your child was experiencing symptoms 
Have these symptoms been continuous or do they come and go 
Does anyone in your family have a history of vesicoureteral reflux 
What types of antibiotics has your child received for other infections, such as ear infections 
Doctors may recommend an overnight study in a sleep lab 
Typically, you ll be videotaped to document your behavior during REM sleep cycles 
For a diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder, criteria include the following 
If you awaken during the episode, you are alert and not confused or disoriented 
A sleep study polysomnogram shows you have increased muscle activity during REM sleep 
Removing dangerous objects from the bedroom, such as sharp items and weapons 
MedicationsExamples of treatment options for REM sleep behavior disorder include 
Melatonin may be as effective as clonazepam and is usually well tolerated with few side effects 
Doctors continue to study several other medications that may treat REM sleep behavior disorder 
Talk with your doctor to determine the most appropriate treatment option for you

Consider bringing your sleeping partner, a family member or friend along, if possible 
If you have a sleeping partner, what sleep behavior has he or she observed 
Have you or your sleeping partner ever been injured by your sleep behaviors 
In addition to your dream enacting behaviors, have you ever experienced sleepwalking 
Diagnosis For diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, your health care provider may start with 
Blood and urine tests to measure the levels of hormones that regulate blood pressure 
Imaging tests commonly done to diagnose renal artery stenosis include 
High frequency sound waves help your doctor see the arteries and kidneys and check their function 
You may receive a dye injection to show blood flow 
A dye injection into the arteries outlines blood vessels during imaging 
Depending on your overall health and symptoms, you may not need any specific treatment 
Finding the right medication or combination of medications may require time and patience 
Some medications commonly used to treat high blood pressure associated with renal artery stenosis include 
Diuretics, also known as water pills, which help your body eliminate excess sodium and water 
Which medications are best for you depends on your individual situation 
If you re overweight, losing weight may help to lower your blood pressure 
Salt and salty foods cause your body to retain fluid 
This may increase the volume of your blood and, in turn, increase your blood pressure 
Tobacco injures blood vessel walls and speeds up the process of hardening of the arteries

Tests and procedures used to diagnose residual limb pain may include 
He or she will also look for signs of infection and masses 
These tests may identify fractures, bone bruises and other bone abnormalities, tumors, and infection 
In about half of people with residual limb pain, the pain eventually improves without treatment 
Treatment options for residual limb pain may involve medications, including 
It s thought that these drugs interfere with the transmission of nerve signals to reduce pain 
These drugs, including ketamine, block events that increase sensitivity in the neurons 
They re usually given as topical medications applied to your skin 
While they re very effective in reducing pain, the benefits don t last very long 
Wearing compression garments on the residual limb may also help 
These injections block or turn off a nerve s pain signals 
These treatments use electrical stimulation on a nerve to relieve pain 
You have a strong, often irresistible urge to move the legs 
Your symptoms start or get worse when you re resting, such as sitting or lying down 
Your symptoms are partially or temporarily relieved by activity, such as walking or stretching 
Symptoms can t be explained solely by another medical or behavioral condition 
Your healthcare professional may conduct a physical and a neurological exam 
However, a diagnosis of RLS usually doesn t require a sleep study 
Correcting an iron deficiency may involve taking an iron supplement by mouth 
Or you may be given an iron supplement through a vein in your arm 
Take iron supplements only with medical supervision and after having your blood iron level checked 
If you have RLS without an associated condition, treatment focuses on lifestyle changes 
If those aren t effective, your healthcare professional may prescribe medicines 
MedicationsSeveral prescription medicines are available to reduce the restlessness in the legs 
These medicines affect levels of the chemical messenger dopamine in the brain 
Short term side effects of these medicines are usually mild and include nausea, lightheadedness and fatigue 
However, they also can cause issues with impulse control, such as compulsive gambling 
Sometimes dopamine medicines that have worked for a while to relieve RLS stop working 
Or you may notice your symptoms return earlier in the day or involve your arms 
If this happens, your healthcare professional may substitute another medicine 
But healthcare professionals don t recommend taking this medicine daily or near daily 
Daily use of this medicine can cause augmentation 
These medicines may only be used if no other treatment provides relief 
Some examples include tramadol ConZip, Qdolo , codeine, oxycodone Oxycontin, Roxicodone, others and hydrocodone Hysingla ER

The following tests may be done to find the location and extent of the disease 
You ll be asked if the lines of the grid seem faded, broken or distorted 
This test is an excellent technique for capturing precise images of the retina 
This can help diagnose epiretinal membranes, macular holes and macular swelling, called edema 
FAF may be used to determine the stage of retinal diseases, including macular degeneration 
FAF highlights a retinal pigment, called lipofuscin, that increases with retinal damage or dysfunction 
This test uses a dye that lights up when exposed to infrared light 
A scleral buckle is sometimes used in the management of retinal detachment 
In many cases, damage that has already happened can t be reversed, making early detection important 
Your eye doctor will work with you to decide on the best treatment 
Treatment of retinal disease may be complex and sometimes urgent 
Your surgeon uses a laser to heat small pinpoints on the retina 
This creates scarring that usually binds the retina to the underlying tissue 
Intense cold reaches the inside of the eye and freezes the retina 
The treated area will later scar and secure the retina to the eye wall 
It can be used in combination with cryopexy or laser photocoagulation 
This surgery, called scleral SKLAIR ul buckling, is used to repair a retinal detachment 
Air, gas or liquid is then injected into the space 
Your eye doctor may suggest injecting medicine into the vitreous in the eye 
Such devices include hand held lenses or magnifying lenses you wear like glasses 
Adjust the font size and monitor contrast in your computer s settings 
Consider adding speech output systems or other technologies to your computer 
Try talking watches, clocks and calculators large print books tablet computers and audio books 
And many of these devices now come with a voice recognition feature 
Use public transportation or ask a friend or family member to help 
Make arrangements to use local van or shuttle services, volunteer driving networks, or ride shares 
Preparing for your appointmentTo check for retinal disease, a dilated eye exam is usually necessary 
Your son may be lying down, sitting or standing during this examination 
These positions make it easier to find and manipulate the testicle 
Treatment Retractile testicles don t require surgery or other treatment 
A retractile testicle is likely to descend on its own before or during puberty 
Help him practice a response if he s teased or asked about the condition 
Preparing for your appointmentA primary healthcare professional usually can diagnose a retractile testicle 
Were both testicles previously identified as descended in a well baby or annual exam 
When did you notice the absence of the testicle in the scrotum 
Has your child experienced any pain in his testicles or groin 
Has your son experienced any trauma to his genitals or groin 
It also may include testing for fatty acid oxidation disorders and other disorders 
A spinal tap can help identify or rule out other diseases with similar symptoms 
Or it can help diagnose inflammation or an infection of the brain, called encephalitis 
A small sample of liver tissue is removed and sent to a lab for analysis 
These tests may show swelling in the brain, which may be caused by Reye s syndrome

Treatment Reye s syndrome is usually treated in the hospital 
Severe cases may be treated in the intensive care unit 
The hospital staff will closely monitor your child s blood pressure and other vital signs 
These medicines may be used to decrease pressure from fluids around the brain 
Bleeding due to liver problems may require treatment with vitamin K, plasma and platelets 
These blankets help maintain internal body temperature at a safe level 
A breathing machine called a ventilator can help if your child has trouble breathing 
Preparing for your appointmentReye s syndrome is often diagnosed in an emergency situation 
In some cases, early symptoms prompt an appointment with a health care provider 
Even better, take the original bottles and a written list of the dosages and directions 
The person who accompanies you may remember something that you forgot or missed 
What are the treatment options and the pluses and minuses for each 
Based on the results, the healthcare team might recommend other tests 
They might help show the location and size of a rhabdomyosarcoma 
Experienced healthcare teams will select the best type of biopsy 
Sometimes, surgery might be needed to remove a larger sample of tissue 
Doctors who study blood and body tissue, called pathologists, will test the cells for cancer 
Treatment Rhabdomyosarcoma treatment most often combines chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy 
But that s not always possible if the rhabdomyosarcoma has grown around or near organs 
For rhabdomyosarcoma, chemotherapy is often used after surgery or radiation therapy 
It can help kill cancer cells that might be left 
Ask your healthcare professional if you might be able to be in a clinical trial 
Coping and supportA diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma can bring up many feelings 
Ask your healthcare professional about this type of sarcoma, including treatment options 
Examples are pediatric surgeons, head and neck surgeons, gynecologists or urologists 
Specialists who study tissue to find the type of cancer, called pathologists 
Whether the appointment is for you or for your child, your questions might include 
What are the side effects and risks of each treatment 
What to expect from your doctorYour healthcare professional will likely ask you questions 
Blood tests can be done to check for signs of inflammation in the body 
Another blood test can be done to look for proteins related to the strep bacteria 
A healthcare professional can check ECG signal patterns for signs of heart swelling 
An echocardiogram shows the structure of the heart and how blood flows through it

Diagnosis There s no single test to confirm a diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome ME CFS 
During a high density EEG test, flat metal discs called electrodes are attached to the scalp 
In a high density EEG, shown here, the electrodes are close together 
The electrodes are connected to the EEG machine with wires 
After a seizure, see a healthcare professional to thoroughly review your symptoms and medical history 
You may need several tests to determine the cause of your seizure 
The tests can evaluate how likely it is that you ll have another one 
You may have a test of your behavior, motor abilities and mental function 
This helps determine if there s a health issue with your brain and nervous system 
This shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording 
EEG testing also may help exclude other conditions that could cause a seizure 
This can help determine what may be causing the seizures 
PET scans use a small amount of low dose radioactive material that s injected into a vein 
This can help a healthcare professional see where seizures are occurring 
This can compare blood flow during a seizure to blood flow in between seizures 
Treatment Not everyone who has one seizure has another one 
Treatment usually involves the use of anti seizure medicines 
MedicationsMany medicines are used in the treatment of epilepsy and seizures, including 
Finding the right medicine and dosage can be challenging 
A healthcare professional likely will first prescribe a single drug at a relatively low dosage 
The healthcare professional then may increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well controlled 
Many people with epilepsy are able to prevent seizures with just one drug 
To achieve the best seizure control possible, take medicines exactly as prescribed 
This includes prescription medicines, medicines available without a prescription or herbal remedies 
And never stop taking your medicine without talking to a healthcare professional 
Discoloration of the skin or eyes such as a yellowing 
The disease is similar to bacterial meningitis but isn t caused by bacteria 
Always talk to your healthcare professional before stopping these medicines 
When anti seizure medicines aren t effective, other treatments may be an option 
The goal of surgery is to stop seizures from happening 
Surgeons locate and remove the area of your brain where seizures begin 
The device can deliver an electrical stimulation to the detected area to stop the seizure 
For this therapy, a surgeon implants electrodes within certain areas of the brain 
The electrodes attach to a pacemaker like device placed under the skin of your chest 
Variations on a ketogenic diet are less effective but may provide benefit 
They include the low glycemic index diet and modified Atkins diet 
Pregnancy and seizuresWomen who ve had previous seizures usually are able to have healthy pregnancies 
It s especially important to avoid valproic acid during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible 
Preconception planning is particularly important for women who ve had seizures

During a high density EEG test, electrodes are placed on your scalp closely spaced together 
After a seizure, your health care provider typically reviews your symptoms and medical history 
Your provider may order several tests to determine the cause of your seizure 
This helps evaluate how likely it is that you ll have another seizure 
Your health care provider may test your behavior, motor abilities and mental function 
This can let your provider know about the health of your brain and nervous system 
An EEG also can help rule out other conditions that look like epilepsy 
CT scans can reveal what may be causing your seizures 
Your health care provider may be able to detect what could be causing seizures 
PET scans can uncover areas of the brain where the seizure began 
A SPECT test uses a small amount of low dose radioactive tracer 
However, many people don t achieve seizure control with medicines alone 
Discuss possible side effects with your health care provider when considering treatment options 
Also ask what effect your seizure medicines may have on other medicines you take 
Some anti seizure medicines can make oral contraceptives less effective, for example 
With vagus nerve stimulation, you may still need to take medicine 
The device then delivers an electrical stimulation to the area to stop the seizure 
The electrodes produce electrical impulses that regulate brain activity to stop seizures 
The diet is high in fat and low in carbohydrates 
It can be hard to follow because the diet is restrictive 
Variations on a ketogenic diet also may provide some benefit but are less effective 
They include the low glycemic index and modified Atkins diets 
Pregnancy and seizuresWomen who ve had previous seizures typically are able to have healthy pregnancies 
But it s important to know that certain medicines can lead to birth defects 
Valproic acid is one possible medicine for generalized seizures 
Ask if other forms of contraception need to be considered 
Don t adjust the dosage before talking to your health care provider 
Coping and supportEven after they re under control, seizures can affect your life 
Temporal lobe seizures may present even more of a coping challenge 
This is because people may not recognize some of its symptoms as a seizure 
Children may get teased or be embarrassed by their condition 
And living with the constant threat of another seizure may frustrate children and adults 
You can widen your support system and bring about acceptance and understanding 
Ask your health care provider about local support groups or join an online support community 
You also might be referred to a neurologist trained in epilepsy, known as an epileptologist

The electrical activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording 
EEG testing also may help exclude other conditions that mimic epilepsy 
An MRI may show changes in the brain that could lead to seizures 
CT scans can reveal changes in your brain that might cause a seizure 
The material helps reveal active areas of the brain and detect changes 
This test is usually done in a hospital with overnight EEG recording 
Before your exam, it s very important to fill out the safety screening form carefully 
Fillings, bridges, and other dental work typically do not pose a problem 
That includes some pacemakers, clips for treating aneurysms, and other devices with metal in them 
A nurse may review your health history before your exam 
You may be given medications or contrast dye or have blood drawn 
You may not wear clothing with snaps or zippers in the scanner 
An MRI machine uses a powerful magnet to make images of your body 
Unlike a CT scan, it does not use x rays or other radiation 
You will also be given a squeeze ball to hold 
You can use this to signal the technologist any time you need something 
A series of scans are taken with a brief pause between each 
You may hear different noises as different scans are taken 
You need to remain still when the scan is being taken 
They can help you with some tips for staying comfortable 
If you need to be removed from the scanner, this can be done very quickly 
After your exam, the images will be reviewed by your radiologist 
Ask your health care provider any questions you have about your MRI

Not everyone who has one seizure will have another one 
MedicationsTreatment of seizures often involves the use of anti seizure medicines 
Sometimes a health care professional might recommend more than one medicine 
Common side effects may include weight changes, dizziness, fatigue and mood changes 
Very rarely, more serious side effects can cause damage to the liver or bone marrow 
you may be taking to ensure that the anti seizure medicines won t interact with them 
A ketogenic diet is high in fat and very low in carbohydrates 
But it can be challenging to follow because there s a limited range of foods allowed 
Variations on a high fat, low carbohydrate diet also may be helpful but less effective 
SurgeryIf treatment with at least two anti seizure medicines isn t effective, surgery may be an option 
Many daily functional abilities may be lost after this surgery 
They can reduce seizures along with continued anti seizure medicine use 
A device is implanted on the surface of the brain or within brain tissue 
The device can detect seizure activity and deliver electrical stimulation to stop the seizure 
The electrodes attach to a pacemaker like device placed under the skin of the chest 
Pregnancy and seizuresWomen who ve had seizures typically are able to have healthy pregnancies 
But birth defects related to certain medicines can sometimes occur 
Creating a plan with your health care team before you become pregnant is particularly important 
It s recommended that all people of childbearing age take folic acid while on anti seizure medicines 
Birth control and anti seizure medicinesSome anti seizure medicines can alter the effectiveness of birth control 
Other forms of birth control may need to be considered 
Potential future treatmentsResearchers are studying other potential therapies to treat seizures 
One area of research showing promise is MRI guided focused ultrasound 
The beam creates acoustic energy to destroy brain tissue in a targeted way without surgery 
It also can focus on a target without damaging the nearby tissue 
Here are some steps you can take to help with seizure control 
Don t adjust the dosage before talking to your health care professional 
Exercising and being active may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression

Experts recommend that people at high risk have an HIV test every year 
They also suggest hepatitis B screening at each pregnancy for everyone 
Experts recommend that women have a Pap test every three years starting at age 
Experts recommend that all sexually active women under age be tested for chlamydia infection 
The chlamydia test uses a sample of urine or vaginal fluid you can collect yourself 
Experts also recommend screening for gonorrhea in sexually active women under age 
Many public health groups recommend annual or more frequent STI screening for these men 
Regular tests for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea are particularly important 
Having HIV raises your risk of getting other sexually transmitted diseases 
They also recommend that people with HIV be screened for hepatitis C 
Then, experts recommend repeating the Pap test every year for three years 
After three negative tests, women with HIV can get a Pap test every three years 
However, experts don t recommend routine testing for genital herpes unless you have symptoms

Even one case of smallpox would be a public health emergency 
This test can tell for sure if a person has the virus 
Treatment If someone were infected with smallpox, new antiviral medications may be used 
Research found that it worked in animals and in lab tests 
However, it hasn t been tested in people who are sick with smallpox 
So it s not known if it s an effective drug option 
A study tested it in healthy people and found it to be safe 
It has been safely given to healthy people and people with other viruses 
It s unknown if these drugs work in a person with smallpox 
Research continues to study other antiviral drugs to treat smallpox

Sticky platelets begin to form clots when blood vessels are injured 
Clotting proteins in blood plasma also are involved in the process 
Aspirin is also the least expensive treatment with the fewest potential side effects 
An alternative to aspirin is the anti platelet drug clopidogrel Plavix 
Aspirin and clopidogrel may be prescribed together for about a month after the TIA 
Sometimes both medicines are taken together for a longer period 
They lower the risk of blood clots by affecting clotting system proteins instead of platelet function 
AngioplastySome people need a procedure called carotid angioplasty and stent placement 
This procedure involves using a balloon like device to open a clogged artery

A number of tests and procedures are used to help diagnose tongue cancer 
Which ones are best for you depends on your medical history and symptoms 
Using a tiny camera to look at the mouth and throat 
Called an endoscopy, this test uses a thin tube with a light and camera 
The tube is inserted into the nose and passed down to the throat 
It looks for signs of tongue cancer in the mouth and throat 
Called a biopsy, this test involves taking a sample of cells from the tongue 
Barium coats the throat and makes it easier to see on X rays 
An ultrasound may be used to look for cancer in the lymph nodes 
It might show whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the neck 
Tongue cancer surgerySurgery is the most common treatment for tongue cancer 
Removing the margin helps ensure that all the cancer cells are removed 
How much of the tongue the surgeon removes depends on the size of the cancer 
The surgery might remove some of the tongue or all of the tongue 
This depends on how much of the tongue is removed 
The tools are put into the mouth to access the cancer 
Many cancers at the front part of the tongue can be removed without robotic aid 
When tongue cancer spreads, it often goes to the lymph nodes in the neck first 
Sentinel node biopsy isn t an option for everyone with tongue cancer 
Radiation therapy is sometimes the main treatment for tongue cancer 
It also can be used after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells 
Radiation for tongue cancer can make it hard to swallow 
Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to control the growth of the cells 
It also may be used after surgery to kill any remaining cells 
Targeted therapy is used to treat tongue cancer that comes back or spreads 
Treatment for advanced tongue cancer can impact your ability to speak and eat

Diagnosis There s no specific test that can diagnose Tourette syndrome 
The diagnosis is based on the history of your signs and symptoms 
Both motor tics and vocal tics are present, although not necessarily at the same time 
Tics aren t caused by medications, other substances or another medical condition 
Tics must change over time in location, frequency, type, complexity or severity 
A diagnosis of Tourette syndrome might be overlooked because the signs can mimic other conditions 
Eye blinking might be initially associated with vision problems, or sniffling attributed to allergies 
Both motor and vocal tics can be caused by conditions other than Tourette syndrome 
To rule out other causes of tics, your doctor might recommend 
Treatment is aimed at controlling tics that interfere with everyday activities and functioning 
MedicationMedications to help control tics or reduce symptoms of related conditions include 
Fluphenazine, haloperidol Haldol , risperidone Risperdal and pimozide Orap can help control tics 
Possible side effects include weight gain and involuntary repetitive movements 
Tetrabenazine Xenazine might be recommended, although it may cause severe depression 
An injection into the affected muscle might help relieve a simple or vocal tic 
However, for some people with Tourette syndrome, medications for ADHD can exacerbate tics 
Fluoxetine Prozac, Sarafem, others might help control symptoms of sadness, anxiety and OCD 
For severe tics that don t respond to other treatment, DBS might help

For Tourette syndrome, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Depending on the results, your health care provider may repeat a test after two weeks 
More diagnostic tests are used depending on other symptoms, your health and other factors 
MRI or CT scans are used to create images of the brain 
These may detect irregular structures in the brain related to toxoplasmosis 
CSF is the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord 
Laboratory tests may detect toxoplasma in CSF if there is infection in the brain 
Rarely, tissue is removed from the brain to detect the parasite 
PregnancyIn the United States, pregnant people are not routinely screened for toxoplasmosis 
Your health care provider may order a diagnostic blood test for you if 
Ultrasound images of your baby show irregular features linked to toxoplasmosis 
If you have an active infection, it may pass to your baby in the womb 
A diagnosis is based on tests of the fluid surrounding the baby, called amniotic fluid 
Ultrasound images of the fetus show irregular features linked to toxoplasmosis 
Tests of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal column 
How much and how long you take medicine depends on different factors 
Your provider may give you a combination of prescription drugs 
Other possible side effects with long term use include bone marrow suppression and liver toxicity

Diagnosis Transposition of the great arteries is most often diagnosed after a baby is born 
But sometimes the condition may be seen before birth during a routine pregnancy ultrasound 
TestsTests are needed to confirm a diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries 
This test uses sound waves to create moving pictures of the beating heart 
It shows how blood flows through the heart, heart valves and blood vessels 
It can show the positions of the two main arteries leaving the heart 
This simple, painless test records the electrical activity of the heart 
Surgeries and other treatments used to treat transposition of the great arteries may include 
This treatment may be done urgently as a temporary fix before surgery 
It helps mix oxygen rich and oxygen poor blood, improving oxygen levels in the baby s body 
This is the most common surgery used to correct transposition of the great arteries 
Other heart problems present at birth may be repaired during this surgery 
The surgeon splits blood flow between the heart s two upper chambers 
An artificial valve connects the right lower heart chamber to the lung artery 
This complex surgery is used to treat congenitally corrected transposition 
Other surgeries may be needed to fix those heart problems 
Surgery also may be needed to treat complications of TGA 
If TGA causes changes in the heartbeat, a device called a pacemaker may be recommended 
This type of health care provider is called a congenital cardiologist 
Include the dates of treatment or surgery and the health care providers names and numbers 
After surgery to fix TGA, some high energy activities might need to be avoided 
Talk with a health care provider about which exercises or activities are safe 
Here s some Information to help you prepare for the appointments 
Get a complete family history for both sides of your family 
Ask if anyone in your family was born with a heart problem 
Take a family member or friend with you, if possible 
Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all of the Information provided to you 
Someone who goes with you may be able to remember details 
What other treatments are available, and which do you recommend 
Is there a family history of heart problems at birth 
Does the person have blue or gray skin, difficulty feeding, or trouble breathing 
Does the person have shortness of breath, swelling of the legs or irregular heartbeats 
It may be found when imaging tests of the heart are done for other reasons 
The care professional listens to your heart using a device called a stethoscope 
A whooshing sound called a heart murmur may be heard 
The tests can show how severe any valve disease is and help learn the cause 
This is the main test for diagnosing tricuspid valve regurgitation 
It uses sound waves to create pictures of the beating heart 
It creates pictures of the heart from outside the body 
Sometimes, a more detailed echocardiogram is needed to better see the tricuspid valve 
It creates pictures of the heart from inside the body 
Sensors, called electrodes, stick to the chest and sometimes the legs 
Cardiac MRI may help show the severity of tricuspid valve regurgitation 
The test also gives details about the lower right heart chamber 
This test isn t often used to diagnose tricuspid valve disease 
But it can be helpful if other tests haven t diagnosed the cause of the condition 
The exact treatment depends on your symptoms and how severe the valve disease is 
Some people with mild tricuspid valve regurgitation only need regular health checkups 
Your healthcare team tells you how often you need appointments 
MedicationsYour healthcare professional may suggest medicines to control symptoms of tricuspid valve regurgitation 
Often called water pills, these medicines make you urinate more often 
Also called aldosterone antagonists, these medicines may help some people with heart failure live longer 
Some people with tricuspid regurgitation have a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation AFib 
TherapiesSupplemental oxygen may be given to those who have pulmonary hypotension with tricuspid regurgitation 
Sometimes, tricuspid valve disease may be treated with a catheter based procedure 
The treatment can help improve blood flow and reduce symptoms of heart valve disease 
You may need tricuspid valve repair or replacement surgery if 
The valve disease is severe and you have symptoms such as shortness of breath 
Types of heart valve surgery to treat tricuspid regurgitation include 
It also may reduce the need for long term use of blood thinners 
Tricuspid valve repair is traditionally done as an open heart surgery 
A long cut is made in the center of the chest 
Sometimes the surgeon removes or reshapes tissue to help the tricuspid valve close more tightly 
The cords of tissue that support the valve also may be replaced 
If the tricuspid valve can t be repaired, surgery may be needed to replace the valve 
During tricuspid valve replacement, a surgeon removes the damaged or diseased valve 
But they can wear down over time and may need to be replaced 
The replacement valve goes through the catheter and into the existing biological valve 
PregnancyCareful and regular checkups are needed for those who have tricuspid valve disease during pregnancy 
Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins 
Avoid saturated fats and trans fats, sugar, and refined grains 
If you need help quitting, talk to a healthcare professional 
Talk to your healthcare team before starting a new exercise routine

Tell your healthcare team about all the medicines you take 
Write down your symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to tricuspid valve regurgitation 
Make a list of all the medicines, vitamins and supplements that you take 
For tricuspid valve regurgitation, some basic questions to ask your care team include 
Can you recommend any websites for more Information on my condition 
Diagnosis Truncus arteriosus is usually diagnosed soon after a child is born 
The baby may look blue or gray and have trouble breathing 
A chest X ray also can tell if the lungs have extra fluid 
It shows blood flow through the heart and heart valves 
There s typically a hole in the wall between the lower heart chambers 
Treatment Infants with truncus arteriosus need surgery to improve blood flow and oxygen levels 
Many procedures or surgeries might be needed, especially as a child grows 
medicines might be given before surgery to help improve heart health 
Children and adults with surgically repaired truncus arteriosus need regular health checkups for life 
MedicationsSome of the medicines that might be given before truncus arteriosus surgery include 
Also called diuretics, these medicines help the kidneys remove extra fluid from the body 
These medicines help the heart pump stronger, which improves blood flow 
Positive inotropes may be given by IV to treat severe heart failure symptoms 
The specific type of surgery depends on the baby s condition 
Rebuilds the single large vessel and aorta to create a new, complete aorta 
Separates the upper part of the pulmonary artery from the single large vessel 
Uses a patch to close the hole between the two lower heart chambers 
The tube used to create the new pulmonary artery doesn t grow with a child 
Follow up surgeries are needed to replace the tube as the child grows 
Future surgeries may be done with a flexible tube called a catheter 
A new valve can be delivered through the catheter to the proper area 
Some people with heart problems need to limit exercise and sports activities, especially competitive sports 
Antibiotics may be recommended before dental procedures and other surgical procedures to prevent infections 
It s also important to have good oral hygiene and regular dental checkups 
Pregnancy is considered very high risk for those with Eisenmenger syndrome and is not recommended 
Connecting with others in support groups may help manage stress 
Include details about any diagnosis, medicines, surgeries and other procedures 
Include dosages for medicines Write down any health care providers names and phone numbers 
It s also helpful to providers who are unfamiliar with your child s health history 
You might worry about the risks of vigorous activity, especially after heart repair surgery 
Heart problems at birth can be passed down through families 
Also make a list of questions to ask your baby s health care provider 
What are the possible side effects or complications of treatment 
What to expect from your doctorYour child s health care provider typically asks the following questions 
Seizure evaluationDiagnostic testing will likely include an electroencephalogram eh lek tro en SEF uh lo gram , sometimes called an EEG 
This test records electrical activity in the brain and can help determine what s causing seizures 
Brain, lungs, kidneys and liver evaluationTo detect growths in the body, tests may include 
Heart evaluationTo determine whether the heart is affected, tests usually include 
This test uses sound waves to produce images of the heart 
Also called an ECG or EKG, this test records the electrical activity of the heart 
Dental examThis exam involves looking at the teeth and the inside of the mouth 
It will likely include X rays of the teeth and jaws 
Genetic testingGenetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis 
More Information CT scanEchocardiogramEEG electroencephalogram Electrocardiogram ECG or EKG MRIUltrasoundShow more related Information 
Although there is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, treatment can help manage specific symptoms 
Other medicines may help manage heart rhythm problems, behavior problems or other symptoms 
Using these medicines early in care may help reduce the risk of seizures 
Sometimes surgery helps control seizures caused by brain growths that don t respond to medicine 
Surgical procedures such as dermabrasion or laser treatment may improve the appearance of skin growths 
Early intervention services, such as occupational, physical or speech therapy, may be helpful 
These therapies can help children with tuberous sclerosis who have special needs in these areas 
The therapies can improve children s ability to manage daily tasks and activities 
When needed, social, vocational and rehabilitation services may continue throughout life 
To help you and your child cope, here s what you can do 
Issues with behavior that sometimes occur with tuberous sclerosis can be challenging for parents 
Remember that the behavior is not your fault and it s not your child s fault 
Talk to your child s health care provider if problems occur 
Your love and support are essential to helping your child reach full potential 
When needed, counseling with a mental health provider may help with adjustment and coping 
Respite care services may provide helpful relief and support for parents 
Preparing for your appointmentSymptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth 
Or you may notice something and raise concerns with your child s health care provider

All medicines, vitamins, herbs and other supplements your child is taking, and the doses 
Questions to ask your child s health care provider may include 
How often will you want to evaluate my child s health and development 
Are there any clinical trials that might be helpful for my child 
How can I help my child cope with this disorder 
How can I find other families who are living with tuberous sclerosis 
Has your child had any behavior problems, such as hyperactivity, aggression or self injury 
Has your child withdrawn from others or become less socially and emotionally engaged 
The higher the blood sugar levels, the more hemoglobin you ll have with sugar attached 
An A C level of or higher on two separate tests means you have diabetes 
Blood sugar values are expressed in milligrams per deciliter mg dL or millimoles per liter mmol L 
A blood sample will be taken after you don t eat fast overnight 
A fasting blood sugar level less than mg dL mmol L is healthy 
If you re diagnosed with diabetes, your provider may also run blood tests 
These will check for autoantibodies that are common in type diabetes 
After the diagnosisYou ll regularly visit your provider to talk about managing your diabetes 
During these visits, the provider will check your A C levels 
Your target A C goal may vary depending on your age and various other factors 
After meal numbers should be no higher than mg dL mmol L two hours after eating 
Insulin and other medicationsAnyone who has type diabetes needs insulin therapy throughout their life 
Examples are glulisine Apidra , lispro Humalog, Admelog and Lyumjev and aspart Novolog and FiAsp 
Examples are glargine Lantus, Toujeo Solostar, Basaglar , detemir Levemir and degludec Tresiba 
Insulin pumps are programmed to dispense specific amounts of insulin automatically and when you eat 
You ll need to either get shots injections or use an insulin pump 
Insulin pens look like ink pens and are available in disposable or refillable varieties 
It may be especially helpful for preventing low blood sugar 
Continuous glucose monitors attach to the body using a fine needle just under the skin 
They check blood glucose levels every few minutes d loop system 
Other medicationsOther medications also may be prescribed for people with type diabetes, such as 
Your provider may recommend you take baby or regular aspirin daily to protect your heart 
Your provider may feel that you have an increased risk of a cardiovascular event 
Your provider will discuss the risk of bleeding if you take aspirin 
Triglycerides, another type of blood fat, should be less than mg dL mmol L 
Healthy eating and monitoring carbohydratesThere s no such thing as a diabetes diet 
However, it s important to center your diet on nutritious, low fat, high fiber foods such as 
This healthy eating plan is recommended even for people without diabetes 
This will allow your body to properly use those carbohydrates 
A registered dietitian can help you create a meal plan that fits your needs 
Physical activityEveryone needs regular aerobic exercise, including people who have type diabetes 
It s a good idea to check your blood sugar anytime you re getting behind the wheel 
If it s below mg dL mmol L , have a snack with grams of carbohydrates 
Type diabetes can pose some challenges in the workplace 
The risk of complications during pregnancy is higher for people with type diabetes 
Experts recommend that you see your provider before you get pregnant 
A C readings should be less than before you try to get pregnant 
Careful management of your diabetes during pregnancy can lower your risk of complications 
It could also increase the risk of low blood sugar 
With a successful pancreas transplant, you would no longer need insulin 
But pancreas transplants aren t always successful and the procedure poses serious risks 
They can also be used for people who also need a kidney transplant 
Signs of troubleDespite your best efforts, sometimes problems will happen 
Certain short term complications of type diabetes, such as low blood sugar, require care immediately 
Diabetic hypoglycemia occurs when someone with diabetes doesn t have enough sugar glucose in the blood 
Ask your provider what s considered a low blood sugar level for you 
Test your blood sugar if you think your levels are low 
Nighttime hypoglycemia may cause you to wake with sweat soaked pajamas or a headache 
If diabetic hypoglycemia isn t treated, symptoms of hypoglycemia worsen and can include 
Confusion, unusual behavior or both, such as the inability to complete routine tasks 
Glucagon is a hormone that stimulates the release of sugar into the blood 
Don t inject insulin, as this will cause blood sugar levels to drop even further 
Don t give fluids or food, because these could cause choking 
If you think you have hyperglycemia, check your blood sugar 
If it is higher than your target range, you ll likely need to administer a correction 
High blood sugar levels don t come down as quickly as they go up 
Ask your provider how long to wait until you recheck 
If your cells are starved for energy, the body may begin to break down fat 
Wear a tag or bracelet that says you are living with diabetes 
Make sure your friends and loved ones know how to use the kit 
During the physical, your provider will look for any diabetes related complications 
Consult your provider if you have a sore or other foot problem that doesn t heal 
These include heart attack, stroke, nerve damage and kidney disease 
It depends on how much you drink and if you eat at the same time 
If you choose to drink, do so only in moderation and always with a meal 
Coping and supportDiabetes can affect emotions both directly and indirectly 
Poorly controlled blood sugar can directly affect emotions by causing behavior changes, such as irritability 
People living with diabetes have an increased risk of depression and diabetes related distress 
You may find that it helps to talk to other people with type diabetes 
They may also share their own experiences or helpful Information 
For example, they may share where to find carbohydrate counts for your favorite takeout restaurant 
You can also reach the ADA at DIABETES or JDRF at CURE 
A simple blood test can show if you need more evaluation and treatment 
After diagnosis, you ll need close medical follow up until your blood sugar level is stable 
A thorough yearly exam and regular foot and eye exams also are important 
They can also let you know what to expect from your provider 
Once you begin insulin treatment, the first symptoms of diabetes should go away 
However, you may have new issues that you need to address 
Make a list of all the medications, vitamins and supplements you re taking 
Things you want to discuss with your provider, registered dietitian or diabetes educator include 
When and how often you should monitor your blood glucose 
Insulin therapy types of insulin used, timing of dosing, amount of dose 
Nutrition types of food and their effect on blood sugar 
Medical management how often to visit your provider and other diabetes care team members 
What to expect from your doctorYour provider is likely to ask you many questions, including 
Do you know when your blood sugar is getting low 
The exam involves moving your wrist or hand into different positions to see what hurts 
The exam also checks your range of motion and grip strength 
This simple, noninvasive test can help examine tendons, ligaments and cysts 
SurgeryTreatment for some types of ulnar wrist pain can include surgery 
Minimally invasive surgical methods may be used and can speed recovery 
This can mean less pain, a shorter hospital stay and fewer complications 
Or you may be referred immediately to a specialist in orthopedics or sports medicine 
For ulnar wrist pain, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
Diagnosis Tests and procedures used to diagnose ureteral cancer include 
You may undergo a urinalysis to analyze your urine for any abnormalities 
Use of a thin, lighted tube to view the ureters 
The scope is passed through your bladder and into your ureters 
This may include sophisticated analysis of the gene mutations involved in your cancer 
People diagnosed with ureteral cancer have a high risk of bladder cancer 
The extent of your surgery will depend on your situation 
For very early stage ureteral cancer, surgery may involve removing only a portion of the ureter 
Chemotherapy may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may remain 
The tests you ll undergo and the schedule of exams will depend on your situation 
Are there any restrictions that I need to follow in the meantime 
Questions to consider if your doctor refers you to a specialist include 
These look for infection, blood or cancer in the urine 
This measures the urine flow and how strong it is 
This looks at whether there s still urine in the bladder after emptying it 
This looks at the pelvic bone to see how it s involved with the condition 
This test uses X ray images to look for a problem or injury of the urethra 
It also shows how long the stricture is and where it is 
This uses a thin, tubelike tool that has a lens, called a cystoscope 
Self catheterization might be a choice for those diagnosed with a short stricture 
This starts with a tiny wire put through the urethra and into the bladder 
This outpatient procedure may be a choice to treat recurrent urethral strictures 
This involves surgically removing the narrowed section of the urethra or making it larger 
The procedure might also involve rebuilding tissues around the urethra 
The chance of urethral stricture coming back after a urethroplasty is low 
This procedure uses a thin, tubelike tool that has a lens, called a cystoscope 
This surgical procedure has a faster recovery than do some other procedures 
It doesn t leave much scarring, and the risk of infection is low 
This treatment might be for people with a severe stricture who don t want surgery 
These procedures have a risk of bladder irritation, discomfort and urinary tract infections 
Tests and procedures used to diagnose urinary tract infections include 
Your health care provider may ask for a urine sample 
Lab analysis of the urine is sometimes followed by a urine culture 
This test tells your provider what bacteria are causing the infection 
It can let your provider know which medications will be most effective 
Recurrent UTIs may be caused by a structural problem in the urinary tract 
A contrast dye may be used to highlight structures in your urinary tract 
If you have recurrent UTIs, your health care provider may perform a cystoscopy 
The cystoscope is inserted in the urethra and passed through to the bladder 
Treatment Antibiotics usually are the first treatment for urinary tract infections 
The group of antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones isn t commonly recommended for simple UTIs 
The risks of these drugs generally outweigh the benefits for treating uncomplicated UTIs 
Often, UTI symptoms clear up within a few days of starting treatment 
But you may need to continue antibiotics for a week or more 
That may mean taking an antibiotic for to days 
But pain usually goes away soon after starting an antibiotic 
Frequent infectionsIf you have frequent UTIs, your health care provider may recommend 
You ll also be asked to stay in touch with your provider 
Taking a single dose of antibiotic after sex if UTIs are related to sexual activity 
Severe infectionFor a severe UTI, you may need IV antibiotics in a hospital 
Water helps to dilute your urine and flush out bacteria 
They can irritate your bladder and tend to increase the need to urinate 
Alternative medicine Many people drink cranberry juice to prevent UTIs 
But don t drink cranberry juice if you re taking blood thinning medication, such as warfarin Jantovin 
Or you may see a health care provider who specializes in kidney disorders 
Take note of your symptoms, even if you re not sure they re related to a UTI 
For a UTI, basic questions to ask your provider include 
What factors do you think may have contributed to my UTI 
What is the risk that this problem will come back 
What steps can I take to lower the risk of the infection coming back 
Have you ever been treated for a bladder or kidney infection 
This test checks the urine for possible signs of kidney or urinary tract problems 
A sample of urine also is likely to be checked for bacteria that cause illness 
If this happens, it might mean you need more fluids 
Make sure you drink enough fluids daily to stay hydrated and keep yourself healthy 
Do you see blood or blood clots in your urine

Self dilation may allow you to create a vagina without surgery 
The goal is to lengthen the vagina to a size comfortable for sexual intercourse 
As the weeks go by, you switch to larger dilators 
It may take a few months to get the result you want 
Artificial lubrication and trying a different type of dilator may be helpful 
SurgeryIf self dilation doesn t work, surgery to create a functional vagina vaginoplasty may be an option 
Possible sources include skin from the outer thigh, buttocks or lower abdomen 
After the initial time recommended by your surgeon, you ll use the dilator only at night 
Sexual intercourse with artificial lubrication and occasional dilation helps you maintain a functional vagina 
Coping and supportLearning you have vaginal agenesis can be difficult 
What to expect from your doctorQuestions your health care provider may ask include 
You ll get a physical exam, which may include a pelvic exam 
TestsIf a vaginal fistula isn t found during a physical exam, you may need other tests 
If you have a vaginal fistula, dye appears in your vagina 
You also may see traces of the dye on a tampon after physical exercise 
During this exam, your healthcare professional uses a hollow device equipped with a lens 
With the cystoscope, your healthcare professional can see inside your bladder 
This test may help your healthcare professional see if you have more than one fistula 
It lets your healthcare professional check the anus and rectum 
In this test, you have a contrast material injected into a vein 
A lab checks the biopsy sample for signs of cancer 
It s not common, but some vaginal fistulas can be due to cancer 
You also may need lab tests to help find the cause of your symptoms 
A urinary catheter is a flexible tube that drains the bladder 
You might need to use it for more than three weeks 
This procedure can treat some fistulas between the vagina and the ureters 
A hollow tube called a stent is placed inside the ureter to keep it open 
Your healthcare professional also may recommend supplements to make stool softer and easier to pass 
Most often, surgery is needed to treat a vaginal fistula 
If tissue is infected, medicines called antibiotics can clear up the infection 
Sometimes, a flap made of healthy tissue is used to help close the area 
Surgery may be done through the vagina or stomach area 
Often, a type of surgery that involves one or more small cuts can be done 
Some surgeons also control robotic arms with an attached camera and surgical tools 
The colostomy opening is closed a few months after fistula surgery 
Still, some people need more than one surgery to get relief 
You ll likely be examined while lying down and standing up 
This technique Valsalva maneuver can make a varicocele easier to examine 
Imaging testYour health care provider may want you to have an ultrasound exam 
Ultrasound uses high frequency sound waves to create images of structures inside your body 
Eliminate another condition as a possible cause of signs or symptoms 
Treatment A varicocele often doesn t need to be treated 
Low sperm count or other sperm irregularities usually only tested in adults 
The affected testicle eventually may return to its expected size 
In the case of a teenager, the testicle may catch up in development 
Sperm counts may improve, and sperm irregularities may be corrected 
Surgery may improve fertility or improve semen quality for in vitro fertilization 
Risks of surgeryVaricocele repair presents relatively few risks, which might include 
The surgeon makes a tiny incision low in the groin 
Using a powerful microscope, the surgeon identifies and ligates several small veins 
RecoveryPain from this surgery generally is mild but might continue for several days or weeks 
Your doctor might prescribe pain medication for a limited period after surgery 
Take nonprescription pain medicine, such as acetaminophen Tylenol, others or ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others 
Support the scrotum by wearing an athletic supporter or snug briefs 
It may also be diagnosed during a more complex diagnostic process for fertility treatment 
Have you had any injury to your groin or genitals 
What medications, dietary supplements, vitamins or herbal remedies do you take 
Diagnosis To diagnose varicose veins, a healthcare professional examines you 
This includes looking at your legs while you re standing to check for swelling 
You might be asked to describe the pain and aching in your legs 
Procedures to treat varicose veins are often done as outpatient procedures 
That means you most often go home on the same day 
Ask your insurer if varicose vein treatment is a covered cost 
Self care measures also might keep the veins from getting worse 
Compression stockingsWearing compression stockings all day is often the first approach to try 
The stockings squeeze the legs, helping veins and leg muscles move blood 
You can find compression stockings at most pharmacies and medical supply stores 
Insurance might cover the prescription ones if your varicose veins cause symptoms 
Laser treatment sends strong bursts of light onto the varicose vein 
This makes the vein slowly fade until it can t be seen 
This procedure is the treatment most used for larger varicose veins 
A healthcare professional puts a thin tube called a catheter into an enlarged vein 
Radiofrequency or laser energy heats the tip of the catheter 
The next step is removing the varicose vein through small cuts 
Removing the vein won t keep blood from flowing in the leg 
That s because veins deeper in the leg take care of the larger amounts of blood 
A healthcare professional removes smaller varicose veins through tiny pricks in the skin 
Lifestyle and home remediesTry these lifestyle and home remedies for varicose veins 
Walking is a great way to help blood flow in the legs 
Your healthcare professional can suggest a good activity level for you 
Follow a low salt diet to prevent swelling caused when the body holds in water 
Tight clothes around your waist, legs or groin can reduce blood flow 
For instance, lie down with your legs resting on three or four pillows 
You also can raise the foot of the bed six inches 
Important personal Information, including a family history of varicose veins or spider veins 
How can I best manage varicose veins along with other health conditions I have 
Are there any brochures or other printed materials I can have 
What to expect from your doctorYour health professional is likely to ask you questions, including 
What you can do in the meantimeBefore your appointment, you can begin self care 
Try not to stand or sit in one position for a long time 
A thorough physical exam, medical history and testing are required to diagnose ventricular tachycardia 
Ventricular tachycardia sometimes requires emergency medical care and may be diagnosed at a hospital 
An electrocardiogram ECG or EKG records the electrical signals from the heart 
A wearable cardiac event monitor may be used to diagnose tachycardia 
Test results also can help determine if another health problem is causing V tach 
Small sensors, called electrodes, attach to the chest and sometimes the arms and legs 
Wires connect the sensors to a computer, which prints or displays results 
Some personal devices, such as smartwatches, offer portable ECG monitoring 
This small device records the heartbeat continuously for up to three years 
The device tells your care team how your heart beats during daily activities 
It is placed just under the skin of the chest during a minor procedure 
Imaging tests can help your care team check the structure of your heart 
It uses sounds waves to create a picture of the beating heart 
It can show areas of poor blood flow and heart valve problems 
Some types of tachycardia are triggered or worsened by exercise 
This test creates still or moving pictures of blood flow through the heart 
It is most often done to determine a cause of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation 
Watch how heart MRI, also called cardiac MRI, is used to view the heart 
A tilt table test may be done to better understand how tachycardia leads to fainting 
Then, under careful supervision, the table slowly tilts until you are standing 
The test shows how the heart and nervous system respond to changes in body position 
Ventricular tachycardia that lasts longer than seconds, called sustained V tach, needs emergency medical treatment 
A subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator S ICD is a less invasive alternative to a traditional ICD 
It connects it to a sensor that runs along the breastbone 
A surgery or procedure may be needed to control or prevent episodes of tachycardia 
Cardioversion uses quick, low energy shocks to reset the heart rhythm 
A shock also can be delivered to the heart using an automated external defibrillator AED 
Catheter ablation also may be done to diagnose irregular heartbeats

Coping and supportMake plans to manage an episode of a fast heartbeat 
Doing so may help you feel calmer and more in control when one occurs 
How to check your heart rate and what rate is best for you 
If you have ventricular tachycardia, you may not have time to prepare 
You may be treated at a hospital or emergency medical center 
Your symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to your heart 
medicines that you take, including vitamins, supplements and those bought without a prescription 
Does anything, such as exercise, stress or caffeine, seem to trigger or worsen episodes 
Has anyone in your family had sudden cardiac death or died suddenly 
Do you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or other heart or blood vessel conditions 
What medicines do you take for these conditions, and do you take them as prescribed 
Diagnosis Vertebral tumors sometimes may be overlooked because their symptoms resemble those of more common conditions 
MRI is usually the preferred test to diagnose vertebral tumors 
Earplugs, televisions or headphones can be used to help minimize the noise 
Mild sedatives are frequently used to relieve the anxiety of claustrophobia 
More Information Vertebral tumor care at CT scanMRINeedle biopsyShow more related Information 
Ideally, the goal of vertebral tumor treatment is to completely get rid of the tumor 
Sometimes, surgery might be followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy or both 
It may also be the first line therapy for some vertebral tumors 
Radiation therapy may also be used to relieve pain when surgery is too risky 
This treatment, which isn t actually surgery, delivers a high dose of precisely targeted radiation 
Growing research supports its use for the treatment of spinal tumors 
However, there are risks such as an increased risk of vertebral fractures

Acupuncture may also help relieve certain types of pain in people with cancer 
Coping and supportLearning that you have a vertebral tumor can be overwhelming 
Find out all you can about your specific vertebral tumor 
A doctor who sees you for a possible vertebral tumor may ask 
Do you have any family history of noncancerous or cancerous tumors 
To further evaluate your voice problems, the following tests may be performed 
This test measures the electrical currents in your voice box muscles 
Tests may include blood work, X rays, MRI or CT scans 
Treatment may include voice therapy, bulk injections, surgery or a combination of treatments 
In some instances, you may get better without surgical treatment 
This allows your unimpaired vocal cord to better vibrate against its paralyzed partner 
It can take as long as to months before your voice gets better 
Some health care providers combine this surgery with a bulk injection 
This causes a lot of trouble breathing and requires a surgery called a tracheotomy 
A breathing tube is inserted, allowing air to bypass the vocal cords 
Coping and supportVocal cord paralysis can be frustrating and affect your daily life 
A speech therapist can help you develop the skills you need to communicate 
In that case, you ll probably first be seen in a hospital emergency department 
You may also be referred to a speech language pathologist for voice assessment and therapy 
Write down key personal Information, including any major stresses or recent illnesses or life changes 
Someone who is with you may remember something that you missed or forgot 
For vocal cord paralysis, some basic questions to ask your provider include 
What s the most likely cause of my vocal cord paralysis 
Is this condition temporary, or will my vocal cords always be paralyzed 
Are there any restrictions on using my voice after treatment 
Will I be able to talk or sing after treatment 
Diagnosis Your healthcare professional will ask about the event and your symptoms 
Your healthcare professional also will want to know how well you can do everyday tasks 
You will be asked to move and do simple tasks to check the 
Degree of motion that causes pain or an increase in pain 
This special type of X ray can make detailed images of bone and show damage 
This imaging test uses radio waves and a magnetic field to make detailed D images 
Your treatment plan will depend on the extent of your whiplash injury 
Some people need only medicines available without a prescription and at home care 
Others may need prescription medicines, pain treatment or physical therapy 
managementYour healthcare professional may suggest one or more of the following treatments to lessen pain 
Rest may be helpful for a day or two after your injury 
Short term use of these drugs might help loosen tight muscles and soothe pain 
The medicine also can make you feel sleepy 
ExerciseYour healthcare professional might prescribe stretching and movement exercises for you to do at home 
In some cases, a procedure called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS may be used 
The number of physical therapy sessions depends on the person s needs 
Your physical therapist also can create an exercise program for you to do at home 
Experts don t agree on how to use a collar, though 
Some experts suggest using it no more than hours 
Your healthcare professional can tell you how to use the collar, and for how long 
Acupuncture involves putting fine needles into certain areas on the skin 
They include numbness or dizziness, and rarely damage to spinal tissues 
Neck massage may provide short term relief of neck pain from whiplash injury 
However, a whiplash injury may not cause symptoms right away 
Have you had neck pain in the past, or do you have it often 
Have you tried medicines or other treatments to relieve the pain 
Your doctor also talks with you about your medical history and what s important to you 
Treatment Several wrinkle treatment options are available to help smooth wrinkles 
Your doctor may suggest two or more treatments for the best result 
Your doctor may prescribe an anti wrinkle product with prescription strength retinoids 
These creams and serums are intended to reduce fine wrinkles and splotches 
Examples are tretinoin Renova, Retin A , tazarotene Avage, Tazorac and adapalene Differin 
When injected in small doses into specific muscles, Botox prevents the muscles from moving 
It may take up to seven days to see results 
A chemical peel may be done as an outpatient procedure 
Possible side effects include scarring, infection and changes in skin color of the treated area 
People with brown or Black skin have a higher risk of long term skin color changes 
Examples are calcium hydroxylapatite Radiesse , poly L lactic acid Sculptra and hyaluronic acid Restylane, Juvederm, others 
It may take to sessions to achieve the result you re looking for 
After about six months, repeat injections are needed to maintain results 
Possible side effects are inflamed skin, bruising and changes in skin color 
These procedures can smooth the skin, but they can t fix sagging skin 
As the wound heals, the new collagen leads to smoother, tighter skin 
On average, it takes to days to recover 
It has a shorter recovery time than does the ablative method 
Nonablative resurfacing can be a good option for people with moderate wrinkles 
Laser resurfacing risks include scarring, infection and skin color changes in the treated area 
Before treatment, talk with your doctor about any history of hyperpigmentation or keloid formation 
Deoxycholic acid Kybella injections are used to treat excess fat under the chin 
The result is a reduction in fullness under the chin 
Face lift surgery involves lifting the skin and tightening the underlying muscle and tissues 
The goal is to improve the look of the jawline, neck and lower face 
A neck lift is often done at the same time 
These surgeries may be done in a hospital or an outpatient surgical facility 
Bruising and swelling won t clear up for several weeks after surgery 
You may choose to undergo another surgery several years later 
Products, procedures and surgeries to enhance your appearance usually aren t covered by insurance 
creamsBotox injectionsChemical peelDermabrasionFace liftFacial fillers for wrinklesLaser resurfacingNeck liftShow more related Information 
What to expect from your doctorYou may be asked a number of questions, including 
What products, such as cleansers and moisturizers, do you use on your skin 
Did you expose your skin to sun when you were younger 
Diagnosis Diagnosis involves a medical history of repeat infections and a physical exam 
Blood tests and maybe genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis 
Treatment aims at boosting the immune system to prevent infections 
There also is quick treatment for infections as they happen 
This is a type of protein found in blood that contains antibodies against infections 
Reactions to gammaglobulin can include headache, chills, backache and nausea 
Reactions are more likely to happen during a viral infection, such as a cold 
Some people with XLA take antibiotics all the time to prevent infections 
Others take antibiotics for bacterial infections longer than do people without XLA 
Diagnosis There is no standard test to diagnose the yips 
A neurologic exam may be performed to rule out other potential causes 
Diagnosis of the yips is based on people describing their symptoms 
Changing your head position and where your eyes focus may help 
Try looking at the hole when you putt instead of down at the ball 
medicines Treatment with medicines taken by mouth may help manage the yips 
This can help limit muscle contractions and may calm the yips 
Rules regarding banned substances differ from sport to sport and organization to organization 
Information about the medical problems of your parents or siblings 
For yips, some questions to ask your healthcare team may include 
Do you have any brochures or printed material I can take with me 
Diagnosis Your health care provider usually bases a diagnosis on the following 
Your provider asks about your symptoms and review your medical history 
A sample of your blood is examined to see whether you have high gastrin levels 
Because gastrin levels can vary, this test may be repeated a few times 
For this test, your provider first measures your gastrin levels 
If you have Zollinger Ellison, your gastrin levels will rise dramatically 
It has a light and a camera at the end of it 
Endoscopy also can determine whether the stomach is making acid 
You will be asked to fast after midnight the night before the test 
This procedure uses an endoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe 
The probe makes it easier to spot tumors in your stomach, duodenum and pancreas 
Your provider may remove a tissue sample through the endoscope 
Your provider may use imaging techniques to look for tumors 
One test is a nuclear scan called somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 
If you have just one tumor, your provider may be able to remove it surgically 
In some cases, providers recommend other treatments to control tumor growth, including 
Removing as much of a liver tumor as possible, a procedure known as debulking 
Attempting to destroy the tumor by cutting off the blood supply, called embolization 
Using heat to destroy cancer cells with a procedure called radiofrequency ablation 
Treatment of excess acidExcess acid production can almost always be controlled 
medicines known as proton pump inhibitors are the first line of treatment 
These are effective medicines for controlling acid production in Zollinger Ellison syndrome 
They work by blocking the action of the tiny pumps within acid secreting cells 
However, this risk is small and should be weighed against their acid blocking benefits 
An oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancer 
However, don t stop taking these medications without asking your provider 
Also write down what you know of your family s medical history 
Questions to ask your doctorFor Zollinger Ellison syndrome, some basic questions to ask include 
What treatments are available for Zollinger Ellison syndrome, and which do you recommend for me 
How often do I need to come back for follow up appointments 
Is there a generic alternative for the medication you re prescribing for me 
Are there websites you recommend to learn more about Zollinger Ellison syndrome 
Are any other medical problems more likely to occur because I have Zollinger Ellison syndrome 
Have you ever been told you have a stomach ulcer 
Have you ever been told you have high blood calcium 
Overview Atrial fibrillation AFib is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm 
The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart related complications 
They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles 
But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light headedness 
Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent 
But it s a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke 
Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations 
Some people with atrial fibrillation AFib don t notice any symptoms 
The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours 
Some people have symptoms for as long as a week 
If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm 
This type of AFib is constant and lasts longer than months 
Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat 
In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can t be reset 
Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots 
Chest pain could mean that you re having a heart attack 
Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node 
The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat 
In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly 
The resting heart rate is typically to beats a minute 
But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic 
Heart diseases and health problems that can cause AFib include 
A heart problem you re born with, called a congenital heart defect 
A problem with the heart s natural pacemaker, called sick sinus syndrome 
Heart surgery or stress due to surgery or sickness may also cause AFib 
Some people who have atrial fibrillation have no known heart disease or heart damage 
Lifestyle habits that can trigger an AFib episode may include 
Taking medicines that contain stimulants, including cold and allergy medicines bought without a prescription 
Risk factors Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation AFib include 
Use of these substances may lead to the development of more serious arrhythmias 
Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart 
If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur 
An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families 
Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease 
This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart 
People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation 
Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats 
Complications Blood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation AFib 
The risk of stroke from AFib increases as you grow older 
Other health conditions also may increase the risk of a stroke due to AFib 
Eat a diet that s low in salt and saturated fat 
The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body 
An abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life threatening bleeding 
Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it s growing 
Treatment varies from regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery 
If you have a growing abdominal aortic aneurysm, you might notice 
Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly 
Several things can lead to the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, including 
High blood pressure can damage and weaken the aorta s walls 
These are diseases that cause blood vessels to become inflamed 
Rarely, infection by certain bacteria or fungi might cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm 
For example, being injured in a car accident can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm 
Smoking can weaken the walls of blood vessels, including the aorta 
This raises the risk of aortic aneurysm and aneurysm rupture 
Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age and older 
Men develop abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do 
People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms 
Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition 
Sudden, intense and persistent belly or back pain, which may feel like ripping or tearing 
Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area 
PreventionTo prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, do the following 
Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, chicken, fish, and low fat dairy products 
If your care provider prescribed medicines, take them as instructed 
Try to get at least minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity 
If you haven t been active, start slowly and build up 
Talk to your health care provider about what kinds of activities are right for you 
Overview Hyperhidrosis hi pur hi DROE sis is excessive sweating that s not always related to heat or exercise 
Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment 
If these don t help, you may need to try different medications and therapies 
And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body 
When to see a doctorSometimes excessive sweating is a sign of a serious condition 
The nervous system automatically triggers sweat glands when your body temperature rises 
Sweating also occurs, especially on your palms, when you re nervous 
It usually affects the palms, soles, underarms and sometimes the face 
There is no medical cause for this type of hyperhidrosis 
This type of hyperhidrosis may cause sweating all over the body 
People who sweat a lot are more prone to skin infections 
Having clammy or dripping hands and sweat soaked clothes can be embarrassing 
Your condition may affect your pursuit of work and educational goals 
The result is relatively painless swelling called a Bartholin s cyst 
In other cases, surgical drainage of the Bartholin s cyst is necessary 
If an infection occurs, antibiotics may be helpful to treat the infected Bartholin s cyst 
SymptomsIf you have a small, noninfected Bartholin s cyst, you may not notice it 
If the cyst grows, you might feel a lump or mass near your vaginal opening 
Although a cyst is usually painless, it can be tender 
A full blown infection of a Bartholin s cyst can occur in a matter of days 
A Bartholin s cyst or abscess typically occurs on only one side of the vaginal opening 
If the pain is severe, make an appointment with your doctor right away 
Causes Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin s cyst is a backup of fluid 
Complications A Bartholin s cyst or abscess may recur and again require treatment 
A person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds 
This type of seizure usually doesn t lead to physical injury 
But injury can result during the period when the person loses consciousness 
The seizure lasts about seconds, though it may last as long as seconds 
But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time 
When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities 
A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them 
If you re concerned that your child may be having seizures 
If your child has epilepsy but develops symptoms of a new type of seizure 
If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti seizure medicine 
If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours 
This may include activities such as eating or moving without awareness 
These are possible symptoms of a condition called status epilepticus 
Neurons typically send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them 
In people who have seizures, the brain s usual electrical activity is altered 
Risk factors Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including 
Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of and 
Nearly a quarter of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures 
Acanthosis nigricans ak an THOE sis NIE grih kuns tends to affect people with obesity 
It often appears in the armpits, groin and back of the neck 
The affected skin might be itchy, have an odor and develop skin tags 
Most people who have acanthosis nigricans have also become resistant to insulin 
Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that allows the body to process sugar 
High dose niacin, birth control pills, prednisone and other corticosteroids may cause acanthosis nigricans 
These include lymphoma and cancers of the stomach, colon and liver 
Risk factors The risk of acanthosis nigricans is higher in people who have obesity 
Complications People who have acanthosis nigricans are much more likely to develop type diabetes 
Once the esophagus is paralyzed, the muscle cannot work properly again 
But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery 
Researchers suspect it may be caused by a loss of nerve cells in the esophagus 
Very rarely, achalasia may be caused by an inherited genetic disorder or infection 
Episodes of more severe pain may occur after prolonged running, stair climbing or sprinting 
Seek immediate medical attention if the pain or disability is severe 
This tendon is used when you walk, run, jump or push up on your toes 
Risk factors A number of factors may increase your risk of Achilles tendinitis, including 
A naturally flat arch in your foot can put more strain on the Achilles tendon 
Obesity and tight calf muscles also can increase tendon strain 
Running in worn out shoes can increase your risk of Achilles tendinitis 
Certain types of antibiotics, called fluoroquinolones, have been associated with higher rates of Achilles tendinitis 
Avoid activities that place excessive stress on your tendons, such as hill running 
If you notice pain during a particular exercise, stop and rest 
This is especially important to avoid a recurrence of Achilles tendinitis 
It mainly occurs in people playing recreational sports, but it can happen to anyone 
If you overstretch your Achilles tendon, it can tear rupture completely or just partially 
For many people, however, nonsurgical treatment works just as well 
An inability to bend the foot downward or push off the injured leg when walking 
An inability to stand on the toes on the injured leg 
You rely on it virtually every time you walk and move your foot 
Ruptures often are caused by a sudden increase in the stress on your Achilles tendon 
Increasing the intensity of sports participation, especially in sports that involve jumping 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of Achilles tendon rupture include 
The peak age for Achilles tendon rupture is to 
Doctors sometimes inject steroids into an ankle joint to reduce pain and inflammation 
However, this medication can weaken nearby tendons and has been associated with Achilles tendon ruptures 
PreventionTo reduce your chance of developing Achilles tendon problems, follow these tips 
Stretch your calf until you feel a noticeable pull but not pain 
Calf strengthening exercises can also help the muscle and tendon absorb more force and prevent injury 
Alternate high impact sports, such as running, with low impact sports, such as walking, biking or swimming 
Achilles tendon injuries commonly occur after an abrupt increase in training intensity 
This backwash acid reflux can irritate the lining of your esophagus 
However, when acid reflux happens repeatedly over time, it can cause GERD 
Most people are able to manage the discomfort of GERD with lifestyle changes and medications 
And though it s uncommon, some may need surgery to ease symptoms 
If you have nighttime acid reflux, you might also experience 
These may be signs and symptoms of a heart attack 
Take over the counter medications for heartburn more than twice a week 
Risk factors Conditions that can increase your risk of GERD include 
Bulging of the top of the stomach up above the diaphragm hiatal hernia 
Eating certain foods triggers such as fatty or fried foods 
Complications Over time, chronic inflammation in your esophagus can cause 
Damage to the lower esophagus from stomach acid causes scar tissue to form 
The scar tissue narrows the food pathway, leading to problems with swallowing 
Damage from acid can cause changes in the tissue lining the lower esophagus 
These changes are associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer 
Overview Infant reflux is when a baby spits up liquid or food 
It happens when stomach contents move back up from a baby s stomach into the esophagus 
The esophagus is the muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach 
Sometimes called gastroesophageal reflux GER , the condition becomes less common as a baby gets older 
It s unusual for infant reflux to continue after age months 
GERD is a more serious form of GER that causes serious health issues 
SymptomsIn most cases, infant reflux isn t a cause for concern 
When to see a doctorSee your baby s health care provider if your baby 
Consistently spits up forcefully, causing stomach contents to shoot out of the mouth 
Spits up blood or stomach contents that look like coffee grounds 
Has difficulty breathing or a cough that won t go away 
Some of these symptoms may indicate serious but treatable conditions 
These include GERD or a blockage in the digestive tract 
Sometimes, infant reflux can be caused by more serious conditions, such as 
The reflux has enough acid to irritate and damage the lining of the esophagus 
In pyloric stenosis, the valve thickens and becomes larger than it should 
A protein in cow s milk is the most common trigger 
This causes irregular tilting and rotation of the head, and movements that resemble seizures 
But some things make it more likely that a baby will experience infant reflux 
Conditions that affect the nervous system, such as cerebral palsy 
Your knee may swell, feel unstable and become too painful to bear weight 
A proper training program may help reduce the risk of an ACL injury 
A loud pop or a popping sensation in the knee 
A feeling of instability or giving way with weight bearing 
Causes Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect one bone to another 
A mild injury may stretch the ligament but leave it intact 
Being female possibly due to differences in anatomy, muscle strength and hormonal influences 
Participating in certain sports, such as soccer, football, basketball, gymnastics and downhill skiing 
Using faulty movement patterns, such as moving the knees inward during a squat 
Using poorly maintained sports equipment, such as ski bindings that aren t adjusted properly 
Arthritis may occur even if you have surgery to reconstruct the ligament 
PreventionProper training and exercise can help reduce the risk of ACL injury 
Training and exercise emphasizing proper technique and knee position when jumping and landing from jumps 
Training to improve technique when performing pivoting and cutting movements 
GearWear footwear and padding that is appropriate for your sport to help prevent injury 
Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages 
Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent 
Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin 
The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems 
SymptomsAcne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition 
Pimples pustules , which are papules with pus at their tips 
Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders 
For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation 
This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives 
Seek emergency medical help if after using a skin product you experience 
Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead 
Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too 
Stress doesn t cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse 
Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne 
Nonoily cosmetics don t interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs 
Pitted skin acne scars and thick scars keloids can remain long term after acne has healed 
Risk factors Risk factors for acne include 
People of all ages can get acne, but it s most common in teenagers 
If both of your parents had acne, you re likely to develop it too 
This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks 
The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring 
Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty, usually before age 
It can persist for many years and worsen over time 
Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications 
Also, Black people are more likely to develop this disease than people of other races 
SymptomsHidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body 
Blackheads appear in small, pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs 
Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor 
Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps 
These wounds heal slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus 
When to see a doctorEarly diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa is key to effective treatment 
Experts think it could be connected to hormones, genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking or excess weight 
Risk factors Factors that increase your chance of developing hidradenitis suppurativa include 
The risk of hidradenitis suppurativa is higher for people in their teens and s 
Females are more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa than males 
The condition occurs most in Black people, possibly due to genetic factors 
Hidradenitis suppurativa is more common and severe in people who are overweight 
Complications Persistent and severe hidradenitis suppurativa can cause complications, including 
The wounds may heal but leave ropelike scars or pitted skin 
The most common sites for hidradenitis suppurativa also contain many lymph nodes 
This pain is much worse than diseases such as psoriasis 
An acoustic neuroma develops from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular nerve 
Treatments for an acoustic neuroma include monitoring, radiation and surgical removal 
Symptoms may occur because of the tumor s effects on the hearing and balance nerves 
Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma 
Hearing loss usually occurs on one side or is worse on one side 
Facial numbness and, very rarely, weakness or loss of muscle movement 
Rarely, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life threatening 
Experts don t know what causes this problem with the gene 
Often there is no known cause for an acoustic neuroma 
This gene change is inherited in people with a rare disorder called neurofibromatosis type 
However, neurofibromatosis type only accounts for about of acoustic neuroma cases 
Neurofibromatosis type is known as an autosomal dominant disorder 
Each child of an affected parent has a chance of inheriting it 
Fluid can build up in your head, a condition known as hydrocephalus 
Overview Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS , is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition 
It s caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV 
Thanks to treatment, most people in the U S don t get AIDS 
HIV is spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom 
This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI 
But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse 
Antiviral treatments for HIV have reduced AIDS deaths around the world 
This stage may last a few days to several weeks 
Swollen lymph glands, also called nodes, mainly on the neck 
These symptoms can be so mild that you might not notice them 
Swollen lymph glands, which are often one of the first symptoms of HIV infection 
Progression to AIDSBetter antiviral treatments have greatly decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide 
Untreated, HIV most often turns into AIDS in about to years 
Some people get opportunistic infections during the acute stage of the disease 
Constant white spots or lesions on the tongue or in the mouth 
It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding 
These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease 
The fewer CD T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes 
You may become infected if you have vaginal or anal sex with an infected partner 
Sometimes the virus may be transmitted through blood from a donor 
Hospitals and blood banks screen the blood supply for HIV 
So this risk is small in places where these precautions are taken 
Pregnant people who have HIV can pass the virus to their babies 
How HIV doesn t spreadYou can t become infected with HIV through casual contact 
Risk factors Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can have HIV AIDS 
Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex 
Your risk of HIV increases if you have more than one sexual partner 
If you share needles and syringes, you can be exposed to infected blood 
It doesn t happen as often in the U S because of treatments for HIV AIDS 
But PCP is still the most common cause of pneumonia in people infected with HIV 
It causes a thick, white coating on the mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina 
Worldwide, TB is a leading cause of death among people with AIDS 
It s less common in the U S thanks to the wide use of HIV medicines 
A healthy immune system makes the virus inactive, but it stays in the body 
Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection linked to HIV 
This infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats 
The parasites then can spread to other animals and humans 
In people with Black or brown skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black 
Untreated HIV AIDS can cause a great deal of weight loss 
Diarrhea, weakness and fever often happen with the weight loss 
HIV can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness, depression, anxiety and difficulty walking 
PreventionThere s no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for HIV AIDS 
The oral medicines are emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Truvada and emtricitabine tenofovir alafenamide fumarate Descovy 
After two once monthly shots, Apretude is given every two months 
The shot is an option in place of a daily PrEP pill 
You need an HIV test before you start taking any PrEP 
You need to take the pills every day or closely follow the shot schedule 
You still need to practice safe sex to protect against other STIs 
If your blood tests show no virus, that means your viral load can t be detected 
Then you won t transmit the virus to anyone else through sex 
Use post exposure prophylaxis, also called PEP, if you ve been exposed to HIV 
Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex 
If you use a lubricant, make sure it s water based 
Oil based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break 
It s important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you re HIV positive 
If you use needles to inject illicit drugs, make sure the needles are sterile 
But if you get treatment during pregnancy, you can lessen your baby s risk greatly 
When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size 
In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism 
This can lead to serious sometimes even life threatening health problems 
SymptomsA common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet 
Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years 
Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones 
Enlarged facial features, including the facial bones, lips, nose and tongue 
A deepened, husky voice due to enlarged vocal cords and sinuses 
But early diagnosis is important so that you can start getting proper care 
Acromegaly can lead to serious health problems if it s not treated 
GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth 
In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production 
Most acromegaly cases are caused by a noncancerous benign tumor adenoma of the pituitary gland 
Complications If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to major health problems 
Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep 
Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse 
Untreated, acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death 
Flat to slightly raised patch or bump on the top layer of skin 
New patches or bumps on sun exposed areas of the head, neck, hands and forearms 
Have red or blond hair and blue or light colored eyes 
Have a history of a lot of sun exposure or sunburn 
Complications If treated early, actinic keratosis can be cleared up or removed 
If left untreated, some of these spots might progress to squamous cell carcinoma 
This is a type of cancer that usually isn t life threatening if detected and treated early 
Take these steps to protect your skin from the sun 
Or protect them with shade, hats, and clothing that covers the arms and legs 
This provides more protection than does a baseball cap or golf visor 
Check your skin regularly and report changes to your health care provider 
With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp 
Examine the tops and undersides of your arms and hands 
A heart attack happens when cell death damages or destroys heart tissue 
A heart attack also is known as a myocardial infarction 
Unstable angina occurs when blood flow to the heart decreases 
It s not severe enough to cause cell death or a heart attack 
But the reduced blood flow may increase your risk of a heart attack 
Acute coronary syndrome often causes severe chest pain or discomfort 
It is a medical emergency that needs a diagnosis and care right away 
The goals of treatment include improving blood flow, treating complications and preventing future problems 
This is often described as aching, pressure, tightness or burning 
Pain that starts in the chest and spreads to other parts of the body 
These areas include the shoulders, arms, upper belly area, back, neck or jaw 
When to see a doctorAcute coronary syndrome is a medical emergency 
Chest pain or discomfort can be a symptom of many life threatening conditions 
Get emergency help for a diagnosis and appropriate care right away 
The blood vessels that supply the heart also are known as coronary arteries 
When a fatty deposit ruptures or splits, a blood clot forms 
This clot blocks the flow of blood to heart muscles 
The death of cells results in damage to muscle tissues 
When acute coronary syndrome doesn t result in cell death, it is called unstable angina 
Personal or family history of chest pain, heart attacks or stroke 
History of high blood pressure, preeclampsia or diabetes during pregnancy, and early menopause 
Acute flaccid myelitis AFM Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
If you or your child develops symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis, seek immediate medical care 
Hospitalization is needed and sometimes a ventilator is required for breathing support 
SymptomsThe most common signs and symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis include 
Severe symptoms involve respiratory failure, due to the muscles involved in breathing becoming weak 
It s also possible to experience life threatening body temperature changes and blood pressure instability 
Respiratory illnesses and fever from enteroviruses are common especially in children 
It s not clear why some people with an enterovirus infection develop acute flaccid myelitis 
In the United States many viruses, including enteroviruses, circulate between August and November 
This is when acute flaccid myelitis outbreaks tend to occur 
Risk factors Acute flaccid myelitis mainly affects young children 
Complications Muscle weakness caused by acute flaccid myelitis can continue for months to years 
However, preventing a viral infection can help reduce the risk of developing acute flaccid myelitis 
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve 
The word acute in acute myelogenous leukemia denotes the disease s rapid progression 
Unusual bleeding, such as frequent nosebleeds and bleeding from the gums 
A cell s DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do 
When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control 
The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called myeloblasts 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of acute myelogenous leukemia AML include 
Acute myelogenous leukemia is most common in adults age and older 
Men are more likely to develop acute myelogenous leukemia than are women 
Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene, is linked to a greater risk of AML 
AML is linked to cigarette smoke, which contains benzene and other known cancer causing chemicals 
Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of AML 
Weakness and tingling in your hands and feet are usually the first symptoms 
These sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body 
In its most severe form Guillain Barre syndrome is a medical emergency 
Most people with the condition must be hospitalized to receive treatment 
But two thirds of patients report symptoms of an infection in the six weeks preceding 
These include a COVID , respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection or Zika virus 
Although most people recover completely from Guillain Barre syndrome, some severe cases can be fatal 
Some people may have lasting effects from it, such as weakness, numbness or fatigue 
Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face 
As Guillain Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis 
A pins and needles sensation in your fingers, toes, ankles or wrists 
Weakness in your legs that spreads to your upper body 
Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night 
Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy AIDP , the most common form in North America and Europe 
Miller Fisher syndrome MFS , in which paralysis starts in the eyes 
MFS is less common in the U S but more common in Asia 
But AMAN and AMSAN are more frequent in China, Japan and Mexico 
Seek emergency medical help if you have any of these severe signs or symptoms 
Tingling that started in your feet or toes and is now moving up your body 
Difficulty catching your breath or shortness of breath when lying flat 
Guillain Barre syndrome is a serious condition that requires immediate hospitalization because it can worsen rapidly 
The sooner appropriate treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome 
The disorder usually appears days or weeks after a respiratory or digestive tract infection 
There have been cases reported following infection with the Zika virus 
Guillain Barre syndrome may occur after infection with the COVID virus 
In AIDP, the nerves protective covering myelin sheath is damaged 
The damage prevents nerves from transmitting signals to your brain, causing weakness, numbness or paralysis 
Most commonly, infection with campylobacter, a type of bacteria often found in undercooked poultry 
Because nerves control your movements and body functions, people with Guillain Barre may experience 
Sluggish bowel function and urine retention may result from Guillain Barre syndrome 
People who are immobile due to Guillain Barre syndrome are at risk of developing blood clots 
Being immobile also puts you at risk of developing bedsores pressure sores 
Severe, early symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome significantly increase the risk of serious long term complications 
Rarely, death may occur from complications such as respiratory distress syndrome and heart attacks 
Acute kidney failure can be fatal and requires intensive treatment 
If you re otherwise in good health, you may recover normal or nearly normal kidney function 
Fluid retention, causing swelling in your legs, ankles or feet 
You have a condition that slows blood flow to your kidneys 
Use of aspirin, ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others , naproxen sodium Aleve, others or related drugs 
Blood clots in the veins and arteries in and around the kidneys 
Glomerulonephritis gloe mer u loe nuh FRY tis , inflammation of the tiny filters in the kidneys glomeruli 
Hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that results from premature destruction of red blood cells 
Infection, such as with the virus that causes coronavirus disease 
Medications, such as certain chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics and dyes used during imaging tests 
Scleroderma, a group of rare diseases affecting the skin and connective tissues 
Conditions that can increase your risk of acute kidney failure include 
Being hospitalized, especially for a serious condition that requires intensive care 
Blockages in the blood vessels in your arms or legs peripheral artery disease 
If the lining that covers your heart pericardium becomes inflamed, you may experience chest pain 
Occasionally, acute kidney failure causes permanent loss of kidney function, or end stage renal disease 
Acute kidney failure can lead to loss of kidney function and, ultimately, death 
PreventionAcute kidney failure is often difficult to predict or prevent 
But you may reduce your risk by taking care of your kidneys 
Pay attention to labels when taking over the counter OTC pain medications 
Taking too much of these medications may increase your risk of kidney injury 
This is especially true if you have pre existing kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure 
Work with your doctor to manage kidney and other chronic conditions 
It s most commonly caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen 
Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly 
Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment 
In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure 
Outside of the United States, acetaminophen is known as paracetamol 
Some prescription medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure 
Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E can cause acute liver failure 
Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure 
Extreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure 
Some cases of acute liver failure have no obvious cause 
A failing liver cannot make enough clotting factors, which help blood to clot 
Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is common with this condition 
PreventionReduce your risk of acute liver failure by taking care of your liver 
Even over the counter and herbal medicines can interfere with prescription drugs you re taking 
Accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids can spread hepatitis viruses 
Take similar protective measures when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals 
Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
Lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes in and around the neck, armpits, abdomen or groin 
Many signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia mimic those of the flu 
If signs and symptoms don t improve as expected, make an appointment with your doctor 
The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called lymphoblasts 
It s not clear what causes the DNA mutations that can lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia include 
Radiation sickness also is called acute radiation syndrome or radiation poisoning 
Although radiation sickness is serious and often fatal, it s rare 
SymptomsThe severity of radiation sickness symptoms depends on how much radiation you ve absorbed 
Symptoms also are affected by the type of exposure, such as total or partial body 
The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is 
For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation 
Initial symptomsThe first symptoms of treatable radiation sickness are usually nausea and vomiting 
If you ve had a mild exposure, it may take hours to weeks before symptoms begin 
But with high exposure, symptoms can begin minutes to days after exposure 
If you know you ve been overexposed to radiation, seek emergency medical care 
Causes Radiation sickness is caused by being exposed to a high dose of radiation 
Radiation sickness happens when high energy radiation damages or destroys certain cells in the body 
Dealing with the uncertainty of a mysterious and potentially fatal illness 
Worrying about the eventual risk of cancer due to radiation exposure 
Turn off fans, air conditioners and heating units that bring air in from outside 
Stay tuned to your emergency response network or local news 
EvacuateIf you re advised to evacuate, follow the instructions provided by your local authorities 
Try to stay calm and move quickly and in an orderly manner 
Be aware that most emergency vehicles and shelters won t accept pets 
This deprives your organs of the oxygen they need to function 
ARDS typically occurs in people who are already critically ill or who have significant injuries 
The risk of death increases with age and severity of illness 
Normally, a protective membrane keeps this fluid in the vessels 
Severe cases of pneumonia usually affect all five lobes of the lungs 
Pancreatitis inflammation of the pancreas , massive blood transfusions and burns 
You re especially at risk if you have a widespread infection in your bloodstream sepsis 
People who have a history of chronic alcoholism are at higher risk of developing ARDS 
Complications If you have ARDS, you can develop other medical problems while in the hospital 
However, many survivors end up with potentially serious and sometimes lasting effects 
Most ARDS survivors also report going through a period of depression, which is treatable 
Being in the hospital and on a ventilator can cause your muscles to weaken 
Acute sinusitis makes it hard for the sinuses to drain 
Acute sinusitis can make it hard to breathe through the nose 
The area around the eyes and the face might feel swollen 
The common cold is the usual cause of acute sinusitis 
Home remedies might be all that s needed to treat acute sinusitis 
Sinusitis that lasts more than weeks even with medical treatment is called chronic sinusitis 
Contact your health care provider if you have any of the following 
Causes Acute sinusitis is an infection caused by a virus 
Sometimes, sinuses that are blocked for a time might get a bacterial infection 
Risk factors The following can raise the risk of getting sinusitis 
A problem inside the nose, such as a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps or tumors 
A medical condition such as cystic fibrosis or an immune system disorder such as HIV AIDS 
Acute sinusitis can be a flare up of a long term problem known as chronic sinusitis 
This infection affects the membranes and fluid around the brain and spinal cord 
If the infection spreads to the eye socket, it can reduce vision or cause blindness 
PreventionTake these steps to help lower your risk of getting acute sinusitis 
Try to stay away from people who have colds or other infections 
Wash your hands often with soap and water, such as before meals 
Work with your health care provider to keep symptoms under control 
Use a machine that adds moisture to the air, known as a humidifier 
Be sure the humidifier stays clean and free of mold with regular, complete cleaning 
Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that s sometimes called alcoholism 
Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink 
Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use 
Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use 
Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol 
Using alcohol in situations where it s not safe, such as when driving or swimming 
Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk alcohol intoxication and symptoms of withdrawal 
Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases 
You can also have periods called blackouts, where you don t remember events 
Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death 
It can occur within several hours to to days later 
 ounces milliliters of regular beer about alcohol 
 to ounces to milliliters of malt liquor about alcohol 
 ounces milliliters of hard liquor or distilled spirits about alcohol 
Because denial is common, you may feel like you don t have a problem with drinking 
Consider talking with someone who has had a problem with drinking but has stopped 
For young people, the influence of parents, peers and other role models can impact risk 
In some people, the initial reaction may feel like an increase in energy 
Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain 
A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life threatening coma or death 
Motor vehicle accidents and other types of accidental injury, such as drowning 
Increased likelihood of committing violent crimes or being the victim of a crime 
Engaging in risky, unprotected sex, or experiencing sexual abuse or date rape 
Over time, heavy drinking can cause irreversible destruction and scarring of liver tissue cirrhosis 
Heavy drinking can damage your pancreas or lead to inflammation of the pancreas pancreatitis 
Even a single binge can cause serious irregular heartbeats arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation 
Heavy drinking can cause men to have difficulty maintaining an erection erectile dysfunction 
Bone loss can lead to thinning bones osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures 
Alcohol can also damage bone marrow, which makes blood cells 
This can cause a low platelet count, which may result in bruising and bleeding 
Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer 
Loss of interest in activities and hobbies and in personal appearance 
Red eyes, slurred speech, problems with coordination and memory lapses 
Difficulties or changes in relationships with friends, such as joining a new crowd 
Compulsive gambling is a serious condition that can destroy lives 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of compulsive gambling gambling disorder can include 
Needing to gamble with increasing amounts of money to get the same thrill 
Trying to control, cut back or stop gambling, without success 
Feeling restless or irritable when you try to cut down on gambling 
Gambling to escape problems or relieve feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety or depression 
Trying to get back lost money by gambling more chasing losses 
Lying to family members or others to hide the extent of your gambling 
Risking or losing important relationships, a job, or school or work opportunities because of gambling 
Asking others to bail you out of financial trouble because you gambled money away 
Some people may turn to theft or fraud to get gambling money 
Causes Exactly what causes someone to gamble compulsively isn t well understood 
People who gamble compulsively often have substance misuse problems, personality disorders, depression or anxiety 
Compulsive gambling is more common in younger and middle aged people 
Gambling during childhood or the teenage years increases the risk of developing compulsive gambling 
But compulsive gambling in the older adult population can also be a problem 
Women who gamble typically start later in life and may become addicted more quickly 
But gambling patterns among men and women have become increasingly similar 
Medications used to treat Parkinson s disease and restless legs syndrome 
Complications Compulsive gambling can have profound and long lasting consequences for your life, such as 
Overview Nicotine dependence occurs when you need nicotine and can t stop using it 
Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes it hard to quit 
Nicotine produces pleasing effects in your brain, but these effects are temporary 
The more you smoke, the more nicotine you need to feel good 
When you try to stop, you experience unpleasant mental and physical changes 
Regardless of how long you ve smoked, stopping can improve your health 
It isn t easy but you can break your dependence on nicotine 
SymptomsFor some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence 
You ve made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop 
Causes Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking 
Nicotine reaches the brain within seconds of taking a puff 
Nicotine quickly becomes part of your daily routine and intertwined with your habits and feelings 
Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years 
The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited 
Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers 
Children with friends who smoke are also more likely to try it 
People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers 
But you may not realize just how many different health problems smoking causes 
In addition, smoking causes lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis 
Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for type diabetes 
Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, the flu and bronchitis 
Children whose parents smoke are more prone to worsening asthma, ear infections and colds 
The best way to keep children from smoking is to not smoke yourself 
Treatment involves taking hormones to replace those that are missing 
Then a stress, such as illness or injury, makes symptoms worse 
Acute adrenal failure, known as addisonian crisisSometimes the symptoms of Addison s disease appear suddenly 
Causes Addison s disease is caused by damage to the adrenal glands 
The outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids 
These hormones, including cortisol, affect the body s ability to turn food into energy 
In all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones 
Then it can t make enough hormones, a condition called primary adrenal insufficiency 
This is usually the result of an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself 
Medicines that block the body s ability to make glucocorticoid, such as ketoconazole and etomidate Amidate 
insufficiencyThe pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH 
ACTH in turn causes the adrenal cortex to make its hormones 
Too little ACTH can cause the adrenal glands to make too little glucocorticoids and androgens 
Most symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency are similar to those of primary adrenal insufficiency 
But the following may raise the risk of developing Addison s disease 
Certain genetic changes that affect the pituitary or adrenal glands 
These include gene changes that cause the inherited disease congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
Other autoimmune endocrine conditions, such as hypothyroidism or type diabetes 
PreventionAddison s disease can t be prevented, but there are ways to avoid an addisonian crisis 
You may need to learn how to increase your dose of corticosteroids 
Some people with Addison s disease worry about serious side effects from hydrocortisone or prednisone 
That s because the dose prescribed replaces the amount that s missing 
Also called mesenteric adenitis, the condition mainly affects children and teens 
Unlike appendicitis or intussusception, mesenteric lymphadenitis usually clears up on its own 
Depending on what s causing the condition, symptoms also might include 
When to see a doctorPain in the stomach area is common in children and teens 
So it can be hard to know when to seek medical advice 
Call a healthcare professional right away for a child who has 
Causes The most common cause of mesenteric lymphadenitis is a viral infection, such as gastroenteritis 
Other causes of mesenteric lymphadenitis include bacterial infection, inflammatory bowel disease and lymphoma 
Doctors aren t sure what causes adenomyosis, but the disease usually resolves after menopause 
For women who have severe discomfort from adenomyosis, hormonal treatments can help 
Severe cramping or sharp, knifelike pelvic pain during menstruation dysmenorrhea 
Regardless of how adenomyosis develops, its growth depends on the body s circulating estrogen 
Risk factors Risk factors for adenomyosis include 
Prior uterine surgery, such as C section, fibroid removal, or dilatation and curettage D C 
However, current research suggests that the condition might also be common in younger women 
Although not harmful, the pain and excessive bleeding associated with adenomyosis can disrupt your lifestyle 
While treatment won t cure ADHD, it can help a great deal with symptoms 
Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in outcome 
SymptomsThe primary features of ADHD include inattention and hyperactive impulsive behavior 
ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood 
For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive 
This is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive impulsive symptoms 
InattentionA child who shows a pattern of inattention may often 
Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork 
Have difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores 
Avoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework 
Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils 
Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores 
Hyperactivity and impulsivityA child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often 
Fidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat 
Have difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations 
Run around or climb in situations when it s not appropriate 
Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest 
In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do 
Causes While the exact cause of ADHD is not clear, research efforts continue 
Risk factors Risk factors for ADHD may include 
Blood relatives, such as a parent or sibling, with ADHD or another mental health disorder 
Although sugar is a popular suspect in causing hyperactivity, there s no reliable proof of this 
Are more likely to have trouble interacting with and being accepted by peers and adults 
Are at increased risk of alcohol and drug abuse and other delinquent behavior 
However, children with ADHD are more likely than others to also have conditions such as 
Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, characterized by irritability and problems tolerating frustration 
Learning disabilities, including problems with reading, writing, understanding and communicating 
Anxiety disorders, which may cause overwhelming worry and nervousness, and include obsessive compulsive disorder OCD 
Mood disorders, including depression and bipolar disorder, which includes depression as well as manic behavior 
For example, don t drink alcohol, use recreational drugs or smoke cigarettes 
Protect your child from exposure to pollutants and toxins, including cigarette smoke and lead paint 
Though it s called adult ADHD, symptoms start in early childhood and continue into adulthood 
In some cases, ADHD is not recognized or diagnosed until the person is an adult 
Adult ADHD symptoms may not be as clear as ADHD symptoms in children 
Treatment for adult ADHD is similar to treatment for childhood ADHD 
In adults, the main features of ADHD may include difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness and restlessness 
These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood 
Different types of health care professionals may diagnose and supervise treatment for ADHD 
Seek a provider who has training and experience in caring for adults with ADHD 
While the exact cause of ADHD is not clear, research efforts continue 
Factors that may be involved in the development of ADHD include 
ADHD can run in families, and studies indicate that genes may play a role 
Certain environmental factors also may increase risk, such as lead exposure as a child 
Problems with the central nervous system at key moments in development may play a role 
Your mother smoked, drank alcohol or used drugs during pregnancy 
Many adults with ADHD also have depression, bipolar disorder or another mood disorder 
Anxiety disorders may cause overwhelming worry, nervousness and other symptoms 
Anxiety can be made worse by the challenges and setbacks caused by ADHD 
Overview Frozen shoulder, also called adhesive capsulitis, involves stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint 
Over time, symptoms get better, usually within to years 
This might happen after having surgery or breaking an arm 
Sometimes treatment involves corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint 
It s unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder 
But some people can develop it in the other shoulder, usually within five years 
Any movement of the shoulder causes pain, and the shoulder s ability to move becomes limited 
For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep 
Causes The shoulder joint is enclosed in a capsule of connective tissue 
Risk factors Certain factors may increase the risk of developing frozen shoulder 
Age and sexPeople and older, particularly women, are more likely to have frozen shoulder 
Restricted movement can be the result of many factors, including 
Systemic diseasesPeople who have certain diseases appear more likely to develop frozen shoulder 
Most of the time, people get used to such changes within a few months 
Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world 
Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy 
Feeling irritable or like you can t handle anything and don t know where to start 
Not doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills 
Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event 
These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event 
But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months 
This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed 
Symptoms of adjustment disorder usually get better when the stress eases 
But sometimes the stressful event continues to be a part of your life 
If you have concerns about your child s behavior, talk with your child s doctor 
If you re thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for counseling 
In the U S , call or text to reach the Suicide Crisis Lifeline 
Causes Adjustment disorders are caused by major changes or stressors in your life 
Major stress as a child, such as bullying or difficulties with school 
Major changes in life, such as retirement, having a baby or moving away 
Life threatening experiences, such as physical assault, combat or natural disaster 
More than one major change or bad experience happening at the same time 
Other mental health conditions, such as major depression, intense anxiety or post traumatic stress disorder 
In advance, increase your healthy habits and ask your friends and family for support 
Remind yourself that stressful situations pass in time and that you can get through them 
Adnexal tumors most often aren t cancerous, but they can be cancerous 
Diagnosis of adnexal tumors involves a careful physical exam, imaging tests and, sometimes, surgery 
Treatment for adnexal tumors depends on the specific location and types of cells involved 
Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking cognitive , behavior or emotions 
SymptomsSchizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions 
Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 
Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age is extremely rare 
Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases 
Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions 
Lack of motivation for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school 
These are false beliefs that are not based in reality 
These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don t exist 
Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated 
This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation 
Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks 
This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally 
Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure 
Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be 
Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can t recognize what s wrong 
As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable 
Suicidal thoughts and behaviorSuicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia 
Complications Left untreated, childhood schizophrenia can result in severe emotional, behavioral and health problems 
Complications associated with schizophrenia may occur in childhood or later, such as 
Adrenal cancer, also called adrenocortical cancer, can occur at any age 
When adrenal cancer is found early, there is a chance for cure 
Most growths that form in the adrenal glands are noncancerous benign 
Benign adrenal tumors, such as adenoma or pheochromocytoma, also can develop in the adrenal glands 
Hormone changes in men that might cause enlarged breast tissue and shrinking testicles 
When this happens, the abnormal cells accumulate and form a tumor 
The tumor cells can break away and spread metastasize to other parts of the body 
Overview Benign adrenal tumors are noncancerous masses that form in the adrenal glands 
You have two adrenal glands, one located above each kidney 
Each gland contains two tissue types the cortex and the medulla 
Benign adrenal tumors that develop in the cortex are also called adrenal adenomas 
Those that develop in the medulla are also called pheochromocytomas fee o kroe moe sy TOE muhs 
Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don t need treatment 
But sometimes these tumors secrete high levels of certain hormones that can cause complications 
In these cases, benign adrenal tumor treatment may include surgery or medications 
X linked ALD affects males more severely than females, who carry the disease 
This form of X linked ALD usually occurs between ages and 
The white matter of the brain is progressively damaged leukodystrophy , and symptoms worsen over time 
If not diagnosed early, childhood onset ALD may lead to death within five to years 
Women who are carriers for ALD may develop a mild form of adrenomyeloneuropathy 
Overview Adult Still disease is a rare type of inflammatory arthritis 
The condition can occur in some people as a single episode that goes away 
In other people, the condition doesn t go away, or it goes away but comes back 
Treatment involves medicine to reduce pain and help control the disease 
SymptomsMost people with adult Still disease have a combination of the following symptoms 
Fever may rise to at least degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius 
The fever may spike once or twice a day for a week or longer 
The rash usually appears on the trunk, arms or legs 
This is one of the first symptoms of adult Still disease 
The lymph nodes in the neck might be swollen and tender 
Joints especially in the knees and wrists might be stiff, painful and inflamed 
The pain can be severe enough to disrupt daily activities 
Symptoms of this disorder can differ from person to person 
Causes The cause of adult Still disease is not known 
Some researchers suspect it might be triggered by a viral or bacterial infection 
Risk factors Age is the main risk factor for adult Still disease 
The chronic swelling and irritation that occurs with adult Still disease can damage the joints 
The most commonly involved joints are the knees and wrists 
Sometimes other joints, including the neck, foot, finger and hip joints, also are affected 
Adult Still disease can inflame the saclike covering of the heart, called the pericardium 
The disease can also inflame the muscular part of the heart, called the myocardium 
Inflammation may cause fluid to build up around the lungs 
When this happens, it can be hard to take deep breaths 
This is a rare but serious complication of adult Still disease 
Age spots liver spots Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Age spots liver spots Overview Age spots are small, flat dark areas on the skin 
Age spots are also called sunspots, liver spots and solar lentigines 
You can help prevent age spots by regularly using sunscreen and avoiding the sun 
Range from freckle size to about inch millimeters across 
When to see a doctorAge spots don t require medical care 
Have your doctor look at spots that are black or have changed in appearance 
These changes can be signs of melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer 
Use of commercial tanning lamps and beds also can cause age spots 
Risk factors You might be more likely to develop age spots if you 
Have a history of frequent or intense sun exposure or sunburn 
Overview Dry macular degeneration is a common eye disorder among people over 
Dry macular degeneration may start in one eye before developing in the other eye 
It also may develop in both eyes at the same time 
But having dry macular degeneration doesn t mean you ll lose all your sight 
Vision loss is typically central, and people retain their peripheral vision 
Early detection and self care measures may delay vision loss due to dry macular degeneration 
SymptomsDry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain 
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close up work 
A well defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision 
If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision 
This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye 
And the condition doesn t affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness 
Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age related macular degeneration 
The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years 
You notice changes, such as distortion or blind spots, in your central vision 
Causes No one knows exactly what causes dry macular degeneration 
Over time, tissue in the macula may thin and lose cells responsible for vision 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of macular degeneration include 
With profound loss of vision, people may see visual hallucinations 
to have routine eye exams to identify early signs of macular degeneration 
The following measures may help reduce your risk of developing dry macular degeneration 
Smokers are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are nonsmokers 
These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration 
Omega fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration 
It s usually caused by blood vessels that leak fluid or blood into the macula MAK u luh 
Wet macular degeneration is one of two types of age related macular degeneration 
The other type, dry macular degeneration, is more common and less severe 
Early detection and treatment of wet macular degeneration may help reduce vision loss 
SymptomsWet macular degeneration symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen quickly 
Macular degeneration doesn t affect side vision, so it doesn t cause total blindness 
Of all people with age related macular degeneration, about have the wet form 
Sometimes irregular new blood vessels grow from the choroid under and into the macula 
These blood vessels may leak fluid or blood, affecting the retina s function 
Vision loss caused by fluid buildup in the back of the eye 
This may cause irregularities in the macula layers, resulting in vision loss or distortion 
The following measures may help reduce your risk of developing wet macular degeneration 
Smokers are more likely to develop macular degeneration than nonsmokers 
Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of diseases called myeloproliferative disorders 
Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away 
Others with more serious forms of the disease might need aggressive treatments right away 
Treatment for myelofibrosis, which focuses on relieving symptoms, can involve a variety of options 
In its very early stages, many people don t experience signs or symptoms 
As disruption of normal blood cell production increases, signs and symptoms may include 
Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia 
Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen 
Causes Myelofibrosis occurs when bone marrow stem cells develop changes mutations in their DNA 
It s not clear what causes the genetic mutations in bone marrow stem cells 
In people with myelofibrosis, the normally spongy bone marrow becomes scarred 
Several specific gene mutations have been identified in people with myelofibrosis 
The most common is the Janus kinase JAK gene mutation 
Some people with myelofibrosis don t have any identifiable gene mutations 
Myelofibrosis can affect anyone, but it s most often diagnosed in people older than 
Myelofibrosis has been linked to exposure to industrial chemicals such as toluene and benzene 
People exposed to very high levels of radiation have an increased risk of myelofibrosis 
Complications Complications that may result from myelofibrosis include 
A severely enlarged spleen can cause abdominal pain and back pain 
They then avoid the places where it may happen again 
The fear can be so overwhelming that you may feel you can t leave your home 
Agoraphobia treatment can be challenging because it means confronting your fears 
Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores 
Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train 
Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation 
Your fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer 
Panic disorder and agoraphobiaSome people have panic disorder in addition to agoraphobia 
Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks 
You might think that you re totally losing control, having a heart attack or even dying 
Females are diagnosed with agoraphobia more often than males are 
Having panic disorder or other excessive fear reactions, called phobias 
Responding to panic attacks with too much fear and avoidance 
Experiencing stressful life events, such as abuse, the death of a parent or being attacked 
If your agoraphobia is severe, you may not even be able to leave your home 
But anxiety tends to increase the more you avoid situations that you fear 
This can help you feel more comfortable in those places 
Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait 
Airplane ear is also called ear barotrauma, barotitis media or aerotitis media 
However, for a severe case of airplane ear, you might need to see a doctor 
When an airplane climbs or descends, the air pressure changes rapidly 
The eustachian tube often can t react fast enough, which causes the symptoms of airplane ear 
Complications Airplane ear usually isn t serious and responds to self care 
You can suck on candy or chew gum to help you swallow 
Avoid overuse, however, because nasal sprays taken over three to four days can increase congestion 
If you have allergies, take your medication about an hour before your flight 
These earplugs slowly equalize the pressure against your eardrum during ascents and descents 
You can purchase these at drugstores, airport gift shops or a hearing clinic 
However, you ll still need to yawn and swallow to relieve pressure 
Overview The term albinism usually refers to oculocutaneous ok u low ku TAY nee us albinism OCA 
SymptomsSymptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision 
But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown 
Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age 
Because of this, very light colored eyes may appear red in some lighting 
VisionVision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism 
Rapid, back and forth movement of the eyes that can t be controlled, called nystagmus 
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness 
Legal blindness vision less than or complete blindness 
If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider 
These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism 
Causes Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin 
Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes 
Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder 
OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems 
The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types 
Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems 
The most common form of ocular albinism is type 
This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome 
Different types of albinism have different types of inheritance patterns 
Eye complicationsProblems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive 
Skin complicationsPeople with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun 
Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism 
Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin 
Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer 
This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage 
Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it s advanced 
Social and emotional challengesSome people with albinism may experience discrimination 
These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self esteem and stress 
Alcohol intolerance Overview Alcohol intolerance can cause immediate, uncomfortable reactions after you drink alcohol 
The most common signs and symptoms are stuffy nose and skin flushing 
The only way to prevent these uncomfortable reactions is to avoid alcohol 
Simply avoid alcohol, limit how much you drink or avoid certain types of alcoholic beverages 
However, if you have a serious reaction or severe pain, see your doctor 
This is caused by inherited genetic traits most often found in Asians 
Your immune system also releases histamines during an allergic reaction 
In rare instances, an allergic reaction can be life threatening anaphylactic reaction and require emergency treatment 
PreventionUnfortunately, nothing can prevent reactions to alcohol or ingredients in alcoholic beverages 
To avoid a reaction, avoid alcohol or the particular substance that causes your reaction 
Be aware, however, that labels might not list all ingredients 
Drinking too much too quickly can affect breathing, heart rate, body temperature and gag reflex 
In some cases, this can lead to a coma and death 
If you think that someone has alcohol poisoning, get medical attention right away 
Slow breathing, which is fewer than eight breaths a minute 
This is when there is a gap of more than seconds between breaths 
A person with alcohol poisoning who has passed out or can t wake up could die 
This is true even if you don t see the usual signs 
But it s best to take action right away rather than be sorry later 
But the results of not getting help in time can be far more serious 
Causes Alcohol in the form of ethanol, also called ethyl alcohol, is in alcoholic beverages 
It s also in mouthwash, some cooking extracts, some medicines and certain household products 
Other forms of alcohol can cause toxic poisoning that requires emergency treatment 
Isopropyl alcohol, which is found in rubbing alcohol, lotions and some cleaning products 
Methanol or ethylene glycol, which is a common ingredient in antifreeze, paints and solvents 
Binge drinkingA major cause of alcohol poisoning is binge drinking 
An alcohol binge can occur over hours or last up to several days 
A person can consume a fatal dose of alcohol before passing out 
And it takes a lot more time for the body to get rid of alcohol 
Beer fluid ounces milliliters with about alcohol 
Malt liquor to fluid ounces to milliliters with about alcohol 
Wine fluid ounces milliliters with about alcohol 
Mixed drinks may contain more than one serving of alcohol 
Risk factors Several factors can increase your risk of alcohol poisoning, including 
Whether you ve had alcohol along with other drugs, including medicines you take for health reasons 
This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure and a fast heart rate 
The blood sugar level may drop low enough to cause seizures 
The body temperature may drop so low that it leads to cardiac arrest 
Alcohol poisoning can cause a heartbeat that is not regular 
Heavy drinking may cause brain damage that can t be reversed 
Some medicines can cause harmful effects when taken with even small amounts of alcohol 
Ask your health care provider if these risks apply to you 
Having some food in your stomach may slow the process of absorbing alcohol somewhat 
Talk to your teenagers about the dangers of alcohol, including binge drinking 
Use childproof bathroom and kitchen cabinets to prevent access to household cleaners 
Keep toxic items in your garage or storage area safely out of reach 
Overview Alcoholic hepatitis is swelling, called inflammation, of the liver caused by drinking alcohol 
Alcoholic hepatitis most often happens in people who drink heavily over many years 
But the link between drinking and alcoholic hepatitis isn t simple 
And some people who drink much less get the disease 
If you re diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, you must stop drinking alcohol 
People who keep drinking alcohol have a high risk of serious liver damage and death 
The yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black and brown people 
Drinking large amounts of alcohol keeps people from being hungry 
And heavy drinkers get most of their calories from alcohol 
Being confused and acting oddly due to a buildup of toxins 
The healthy liver breaks these toxins down and gets rid of them 
When to see a doctorAlcoholic hepatitis is a serious, often deadly disease 
Causes Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by damage to the liver from drinking alcohol 
These factors are known to play a role in alcoholic hepatitis 
The body s way of breaking down alcohol makes highly toxic chemicals 
These chemicals trigger swelling, called inflammation, that destroys liver cells 
Other factors that can be involved with alcoholic hepatitis include 
Many people who drink heavily don t get enough nutrients because they eat poorly 
And alcohol keeps the body from using nutrients as it should 
It isn t known how much alcohol it takes to cause alcoholic hepatitis 
This can mean glasses of wine, beers, or shots of spirits 
Women seem to have a higher risk of getting alcoholic hepatitis 
That might be because of how alcohol breaks down in women s bodies 
Heavy drinkers who are overweight might be more likely to get alcoholic hepatitis 
And they might be more likely to go on to get liver scarring 
Studies suggest that genes might be involved in alcohol induced liver disease 
Black and Hispanic people might be at higher risk of alcoholic hepatitis 
Complications Complications of alcoholic hepatitis are caused by scar tissue on the liver 
They re likely to bleed if filled with too much blood 
Fluid that builds up in the belly might get infected and need treatment with antibiotics 
But it most often means advanced alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis 
A damaged liver has trouble removing toxins from the body 
A damaged liver can affect blood flow to the kidneys 
This scarring of the liver can lead to liver failure 
PreventionYou might reduce your risk of alcoholic hepatitis if you 
The only certain way to prevent alcoholic hepatitis is to avoid all alcohol 
Protect yourself from hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by a virus 
Ask your healthcare professional if it s safe to drink alcohol when taking your prescribed medicines 
Read the warning labels on medicines you can get without a prescription 
Don t drink alcohol when taking medicines that warn against drinking alcohol while taking them 
Churg Strauss syndrome Overview Churg Strauss syndrome is a disorder marked by blood vessel inflammation 
This inflammation can restrict blood flow to organs and tissues, sometimes permanently damaging them 
Symptoms can usually be controlled with steroids and other powerful immunosuppressant drugs 
Also see your doctor if you have asthma or nasal allergies that suddenly worsen 
Churg Strauss syndrome is rare, and it s more likely that these symptoms have some other cause 
Early diagnosis and treatment improve the chances of a good outcome 
Other potential risk factors include chronic asthma or nasal problems 
Genetics and exposures to environmental allergens also may play a role 
If Churg Strauss syndrome affects your kidneys, you can develop glomerulonephritis 
Overview Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold like symptoms 
These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure 
But unlike a cold, hay fever isn t caused by a virus 
Common allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites 
But you don t have to put up with annoying symptoms 
You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment 
Mucus that runs down the back of your throat postnasal drip 
Grass pollen, which is common in late spring and summer 
Spores from indoor and outdoor fungi and molds, which can be both seasonal and year round 
Runny nose with watery or thick yellow discharge body aches low grade fever 
 to days after exposure to a cold virus 
When to see a doctorSee your health care provider if 
Allergy medications don t provide relief or cause annoying side effects 
This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever 
Risk factors The following can increase your risk of developing hay fever 
Having a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes your skin irritated and itchy 
Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma 
Being exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose 
Having a mother who smoked during your first year of life 
Complications Problems that may go along with hay fever include 
For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school 
Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep 
This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell malaise 
Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing 
In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection otitis media 
Take allergy medications before you re exposed to allergens, as directed by your health care provider 
While most allergies can t be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms 
In some severe cases, allergies can trigger a life threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis 
Itching of the nose, eyes or roof of the mouth 
A large area of swelling edema at the sting site 
Atopic dermatitis, an allergic skin condition also called eczema, can cause skin to 
A life threatening medical emergency, anaphylaxis can cause you to go into shock 
If you carry an epinephrine auto injector Auvi Q, EpiPen, others , give yourself a shot right away 
The immune system then produces antibodies that remain on the alert for that particular allergen 
Airborne allergens, such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites and mold 
Certain foods, particularly peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk 
Latex or other substances you touch, which can cause allergic skin reactions 
Risk factors You might be more likely to develop an allergy if you 
Have a family history of asthma or allergies, such as hay fever, hives or eczema 
Complications Having an allergy increases your risk of certain other medical problems, including 
If you have severe allergies, you re at increased risk of this serious allergy induced reaction 
Foods, medications and insect stings are the most common triggers of anaphylaxis 
Your risk of getting these conditions is higher if you have hay fever or asthma 
PreventionPreventing allergic reactions depends on the type of allergy you have 
Even if you re treating your allergy symptoms, try to avoid triggers 
If you re allergic to dust mites, dust and vacuum and wash bedding often 
Dust mite allergy Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Dust mites eat skin cells shed by people, and they thrive in warm, humid environments 
Medications or other treatments are sometimes necessary to relieve symptoms and manage asthma 
SymptomsDust mite allergy symptoms caused by inflammation of nasal passages include 
If your dust mite allergy contributes to asthma, you may also experience 
Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing 
A dust mite allergy can range from mild to severe 
Sometimes it s difficult to know whether you have a cold or an allergy 
If symptoms persist for longer than one week, you might have an allergy 
Risk factors The following factors increase your risk of developing a dust mite allergy 
Being exposed to high levels of dust mites, especially early in life, increases your risk 
You re more likely to develop dust mite allergy during childhood or early adulthood 
These obstructions may make you more likely to develop infections of the sinuses sinusitis 
People with asthma and dust mite allergy often have difficulty managing asthma symptoms 
Egg allergy Overview Eggs are one of the most common allergy causing foods for children 
Rarely, egg allergy can cause anaphylaxis a life threatening reaction 
Most children, but not all, outgrow their egg allergy before adolescence 
Skin inflammation or hives the most common egg allergy reaction 
Asthma signs and symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, chest tightness or shortness of breath 
The shot comes in a device that makes it easy to deliver, called an autoinjector 
If possible, see the doctor when the allergic reaction is occurring 
For egg allergy, the immune system mistakenly identifies certain egg proteins as harmful 
Risk factors Certain factors can increase the risk of developing egg allergy 
With age, the digestive system matures and allergic food reactions are less likely to occur 
The same immune system reaction that causes egg allergy can also cause other conditions 
Allergies to other foods, such as milk, soy or peanuts 
Some people react to foods with only trace amounts of egg 
Let your child s caregivers know about his or her egg allergy 
Make sure they understand what to do in an emergency 
Several terms indicate that egg products have been used in manufacturing processed foods, including 
Words starting with ova or ovo, such as ovalbumin or ovoglobulin 
Vaccinations and egg allergySome shots to prevent illness vaccines contain egg proteins 
In some people, these vaccines pose a risk of triggering an allergic reaction 
Flu influenza vaccines sometimes contain small amounts of egg proteins 
Yellow fever vaccine can provoke an allergic reaction in some people who have egg allergy 
It s given to travelers entering countries where there s a risk of contracting yellow fever 
Other vaccines are generally not risky for people who have egg allergy 
While there s no cure, some children outgrow their food allergies as they get older 
For other people, an allergic food reaction can be frightening and even life threatening 
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, and throat or other parts of the body 
AnaphylaxisIn some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis 
If possible, see a care professional when the allergic reaction is occurring 
Seek emergency treatment if you develop any symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as 
In serious cases, the reaction results in swelling of the throat or even anaphylaxis 
Symptoms are typically triggered by eating these foods when they re fresh and uncooked 
However, when these foods are cooked, symptoms may be less severe 
Some herbs and spices anise, caraway seed, coriander, fennel, parsley 
Some herbs and spices anise, black pepper, caraway seed, coriander, fennel, mustard, parsley 
Common conditions that can cause symptoms mistaken for a food allergy include 
Absence of an enzyme needed to fully digest a food 
You may not have adequate amounts of some enzymes needed to digest certain foods 
Lactose intolerance can cause bloating, cramping, diarrhea and excess gas 
Some people have digestive reactions and other symptoms after eating certain food additives 
Rather than an allergic reaction, this is known as histamine toxicity or scombroid poisoning 
Food allergies are more common in children, especially toddlers and infants 
Fortunately, children typically outgrow allergies to milk, soy, wheat and eggs 
Severe allergies and allergies to nuts and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong 
When they do, both food allergy and asthma symptoms are more likely to be severe 
Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anaphylactic reaction include 
Delaying use of epinephrine to treat your food allergy symptoms 
Food allergy may cause a skin reaction, such as eczema 
For some people, this is a mere inconvenience, but others find it a greater hardship 
This is especially true in restaurants and in other social settings 
If you know you have a food allergy, follow these steps 
If your child has a food allergy, take these precautions to ensure your child s safety 
Notify key people that your child has a food allergy 
If you have a latex allergy, your body mistakes latex for a harmful substance 
Understanding latex allergy and knowing common sources of latex can help you prevent allergic reactions 
Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure 
AnaphylaxisThe most serious allergic reaction to latex is anaphylaxis, which can be deadly 
An anaphylactic an uh fuh LAK tik reaction develops immediately after latex exposure in highly sensitive people 
You can breathe in these particles when they become airborne 
It s possible to have other skin reactions when using latex 
This reaction results from the chemical additives used during manufacturing 
Symptoms include dry, itchy, irritated areas, usually on the hands 
Products containing synthetic materials, such as latex paint, are unlikely to cause a reaction 
Risk factors Certain people are at greater risk of developing a latex allergy 
Repeated exposure to latex gloves and medical products increases your risk of developing latex allergy 
If you work in health care, you re at increased risk of developing a latex allergy 
Connection between food allergy and latex allergyCertain fruits contain the same allergens found in latex 
It s one of the most common food allergies in children 
An allergic reaction usually occurs soon after you or your child consumes milk 
Milk allergy can also cause anaphylaxis a severe, life threatening reaction 
Avoiding milk and milk products is the primary treatment for milk allergy 
Those who don t outgrow it may need to continue to avoid milk products 
Signs and symptoms that may take more time to develop include 
Tests can help confirm milk allergy, so you can avoid future and potentially worse reactions 
Signs and symptoms start soon after milk consumption and can include 
Constriction of airways, including a swollen throat that makes it difficult to breathe 
If possible, see your provider during the allergic reaction to help make a diagnosis 
Seek emergency treatment if you or your child develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis 
Causes All true food allergies are caused by an immune system malfunction 
There are two main proteins in cow s milk that can cause an allergic reaction 
Casein, found in the solid part curd of milk that curdles 
Whey, found in the liquid part of milk that remains after milk curdles 
You or your child may be allergic to only one milk protein or to both 
These proteins may be hard to avoid because they re also in some processed foods 
Although any food can be a trigger, milk is one of the most common 
Unlike some food allergies, food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome FPIES usually resolves over time 
As with milk allergy, preventing an FPIES reaction involves avoiding milk and milk products 
Risk factors Certain factors may increase the risk of developing milk allergy 
Many children who are allergic to milk also have other allergies 
Sources of milkObvious sources of allergy causing milk proteins are found in dairy products, including 
Ingredients spelled with the prefix lact such as lactose and lactate 
When in doubt, contact the manufacturer to be sure a product doesn t contain milk ingredients 
Breastfeeding is the best source of nutrition for your infant 
Depending on their level of processing, products are classified as either partially or extensively hydrolyzed 
Some hypoallergenic formulas aren t milk based, but instead contain amino acids 
Besides extensively hydrolyzed products, amino acid based formulas are the least likely to cause an allergic reaction 
Soy based formulas are based on soy protein instead of milk 
You may need to exclude from your diet all products that contain milk 
A mold allergy can cause coughing, itchy eyes and other symptoms that make you miserable 
Signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis caused by a mold allergy can include 
Mold allergy symptoms vary from person to person and range from mild to severe 
In some people, exposure to certain molds can cause a severe asthma attack 
Being allergic to one type of mold doesn t mean you ll be allergic to another 
Some of the most common molds that cause allergies include alternaria, aspergillus, cladosporium and penicillium 
Having indoor humidity higher than can increase mold in your home 
Exposure to high levels of household mold can trigger mold allergy symptoms 
Working or living in a building that s been exposed to excess moisture 
Examples include leaky pipes, water seepage during rainstorms and flood damage 
Damp areas such as bathrooms, kitchens and basements are most vulnerable 
However, certain allergic conditions caused by mold are more severe 
In people allergic to mold, breathing in spores can trigger an asthma flare up 
This results from an inflammatory reaction to fungus in the sinuses 
It can be triggered by exposure to allergy causing dust at work 
Other problems caused by moldBesides allergens, mold can pose other health risks to susceptible people 
For example, mold can cause infections of the skin or mucous membranes 
PreventionTo reduce mold growth in your home, consider these tips 
Eliminate sources of dampness in basements, such as pipe leaks or groundwater seepage 
Use a dehumidifier in any area of your home that smells musty or damp 
Remember to clean the collection bucket and condensation coils regularly 
Have forced air heating ducts inspected and, if necessary, cleaned 
If left in damp places, such as basements, they can quickly become moldy 
Nickel allergy is often associated with earrings and other jewelry 
SymptomsAn allergic reaction contact dermatitis usually begins within hours to days after exposure to nickel 
The reaction may last as long as to weeks 
If you think the area may have become infected, see your doctor right away 
Sources of nickel exposureCommon items that may expose you to nickel include 
Some extremely sensitive people may be affected by nickel containing foods 
Risk factors Certain factors may increase your risk of developing nickel allergy, including 
These people may include bartenders, people who work in certain food industries and domestic cleaners 
Females are more likely to have a nickel allergy than are males 
This may be because females tend to have more piercings 
People who have a sensitivity to other metals may also be allergic to nickel 
However, it s not always easy to avoid nickel because it s present in so many products 
Home test kits are available to check for nickel in metal items 
The following tips may help you avoid nickel exposure Wear hypoallergenic jewelryAvoid jewelry that contains nickel 
Purchase jewelry that s made of materials that aren t likely to cause allergic reactions 
Surgical grade stainless steel may contain some nickel, but it s generally considered hypoallergenic for most people 
Be sure that your earring backings also are made of hypoallergenic materials 
Use substitute materialsLook for safer substitutes for common nickel containing items 
Zippers or clothing fasteners made of plastic or coated metals 
If your hands have to touch nickel, wearing gloves may help 
Clear nail polish on jewelry may help, but may have to be reapplied often 
Overview Peanut allergy is one of the most common causes of severe allergy attacks 
There is still a risk of a more serious future reaction 
SymptomsAn allergic response to peanuts usually occurs within minutes after exposure 
Itching or tingling in or around the mouth and throat 
Digestive problems, such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting 
Swelling of the throat that makes it difficult to breathe 
Causes Peanut allergy occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies peanut proteins as something harmful 
The most common cause of peanut allergy is eating peanuts or peanut containing foods 
Sometimes direct skin contact with peanuts can trigger an allergic reaction 
This is the unintended introduction of peanuts into a product 
It s generally the result of a food being exposed to peanuts during processing or handling 
Risk factors It isn t clear why some people develop allergies while others don t 
However, people with certain risk factors have a greater chance of developing peanut allergy 
Food allergies are most common in children, especially toddlers and infants 
However, even if you seem to have outgrown peanut allergy, it may recur 
Some people with the skin condition atopic dermatitis eczema also have a food allergy 
Complications Complications of peanut allergy can include anaphylaxis 
Before introducing your baby to peanuts, discuss the best approach with your child s doctor 
Common signs and symptoms of penicillin allergy include hives, rash and itching 
Severe reactions include anaphylaxis, a life threatening condition that affects multiple body systems 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of penicillin allergy often occur within an hour after taking the drug 
Less commonly, reactions can occur hours, days or weeks later 
AnaphylaxisAnaphylaxis is a rare, life threatening allergic reaction that causes the widespread dysfunction of body systems 
Serum sickness, which may cause fever, joint pain, rash, swelling and nausea 
Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, which involves severe blistering and peeling of the skin 
Chemicals released by this activity cause the signs and symptoms associated with an allergic reaction 
Penicillins and related drugsPenicillins belong to a class of antibacterial drugs called beta lactam antibiotics 
A history of other allergies, such as food allergy or hay fever 
Increased exposure to penicillin, because of high doses, repetitive use or prolonged use 
PreventionIf you have a penicillin allergy, the simplest prevention is to avoid the drug 
Steps you can take to protect yourself include the following 
Inform other health care professionals, such as your dentist or any medical specialist 
Wear a medical alert bracelet that identifies your drug allergy 
Some people may also experience signs of asthma, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing 
Medications or other treatments may be necessary to relieve symptoms and manage asthma 
SymptomsPet allergy signs and symptoms caused by inflammation of nasal passages include 
If your pet allergy contributes to asthma, you may also experience 
This type of dermatitis is an immune system reaction that causes skin inflammation 
If symptoms persist for more than two weeks, you might have an allergy 
It also collects easily in upholstered furniture and sticks to your clothes 
Pet saliva can stick to carpets, bedding, furniture and clothing 
Rodents and rabbitsRodent pets include mice, gerbils, hamsters and guinea pigs 
Allergens from rodents are usually present in hair, dander, saliva and urine 
Being exposed to pets at an early age may help you avoid pet allergies 
AsthmaPeople with asthma and pet allergy often have difficulty managing asthma symptoms 
Marine animals in the shellfish category include crustaceans and mollusks 
Examples are shrimp, crabs, lobster, squid, oysters, scallops and snails 
If you think you have shellfish allergy, talk to your health care provider 
Tests can help confirm the allergy so you can take steps to avoid future reactions 
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body 
Coughing and choking or a tight feeling in the throat 
AnaphylaxisAllergies can cause a severe, potentially life threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis 
If anaphylaxis isn t treated right away, it can be fatal 
Shock, with a severe drop in your blood pressure and a rapid or weak pulse 
When to see a doctorSeek emergency treatment if you develop signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis 
Causes All food allergies are caused by an immune system overreaction 
Your immune system identifies a harmless substance as being harmful 
In shellfish allergy, your immune system mistakenly identifies a certain protein in shellfish as harmful 
This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of an allergic reaction 
Types of shellfishThere are several types of shellfish, each containing different proteins 
Mollusks include squid, octopus, mussels, snails, clams, oysters, abalone and scallops 
Some people are allergic to only one type of shellfish but can eat others 
Your health care provider can help you determine what is safe to eat 
Though people of any age can develop shellfish allergy, it s more common in adults 
In fact, shellfish allergy is the most common food allergy in adults 
Allergic reactions to very small amounts of shellfish extreme sensitivity 
Anaphylaxis is treated with an emergency injection of epinephrine adrenaline 
Even trace amounts of shellfish can cause a severe reaction in some people 
You may need to completely avoid places where shellfish are prepared or processed 
Some people react after touching shellfish or inhaling steam from cooking shellfish 
Wheat allergy Overview Wheat allergy is an allergic reaction to foods containing wheat 
Medications may be necessary to manage allergic reactions if you accidentally eat wheat 
Wheat allergy sometimes is confused with celiac disease, but these conditions differ 
Wheat allergy occurs when your body produces antibodies to proteins found in wheat 
AnaphylaxisFor some people, wheat allergy may cause a life threatening reaction called anaphylaxis 
In addition to other signs and symptoms of wheat allergy, anaphylaxis may cause 
Risk factors Certain factors may put you at greater risk of developing wheat allergy 
Anyone can lose hair on their head, but it s more common in men 
Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp 
Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness 
Some people prefer to let their hair loss run its course untreated and unhidden 
Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats or scarves 
SymptomsHair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what s causing it 
This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age 
In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead 
Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair 
Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out 
A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen 
This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary 
It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing 
Sudden hair loss can signal an underlying medical condition that requires treatment 
Causes People typically lose to hairs a day 
This usually isn t noticeable because new hair is growing in at the same time 
Hair loss occurs when new hair doesn t replace the hair that has fallen out 
Hair loss is typically related to one or more of the following factors 
The most common cause of hair loss is a hereditary condition that happens with aging 
This condition is called androgenic alopecia, male pattern baldness and female pattern baldness 
The hair may not grow back the same as it was before 
Hot oil hair treatments and permanents also can cause hair to fall out 
Risk factors A number of factors can increase your risk of hair loss, including 
A family history of balding on your mother s or father s side 
PreventionMost baldness is caused by genetics male pattern baldness and female pattern baldness 
These tips may help you avoid preventable types of hair loss 
Avoid harsh treatments such as hot rollers, curling irons, hot oil treatments and permanents 
Limit the tension on hair from styles that use rubber bands, barrettes and braids 
Ask your doctor about medications and supplements you take that might cause hair loss 
Protect your hair from sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light 
Some studies show an association between smoking and baldness in men 
If you re being treated with chemotherapy, ask your doctor about a cooling cap 
This cap can reduce your risk of losing hair during chemotherapy 
It makes people allergic to red meat and other products made from mammals 
The bite transfers a sugar molecule called alpha gal into the body 
The Lone Star tick is found mainly in the southeastern United States 
Most cases of alpha gal syndrome are reported in the south, east and central United States 
But the condition appears to be spreading farther north and west 
Deer are carrying the Lone Star tick to new parts of the country 
Other types of ticks carry alpha gal molecules in different parts of the world 
Some people may have alpha gal syndrome and not know it 
Tests also show that they don t have other food allergies 
Researchers think that some of these people may be affected by alpha gal syndrome 
There s no treatment other than avoiding red meat and other products made from mammals 
Wear long pants and long sleeved shirts when you re in wooded, grassy areas 
Check your whole body for ticks after you spend time outside 
In alpha gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about to hours after you are exposed 
Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products 
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts 
Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction 
See your primary care health care provider or an allergy specialist, called an allergist 
Don t rule out red meat as a possible cause of your reaction 
Bites from other types of ticks can lead to the condition too 
Tick bitesExperts think the ticks that cause alpha gal syndrome carry alpha gal molecules 
For unknown reasons, some people have a strong immune response to these molecules 
These antibodies target alpha gal as something the immune system needs to clear out 
They cannot eat any foods made from mammals without having an allergic reaction 
People who get many tick bites over time may develop worse symptoms 
Research appears to show that cases of this drug allergy are linked to alpha gal syndrome 
The condition mostly happens in the south, east and central United States 
You re at higher risk if you live or spend time in these regions and 
This tick also has been found as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma 
Alpha gal syndrome also happens in other parts of the world 
This includes parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America 
Complications Alpha gal syndrome can cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis is treated with prescription medicine called epinephrine, also known as adrenaline 
Swelling of the throat that makes it hard to breathe 
PreventionThe best way to prevent alpha gal syndrome is to avoid areas where ticks live 
You can lower your risk of getting alpha gal syndrome by following some simple tips 
Dress to protect yourself when you re in wooded or grassy areas 
Wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves 
Also try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass 
If you have a dog, keep it on a leash too 
If you re a parent, put the bug spray on your children 
Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully 
Apply products with the ingredient permethrin to clothing, or buy pre treated clothing 
Be watchful after you spend time in wooded or grassy areas 
It s helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors 
Ticks often stay on your skin for hours before they attach themselves 
Shower and use a washcloth to try to remove any ticks 
The exact cause of the disease is still not known 
Eventually ALS affects control of the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe 
ALS generally begins with muscle weakness that spreads and gets worse over time 
Weakness associated with muscle cramps and twitching in the arms, shoulders and tongue 
ALS often starts in the hands, feet, arms or legs 
There s generally no pain in the early stages of ALS 
The second group extends from the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body 
ALS causes both groups of motor neurons to gradually deteriorate and then die 
When motor neurons are damaged, they stop sending messages to the muscles 
For about of people with ALS, a genetic cause can be identified 
Most theories center on a complex interaction between genes and factors in the environment 
ALS is most common between the ages of and the mid s 
Before the age of , slightly more men than women develop ALS 
Environmental factors, such as the following, have been associated with an increased risk of ALS 
Evidence supports that smoking is an environmental risk factor for ALS 
Women who smoke seem to be at even higher risk, particularly after menopause 
It s not clear what about military service might trigger ALS 
Complications As the disease progresses, ALS causes complications, such as 
Breathing problemsOver time, ALS leads to weakness of the muscles used to breathe 
The device is similar to what someone with sleep apnea might wear 
Some people with advanced ALS choose to have a tracheostomy 
A ventilator may work better on a tracheostomy than on a mask 
The most common cause of death for people with ALS is breathing failure 
Half of people with ALS die within to months of diagnosis 
However, some people with ALS live years or longer 
Speaking problemsMost people with ALS develop weakness of the muscles used to form speech 
This usually starts with slower speech and occasional slurring of words 
This can progress to the point that others can t understand the person s speech 
Other forms of communication and technology are used to communicate 
Eating problemsPeople with ALS can develop weakness of the muscles involved with swallowing 
A feeding tube can reduce these risks and ensure proper hydration and nutrition 
DementiaSome people with ALS have problems with language and decision making 
Some are eventually diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia 
Usually a blood clot forms at the site where a tooth was removed 
Also, the clot contains cells that are needed for proper healing of the site 
Intense pain happens when the underlying bone and nerves are exposed 
Pain occurs in the socket and along the nerves to the side of the face 
It may fill with bits of food, making the pain worse 
Your dentist or oral surgeon can offer treatments to relieve your pain 
Severe pain within a few days after removing a tooth 
Loss of part or all of the blood clot at the tooth removal site 
Bad breath or a foul odor coming from your mouth 
Causes The exact cause of dry socket is still being studied 
Researchers think that certain issues may be involved, such as 
Injury at the surgical site when tooth removal is difficult 
This can happen with irregular wisdom tooth development or position, called an impacted wisdom tooth 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of developing dry socket include 
Chemicals in cigarettes or other forms of tobacco may prevent or slow healing 
Pain may last longer than usual after a tooth removal 
Dry socket also may lead to an infection in the socket 
PreventionWhat you can do before surgeryYou can take these steps to help prevent dry socket 
Look for a dentist or oral surgeon with experience in removing teeth 
Good oral care before surgery keeps your teeth and gums clean and removes bacteria 
Smoking and using other tobacco products increase your risk of dry socket 
Dressing with medicine to put on the wound after surgery 
Oral antibiotics, usually only if you have a weakened immune system 
Cold and warm packs can help decrease pain and swelling 
Avoid alcoholic, caffeinated, carbonated or hot beverages for as long as recommended 
Do not drink with a straw for at least a week 
The sucking action may cause the blood clot to come out of the socket 
Eat only soft foods, such as yogurt or applesauce, for the first day 
When you feel ready, start eating foods that do not need a lot of chewing 
Mix teaspoon milliliters of table salt in ounces milliliters of water 
Using tobacco products after oral surgery can slow healing and increase the risk of complications 
Overview Alzheimer s disease is a brain disorder that gets worse over time 
It s characterized by changes in the brain that lead to deposits of certain proteins 
Alzheimer s disease causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to eventually die 
Among them, more than are years old and older 
The early signs of the disease include forgetting recent events or conversations 
Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers 
In advanced stages, severe loss of brain function can cause dehydration, malnutrition or infection 
But memory gets worse and other symptoms develop as the disease progresses 
Brain changes associated with Alzheimer s disease lead to growing trouble with 
Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work or at home 
Misplace items, often putting them in places that don t make sense 
Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects 
Have trouble finding the right words for objects, expressing thoughts or taking part in conversations 
Doing more than one task at once is especially difficult 
It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time 
Eventually, a person with Alzheimer s disease may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers 
It may become harder for someone to respond to everyday problems 
Planning and performing familiar tasksRoutine activities that require completing steps in order become a struggle 
This may include planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game 
Causes The exact causes of Alzheimer s disease aren t fully understood 
But at a basic level, brain proteins fail to function as usual 
The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other 
In these cases, the disease usually begins in middle age 
The development of the disease begins years before the first symptoms 
The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory 
By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk significantly 
These clumps form larger deposits called amyloid plaques, which also include other cellular debris 
In Alzheimer s disease, tau proteins change shape and organize into structures called neurofibrillary tangles 
The tangles disrupt the transport system and cause damage to cells 
Risk factors AgeIncreasing age is the greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer s disease 
But as you grow older, the chances of developing it increases 
Among people ages to , there were new diagnoses per , people 
For those and older, there were new diagnoses per , people 
A better understood genetic factor is a form of the apolipoprotein E APOE gene 
A form of the gene, APOE e , increases the risk of Alzheimer s disease 
About to of the population carries APOE e 
But not everyone with this form of the gene develops the disease 
But these changes account for less than of people with Alzheimer s disease 
This is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 
But the decline doesn t prevent the person from functioning in social or work environments 
However, people with MCI have a significant risk of developing dementia 
They also can schedule regular health care appointments to monitor symptoms 
The risk is even higher in people with more severe and multiple TBIs 
Excessive alcohol consumptionDrinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes 
Therefore, changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk 
A person with Alzheimer s disease may not be able to 
As Alzheimer s disease moves into its last stages, brain changes begin to affect physical functions 
The changes can affect the ability to swallow, balance, and control bowel and bladder movements 
These effects can lead to other health problems such as 
However, a number of lifestyle risk factors can be modified 
To follow heart healthy lifestyle choices that may reduce the risk of dementia 
Follow treatment guidelines to manage high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol 
If you smoke, ask your health care professional for help to quit 
The external sex organs may not match the internal sex organs or genetic sex 
Ambiguous genitalia isn t a disease, it s a disorder of sex development 
Babies who are genetically female with two X chromosomes may have 
Closed labia, or labia that include folds and resemble a scrotum 
Babies who are genetically male with one X and one Y chromosome may have 
An abnormally small penis with the urethral opening closer to the scrotum 
The absence of one or both testicles in what appears to be the scrotum 
Male and female sex organs develop from the same tissue 
Male genitals develop in response to male hormones from the fetal testicles 
Occasionally, a chromosomal abnormality may make determination of genetic sex complex 
Mutations in certain genes can influence fetal sex development and cause ambiguous genitalia 
In some cases, the cause of ambiguous genitalia may not be determined 
Rarely, a tumor in the mother can produce male hormones 
This may be due to genetic abnormalities or unknown causes 
Possible risk factors for ambiguous genitalia include a family history of 
Infertility, absent menstrual periods or excess facial hair in females 
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a group of inherited genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands 
Whether people with ambiguous genitalia can have children depends on the specific diagnosis 
Lazy eye amblyopia Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The weaker or lazy eye often wanders inward or outward 
Amblyopia generally develops from birth up to age years 
It is the leading cause of decreased vision among children 
Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent long term problems with your child s vision 
Sometimes lazy eye is not evident without an eye exam 
For all children, a complete eye exam is recommended between ages and 
Difference in sharpness of vision between the eyes refractive amblyopia 
Glasses or contact lenses are typically used to correct these refractive problems 
In some children lazy eye is caused by a combination of strabismus and refractive problems 
Deprivation amblyopia in infancy requires urgent treatment to prevent permanent vision loss 
Risk factors Factors associated with an increased risk of lazy eye include 
Ameloblastoma begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on your teeth 
In some cases, reconstruction may be necessary to restore your teeth, jaw and facial appearance 
Causes Ameloblastoma begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on your teeth 
Ameloblastomas are generally classified by type, but they can also be classified by cell type 
This type is less aggressive, but typically occurs at a younger age 
The tumor is often in the back of the lower jawbone at the molars 
The tumor has a low risk of recurrence after treatment 
ContraceptivesSome people who take birth control pills oral contraceptives may not have periods 
MedicationsCertain medications can cause menstrual periods to stop, including some types of 
Hormonal imbalanceMany types of medical problems can cause hormonal imbalance, including 
Structural problemsProblems with the sexual organs themselves also can cause amenorrhea 
Uterine scarring prevents the normal buildup and shedding of the uterine lining 
Because the reproductive system didn t develop fully, menstrual cycles aren t possible later in life 
An obstruction of the vagina may prevent visible menstrual bleeding 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of amenorrhea include 
Complications The causes of amenorrhea can cause other problems as well 
If you don t ovulate and don t have menstrual periods, you can t become pregnant 
These two problems can be caused by not having enough estrogen 
Cardiovascular disease includes heart attack and problems with the blood vessels and heart muscle 
This parasite is found in the feces of the triatomine reduviid bug 
Rare cases of Chagas disease have also been found in the southern United States 
Left untreated, Chagas disease later can cause serious heart and digestive problems 
During the acute phase of infection, treatment of Chagas disease focuses on killing the parasite 
In people who have chronic Chagas disease, it s no longer possible to kill the parasite 
Treatment in this later phase is about managing signs and symptoms 
When signs and symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and may include 
Signs and symptoms that develop during the acute phase usually go away on their own 
In severe cases, Chagas disease signs and symptoms may include 
Symptoms may include swelling at the infection site, fever, fatigue, body aches, rash and nausea 
Infected bugs defecate after feeding, leaving behind parasites on the skin 
Scratching or rubbing the bite site helps the parasites enter your body 
Eating uncooked food contaminated with feces from bugs infected with the parasite 
Being born to a person who is infected with the parasite 
Being accidentally exposed to the parasite while working in a lab 
Spending time in a forest that contains infected wild animals, such as raccoons and opossums 
The following factors may increase your risk of getting Chagas disease 
Living in poor rural areas of Central America, South America and Mexico 
Receiving a blood transfusion or organ transplant from a person who carries the infection 
Triatomine bugs are usually found in structures built with mud or adobe or thatch 
This rare condition is caused by the abnormal widening dilation of your esophagus 
Megacolon occurs when your colon becomes abnormally dilated, causing stomach pain, swelling and severe constipation 
These types of residences are more likely to harbor triatomine bugs 
Use insecticide soaked netting over your bed when sleeping in thatch, mud or adobe houses 
Overview Amnesia refers to the loss of memories, including facts, information and experiences 
Instead, people with amnesia also called amnestic syndrome usually know who they are 
But they may have trouble learning new information and forming new memories 
Unlike a temporary episode of memory loss, called transient global amnesia, amnesia can be permanent 
There s no specific treatment for amnesia, but treatment can be directed at the underlying cause 
Most people with amnesia have problems with short term memory, so they can t retain new information 
For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents 
Isolated memory loss doesn t affect a person s intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span 
These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual spatial skills 
Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment 
Additional symptomsDepending on the cause of the amnesia, other symptoms may include 
False memories that are either completely invented or are real memories misplaced in time 
If someone you know has symptoms of amnesia, help the person get medical attention 
Causes Typical memory function involves many parts of the brain 
Any disease or injury that affects the brain can affect memory 
They include the thalamus found deep within the center of the brain 
They also include the hippocampal formations found within the temporal lobes of the brain 
Amnesia caused by brain injury or damage is known as neurological amnesia 
It also may be due to an autoimmune reaction in the absence of cancer 
Alzheimer s disease and other diseases that involve the degeneration of nerve tissue 
Certain medicines such as benzodiazepines or others that act as sedatives 
This is especially common in the early stages of recovery 
Another rare type of amnesia, called dissociative amnesia, stems from emotional shock or trauma 
It can result from being the victim of a violent crime or experiencing other trauma 
In this disorder, people may lose personal memories and information about their lives 
Risk factors The chance of developing amnesia might increase if you ve experienced 
But even mild amnesia takes a toll on daily activities and quality of life 
The syndrome can cause problems at work, at school and in social settings 
PreventionDamage to the brain can be a root cause of amnesia 
It s important to take steps to minimize your chance of a brain injury 
Wear a helmet when bicycling and a seat belt when driving 
Treat infections quickly so that they don t have a chance to spread to the brain 
Get immediate medical treatment if you have symptoms that suggest a stroke or brain aneurysm 
Transient global amnesia Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
You can t remember where you are or how you got there 
You may not remember anything about what s happening right now 
The condition most often affects people in middle or older age 
Episodes of transient global amnesia always get better slowly over a few hours 
During recovery, you may begin to remember events and circumstances 
Transient global amnesia isn t serious, but it can still be frightening 
Once that symptom is confirmed, ruling out other possible causes of amnesia is important 
You must have these signs and symptoms to be diagnosed with transient global amnesia 
Sudden onset of confusion that includes memory loss, seen by a witness 
Being awake and alert and knowing who you are, despite memory loss 
More symptoms and history that may help diagnose transient global amnesia 
Symptoms lasting no more than hours and generally shorter 
Causes The underlying cause of transient global amnesia is unknown 
There may be a link between transient global amnesia and a history of migraines 
But experts don t understand the factors that contribute to both conditions 
Being emotionally upset, perhaps by bad news, conflict or overwork 
This is probably because transient global amnesia doesn t represent blood vessel diseases of aging 
Ampullary cancer forms near many other parts of the digestive system 
When ampullary cancer grows, it may affect these other organs 
Ampullary cancer treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer 
Treatment also may include radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill cancer cells 
Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice 
Ampullary cancer happens when cells in the ampulla of Vater develop changes in their DNA 
A cell s DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do 
In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate 
The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time 
The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly 
Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die 
The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor 
The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue 
In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of ampullary cancer include 
Ampullary cancer is more common in adults older than 
This amyloid buildup can make the organs not work properly 
These types may improve with treatment of the other diseases 
Some types of amyloidosis may lead to life threatening organ failure 
Treatments may include chemotherapy with strong drugs used to treat cancer 
Other types of medications can reduce amyloid production and control symptoms 
Some people may benefit from organ or stem cell transplants 
SymptomsYou may not experience symptoms of amyloidosis until later in the course of the disease 
An enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge 
Skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and purplish patches around the eyes 
Others are caused by outside factors, such as inflammatory diseases or long term dialysis 
This is the most common type of amyloidosis in developed countries 
It s usually triggered by an inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
This inherited disorder often affects the nerves, heart and kidneys 
It most commonly happens when a protein made by your liver is abnormal 
Wild type amyloidosis tends to affect men over age and often targets the heart 
Typical sites for localized amyloidosis include the bladder, skin, throat or lungs 
Correct diagnosis is important so that treatments that affect the entire body can be avoided 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of amyloidosis include 
Most people diagnosed with amyloidosis are between ages and 
Having a chronic infectious or inflammatory disease increases the risk of AA amyloidosis 
This condition is less common with more modern dialysis techniques 
Amyloid reduces the heart s ability to fill with blood between heartbeats 
If amyloidosis affects the heart s electrical system, it can cause heart rhythm problems 
This affects their ability to remove waste products from the body 
Nerve damage can cause pain, numbness, or tingling of the fingers and feet 
Overview Anal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the anal canal 
The anal canal is a short tube at the end of rectum 
Stool passes through the anal canal as it leaves the body 
As it grows, it might cause a growth or lump 
In the past, most people with anal cancer had surgery to remove the cancer 
Often this operation involved making a new way for waste to leave the body 
Today, most anal cancer treatment involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
Causes Anal cancer happens when cells in the anal canal develop changes in their DNA 
Most anal cancers are thought to be caused by human papillomavirus, also called HPV 
HPV is a common virus that s passed through sexual contact 
Risk factors Things that may increase the risk of anal cancer include 
For most people, it causes no problems and goes away on its own 
People who have receptive anal sex have an increased risk of anal cancer 
People who smoke cigarettes have an increased risk of anal cancer 
Certain medical conditions, such as infection with HIV, also can weaken the immune system 
Complications Anal cancer rarely spreads to other parts of the body 
Only a small percentage of cancers are found to have spread 
Anal cancer that spreads most commonly goes to the liver and the lungs 
PreventionTake steps to reduce your riskThere is no sure way to prevent anal cancer 
Reduce your risk of anal cancer by taking measures to prevent sexually transmitted infections 
Ask your healthcare team if an HPV vaccine is right for you 
Healthcare professionals sometimes recommend screening for people with a high risk of anal cancer 
You might have a high risk of anal cancer if you 
Are taking medicine to control your immune system after an organ transplant 
Have been diagnosed with precancerous cells in the penis, scrotum, cervix, vagina or vulva 
During an anal Pap test, a healthcare professional swabs cells from your anal canal 
The anal HPV test involves testing cells from the anal canal for infection with HPV 
Screening can detect anal cancer when it s small and easier to treat 
But studies haven t proved that anal cancer screening can save lives 
Talk about the benefits and risks of screening with your healthcare team 
Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements 
Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age 
Some people with anal fissures may need medicine or, occasionally, surgery 
Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours 
Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement 
A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include 
Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing 
Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth 
This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract 
This may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing 
Complications Complications of an anal fissure may include 
Once you ve experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one 
An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed 
If this happens, it makes it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal 
Most anal fistulas are the result of an infection that starts in an anal gland 
Oozing of pus, blood or stool from the tunnel opening 
Pain in the rectum and anus, especially when sitting or passing stool 
Causes Most anal fistulas are caused by an infection that starts in an anal gland 
A fistula is the tunnel that forms under the skin along this drainage tract 
Fistulas are classified by their involvement of these sphincter muscles 
Risk factors Risk factors for an anal fistula include 
Anal fistulas occur more often in males than in females 
Surgical treatment may result in the inability to hold in stool fecal incontinence 
Anal itching, also called pruritus ani proo RIE tus A nie , has several possible causes 
If the symptoms don t clear up with self care, talk with your health care provider 
SymptomsSymptoms of anal itching may include intense itching, inflammation, burning and soreness 
The itching and irritation may be short lived or more persistent, depending on the cause 
Anal itching often is worse at bedtime or in hot, humid weather 
When to see a doctorMedical care isn t needed for most anal itching 
Or your skin care routine may include products or behaviors that irritate the skin 
Examples include using harsh soaps or wiping too hard and too often 
These include sexually transmitted infections, pinworm infections and yeast infections 
It can happen seconds or minutes after you ve been exposed to something you re allergic to 
Blood pressure drops suddenly, and the airways narrow, blocking your breathing 
The pulse may be fast and weak, and you may have a skin rash 
Anaphylaxis needs to be treated right away with an injection of epinephrine 
If it isn t treated right away, it can be deadly 
Signs and symptoms include a rapid, weak pulse a skin rash and nausea and vomiting 
Common triggers include certain foods, some medications, insect venom and latex 
Anaphylaxis requires an injection of epinephrine and a follow up trip to an emergency room 
If you don t have epinephrine, you need to go to an emergency room immediately 
SymptomsSymptoms of anaphylaxis include hives and itchy, pale, or flushed skin 
You may get nauseous, vomit, have diarrhea, feel dizzy, and faint 
Anaphylaxis symptoms usually occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen 
Sometimes, however, anaphylaxis can occur a half hour or longer after exposure 
Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin 
If you have an attack and you carry an epinephrine autoinjector, administer it right away 
It happens when the immune system mistakes a food or substance for something that s harmful 
In response, the immune system releases a flood of chemicals to fight against it 
These chemicals are what cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction 
Allergy symptoms usually aren t life threatening, but a severe reaction can lead to anaphylaxis 
In adults, stings from insects, latex, and some medications can cause anaphylaxis 
The immune system produces antibodies that defend against foreign substances 
This is good when a foreign substance is harmful, such as certain bacteria or viruses 
But some people s immune systems overreact to substances that don t normally cause an allergic reaction 
Allergy symptoms aren t usually life threatening, but a severe allergic reaction can lead to anaphylaxis 
Besides allergy to peanuts, nuts, fish, sesame and shellfish, anaphylaxis triggers in adults include 
Stings from bees, yellow jackets, wasps, hornets and fire ants 
Talk with your health care provider about precautions to take when exercising 
If you ve had anaphylaxis once, your risk of having this serious reaction increases 
Future reactions might be more severe than the first reaction 
People who have either condition are at increased risk of having anaphylaxis 
Keep an emergency kit with prescribed medications available at all times 
Be sure to alert all your providers to medication reactions you ve had 
If you re allergic to stinging insects, use caution around them 
Even small amounts of food you re allergic to can cause a serious reaction 
Having anemia can cause tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath 
Treatments for anemia might involve taking supplements or having medical procedures 
Eating a healthy diet might prevent some forms of anemia 
SymptomsAnemia symptoms depend on the cause and how bad the anemia is 
Anemia can be so mild that it causes no symptoms at first 
But symptoms usually then occur and get worse as the anemia gets worse 
If another disease causes the anemia, the disease can mask the anemia symptoms 
Then a test for another condition might find the anemia 
Certain types of anemia have symptoms that point to the cause 
Some people learn they have low hemoglobin when they donate blood 
If you re told that you can t donate because of low hemoglobin, make a medical appointment 
Causes Anemia occurs when the blood doesn t have enough hemoglobin or red blood cells 
The body doesn t make enough hemoglobin or red blood cells 
Bleeding causes loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin faster than they can be replaced 
The body destroys red blood cells and the hemoglobin that s in them 
What red blood cells doThe body makes three types of blood cells 
Red blood cells have an iron rich protein that gives blood its red color, called hemoglobin 
To make them, the body needs iron, vitamin B , folate and other nutrients from foods 
Causes of anemiaDifferent types of anemia have different causes 
Too little iron in the body causes this most common type of anemia 
Without enough iron, the body can t make enough hemoglobin for red blood cells 
Pregnant people can get this type of anemia if they don t take iron supplements 
This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also called pernicious anemia 
Diseases that cause ongoing inflammation can keep the body from making enough red blood cells 
Examples are cancer, HIV AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease and Crohn s disease 
This rare, life threatening anemia occurs when the body doesn t make enough new blood cells 
Diseases such as leukemia and myelofibrosis can affect how the bone marrow makes blood 
The effects of these types of diseases range from mild to life threatening 
Certain blood diseases increase how fast red blood cells are destroyed 
Some types of hemolytic anemia can be passed through families, which is called inherited 
This inherited and sometimes serious condition is a type of hemolytic anemia 
An unusual hemoglobin forces red blood cells into an unusual crescent shape, called a sickle 
Risk factors These factors can increase risk of anemia 
A diet that doesn t have enough of certain vitamins and minerals 
Not getting enough iron, vitamin B and folate increases the risk of anemia 
In general, having heavy periods can create a risk of anemia 
These conditions can lead to having too few red blood cells 
A history of certain infections, blood diseases and autoimmune conditions increases the risk of anemia 
People over age are at increased risk of anemia 
Complications If not treated, anemia can cause many health problems, such as 
Severe anemia can make it impossible to do everyday tasks 
Anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat, called arrhythmia 
This can lead to an enlarged heart or heart failure 
Some inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia, can lead to life threatening complications 
Losing a lot of blood quickly causes severe anemia and can be fatal 
But eating a healthy diet might prevent iron deficiency anemia and vitamin deficiency anemias 
Foods rich in vitamin B include meat, dairy products, and fortified cereals and soy products 
The condition leaves you fatigued and more prone to infections and uncontrolled bleeding 
A rare and serious condition, aplastic anemia can develop at any age 
It can occur suddenly, or it can come on slowly and worsen over time 
Aplastic anemia can be short lived, or it can become chronic 
Other factors that can injure bone marrow and affect blood cell production include 
Aplastic anemia can be a temporary side effect of these treatments 
Your immune system might attack your bone marrow during pregnancy 
Fanconi s anemia is a rare, inherited disease that leads to aplastic anemia 
The disease is diagnosed with the help of blood tests 
If you have mild thalassemia, you might not need treatment 
The signs and symptoms you have depend on the type and severity of your condition 
Some people who have only one affected hemoglobin gene don t have thalassemia symptoms 
The mutations associated with thalassemia are passed from parents to children 
Alpha thalassemiaFour genes are involved in making the alpha hemoglobin chain 
One mutated gene, you ll have no signs or symptoms of thalassemia 
Two mutated genes, your thalassemia signs and symptoms will be mild 
Three mutated genes, your signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe 
Inheriting four mutated genes is rare and usually results in stillbirth 
Babies born with this condition often die shortly after birth or require lifelong transfusion therapy 
Beta thalassemiaTwo genes are involved in making the beta hemoglobin chain 
Two mutated genes, your signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe 
A milder form, called thalassemia intermedia, also can result from two mutated genes 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of thalassemia include 
Thalassemia is passed from parents to children through mutated hemoglobin genes 
This is especially true if you ve had your spleen removed 
In cases of severe thalassemia, the following complications can occur 
Thalassemia can make your bone marrow expand, which causes your bones to widen 
This can result in abnormal bone structure, especially in your face and skull 
Bone marrow expansion also makes bones thin and brittle, increasing the chance of broken bones 
Thalassemia is often accompanied by the destruction of a large number of red blood cells 
This causes your spleen to enlarge and work harder than normal 
If your spleen grows too big, your doctor might suggest surgery to remove it 
Anemia can both slow a child s growth and delay puberty 
Congestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms can be associated with severe thalassemia 
Iron deficiency anemia Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron 
As a result, iron deficiency anemia may leave you tired and short of breath 
You can usually correct iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation 
SymptomsInitially, iron deficiency anemia can be so mild that it goes unnoticed 
Unusual cravings for non nutritive substances, such as ice, dirt or starch 
Poor appetite, especially in infants and children with iron deficiency anemia 
So see your doctor for a diagnosis rather than taking iron supplements on your own 
Causes Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body doesn t have enough iron to produce hemoglobin 
Gastrointestinal bleeding can result from regular use of some over the counter pain relievers, especially aspirin 
Your body regularly gets iron from the foods you eat 
If you consume too little iron, over time your body can become iron deficient 
Examples of iron rich foods include meat, eggs, leafy green vegetables and iron fortified foods 
For proper growth and development, infants and children need iron from their diets, too 
Iron from food is absorbed into your bloodstream in your small intestine 
Iron deficiency anemia may lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat 
Additionally, iron deficiency anemia is associated with an increased susceptibility to infections 
PreventionYou can reduce your risk of iron deficiency anemia by choosing iron rich foods 
Your body absorbs more iron from meat than it does from other sources 
Sickle cell anemia Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Red blood cells are usually round and flexible, so they move easily through blood vessels 
In sickle cell anemia, some red blood cells are shaped like sickles or crescent moons 
These sickle cells also become rigid and sticky, which can slow or block blood flow 
SymptomsSymptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around months of age 
They vary from person to person and may change over time 
Typical red blood cells usually live for about days before they need to be replaced 
Without enough red blood cells, the body can t get enough oxygen 
Some people have only a few pain crises a year 
Red blood cells provide the body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth 
Tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells 
Infections often start with a fever and can be life threatening 
One sided paralysis or weakness in the face, arms or legs 
Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don t have symptoms 
That means they can pass the gene to their children 
Complications Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including 
If your child has any of these signs or symptoms, seek medical treatment right away 
Sickle cells can block the blood vessels that supply blood to the bones 
When the bones don t get enough blood, joints may narrow and bones can die 
This can happen anywhere but most often happens in the hip 
People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs 
Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal 
In sickle cell anemia, blood also is low in oxygen 
Sickle cells can get trapped in the spleen, causing it to enlarge 
Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the eyes 
Sickle cell anemia can cause painful open sores on the legs 
The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin 
A high level of bilirubin in the body can lead to gallstones 
Sickle cell anemia can cause painful, long lasting erections, known as priapism 
It also can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight babies 
You also can learn about possible treatments, preventive measures and reproductive options 
Vitamin deficiency anemia Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Vitamin supplements, taken by pill or injection, can correct the deficiencies 
SymptomsVitamin deficiency anemia usually develops slowly over several months to years 
Signs and symptoms may be subtle at first but usually increase as the deficiency worsens 
Vitamin B deficienciesLow levels of vitamin B can be caused by 
Without this substance, B can t be absorbed in the intestines 
Surgical removal or bypass of a large part of the intestines 
A lack of folate can cause birth defects during pregnancy 
Risk factors Things that may increase your risk of vitamin deficiency anemia include 
Certain autoimmune diseases, including Crohn s disease, celiac disease and type diabetes 
Pernicious anemia increases the risk of stomach or intestinal cancers 
Enriched grain products, such as bread, cereal, pasta and rice 
Most adults need these daily dietary amounts of the following vitamins 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women may require more of each vitamin 
Most people get enough vitamins from the foods they eat 
The aorta carries blood from the heart to the body 
An aneurysm often looks like a berry hanging on a stem 
This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage 
But most brain aneurysms aren t serious, especially if they re small 
In many cases, brain aneurysms are found during tests for other conditions 
However, a ruptured aneurysm quickly becomes life threatening and requires medical treatment right away 
If a brain aneurysm hasn t ruptured, treatment may be appropriate in some cases 
Treatment of an unruptured brain aneurysm may prevent a rupture in the future 
This type of aneurysm looks like a berry hanging from a vine 
It usually forms on arteries at the base of the brain 
A berry aneurysm is the most common type of aneurysm 
This type of aneurysm causes bulging on all sides of the artery 
When an infection affects the arteries in the brain, it can weaken the artery wall 
Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions 
However, a ruptured aneurysm is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache 
Ruptured aneurysmA sudden, severe headache is the key symptom of a ruptured aneurysm 
This headache is often described by people as the worst headache they ve ever experienced 
In addition to a severe headache, symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include 
 Leaking aneurysmIn some cases, an aneurysm may leak a slight amount of blood 
A sudden, extremely severe headache that may last several days and up to two weeks 
Unruptured aneurysmAn unruptured brain aneurysm may not have any symptoms, especially if it s small 
However, a larger unruptured aneurysm may press on brain tissues and nerves 
When to see a doctorSeek immediate medical attention if you develop a 
Risk factors Several factors can contribute to weakness in an artery wall 
These factors may increase the risk of a brain aneurysm or aneurysm rupture 
But some conditions present at birth can increase the risk of developing a brain aneurysm 
However, they re more common in adults between ages and 
Brain aneurysms are more common in women than in men 
Aneurysms are more likely to form and to rupture in weakened arteries 
If illicit drugs are used intravenously, it can lead to an infection 
This inherited disorder results in fluid filled sacs in the kidneys 
In this condition, arteries and veins in the brain are tangled 
Your risk is higher if you have family members who have had a brain aneurysm 
Some types of aneurysms may occur after a head injury or from certain blood infections 
Complications When a brain aneurysm ruptures, the bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds 
However, the blood can cause direct damage to surrounding cells and can kill brain cells 
Complications that can develop after the rupture of an aneurysm include 
An aneurysm that has ruptured or has leaked is at risk of bleeding again 
After a brain aneurysm ruptures, blood vessels in the brain may contract and narrow 
Vasospasm can cause an ischemic stroke, in which there s limited blood flow to brain cells 
A buildup of fluid within the brain, known as hydrocephalus 
The blood can block the movement of fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord 
Bleeding in the brain can disrupt the balance of sodium in the blood 
But there are some changes you can make to lower your risk 
Also work with your health care provider to lower your blood pressure if it s high 
Don t drink large amounts of alcohol or use drugs such as cocaine 
Causes An aneurysm is a ballooning in a weak spot in an artery wall 
Many different things can cause the popliteal artery wall to become weak, including 
Wear and tear of the popliteal artery due to repeat use of the knee joint 
Popliteal artery aneurysm often occurs in men with abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA 
Anyone diagnosed with popliteal artery aneurysm should be screened for AAA 
Complications Complications of popliteal artery aneurysm include blood clots 
Blood clots can cause a severe lack of blood flow in the lower leg 
A severe lack of blood flow can cause the following symptoms 
A severe lack of blood flow may result in loss of the limb 
But the risk of popliteal artery aneurysm rupture is low 
Following a heart healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart disease and blood vessel damage 
When the aortic wall is weak, the artery may widen 
When the vessel is significantly widened, it s called an aneurysm 
A thoracic aortic aneurysm also is called a thoracic aneurysm 
Treatment of a thoracic aortic aneurysm may vary from regular health checkups to emergency surgery 
There are usually no symptoms, making them difficult to detect 
How quickly a thoracic aortic aneurysm may grow is difficult to predict 
Symptoms that a thoracic aortic aneurysm has ruptured or dissected include 
Sharp, sudden pain in the upper back that spreads downward 
An aortic dissection or aneurysm rupture is a medical emergency 
Call or your local emergency number for immediate help 
Causes Aortic aneurysms can develop anywhere in the body s main artery, called the aorta 
The aorta runs from the heart through the chest and belly area 
When an aneurysm occurs in the chest, it s called a thoracic aortic aneurysm 
Plaque buildup on the artery walls causes the arteries to become less flexible 
Additional pressure can cause the arteries to weaken and widen 
High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase the risk of atherosclerosis 
Aortic aneurysms in younger people often have a genetic cause 
The aortic valve is between the lower left heart chamber and the aorta 
Aortic emergenciesIn aortic dissection, a tear occurs in the wall of the aorta 
It s important to treat an aortic aneurysm to try to prevent dissection 
If dissection occurs, people can still be treated with surgery 
Thoracic aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age and older 
Smoking and using tobacco greatly increases the risk of an aortic aneurysm 
The risk also is increased for an aortic or other blood vessel dissection or rupture 
In general, the larger the aneurysm, the greater the risk of rupture 
Complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm and rupture can include 
Small blood clots can develop in the area of the aortic aneurysm 
PreventionKeeping the blood vessels as healthy as possible is important in preventing an aneurysm 
Proper management of such conditions may lower the risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm complications 
Screening and genetic testingConditions that cause a thoracic aortic aneurysm may run in families 
Screening means you have regular imaging tests, usually an echocardiogram, to check for an aneurysm 
A ruptured aneurysm causes bleeding inside the body and often leads to death 
You might not know you have an aneurysm even if it is large 
Aneurysms can develop in several parts of the body, including 
The part of the aorta that passes through the belly area abdominal aortic aneurysm 
The part of the aorta that passes through the chest thoracic aortic aneurysm 
Blood vessels that send blood to the brain brain aneurysm 
To determine the risk of an aneurysm rupture, a health care provider considers 
Treatment of some aneurysms may only involve regular health checkups and imaging tests 
If an aneurysm breaks open, emergency open surgery is needed 
Sometimes a less invasive treatment called endovascular surgery may be done 
Angelman syndrome causes delayed development, problems with speech and balance, mental disability, and, sometimes, seizures 
Delays in maturing, called developmental delays, begin between about and months of age 
The delays often are the first signs of Angelman syndrome 
Seizures may begin between the ages of and years old 
People with Angelman syndrome tend to live close to a typical life span 
Developmental delays, including no crawling or babbling at to months 
Seizures, often beginning between and years of age 
Odd behaviors, such as hand flapping and arms uplifted while walking 
When to see a doctorMost babies with Angelman syndrome don t show symptoms at birth 
The first signs of Angelman syndrome most often are developmental delays 
This includes lack of crawling or babbling between and months 
Causes Angelman syndrome is caused by changes in a gene, called a genetic change 
A missing or damaged geneYou receive your pairs of genes from your parents 
One copy comes from your mother, called the maternal copy 
The other comes from your father, called the paternal copy 
Most often, the maternal copy of the UBE A gene helps the brain develop 
Angelman syndrome happens when part of the maternal copy is missing or damaged 
Researchers often don t know what causes the genetic changes that result in the disease 
Most people with Angelman syndrome don t have a family history 
But sometimes Angelman syndrome may be passed down from a parent 
A family history of the disease may increase a baby s risk of getting Angelman syndrome 
Trouble sucking and swallowing together may cause feeding problems in infants 
Your child s healthcare professional may suggest a high calorie formula to help your baby gain weight 
People with Angelman syndrome often have changes in their sleep wake patterns 
Some people with Angelman syndrome get a side to side spinal curve over time 
Your healthcare professional or a genetic counselor can help you plan future pregnancies 
If blood flow is restricted, it can result in organ and tissue damage 
There are many types of vasculitis, and most of them are rare 
Vasculitis can affect anyone, though some types are more common among certain age groups 
Depending on the type you have, you may improve without treatment 
Most types require medications to control the inflammation and prevent flare ups 
SymptomsGeneral signs and symptoms of most types of vasculitis include 
Other signs and symptoms are related to the parts of the body affected, including 
If your stomach or intestines are affected, you may experience pain after eating 
Ulcers and perforations are possible and may result in blood in the stool 
Dizziness, ringing in the ears and abrupt hearing loss may occur 
Vasculitis can make your eyes look red and itch or burn 
Some types of vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in a hand or foot 
The palms of the hands and soles of the feet might swell or harden 
Bleeding under the skin can show up as red spots 
Vasculitis can also cause lumps or open sores on your skin 
Others result from the immune system attacking blood vessel cells by mistake 
Immune system diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and scleroderma 
Factors that may increase the risk of certain disorders include 
Behcet s disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Kawasaki disease sometimes run in families 
Vasculitis can sometimes be triggered by medications such as hydralazine, allopurinol, minocycline and propylthiouracil 
Having hepatitis B or C can increase your risk of vasculitis 
Complications Vasculitis complications depend on the type and severity of your condition 
Some types of vasculitis can be severe, causing damage to major organs 
A blood clot may form in a blood vessel, obstructing blood flow 
Rarely, vasculitis will cause a blood vessel to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm AN yoo riz um 
This is a possible complication of untreated giant cell arteritis 
Some of the medications used to treat vasculitis may weaken your immune system 
Angina pain is often described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest 
It may feel like a heavy weight lying on the chest 
If you have unexplained chest pain, seek medical help right away 
The type depends on the cause and whether rest or medication relieve symptoms 
It usually happens during activity exertion and goes away with rest or angina medication 
Stable angina pain is predictable and usually similar to previous episodes of chest pain 
The chest pain typically lasts a short time, perhaps five minutes or less 
Or the angina pain is worsening and occurs with less physical effort 
It s typically severe and lasts longer than stable angina, maybe minutes or longer 
The pain doesn t go away with rest or the usual angina medications 
Variant angina, also called Prinzmetal angina, isn t due to coronary artery disease 
It s caused by a spasm in the heart s arteries that temporarily reduces blood flow 
Severe chest pain is the main symptom of variant angina 
It most often occurs in cycles, typically at rest and overnight 
Angina episodes are frequent despite a combination of medications and lifestyle changes 
Pain may also be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back 
Angina in womenSymptoms of angina in women can be different from the classic angina symptoms 
Only drive yourself to the hospital if there is no other transportation option 
Causes Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle 
Blood carries oxygen, which the heart muscle needs to survive 
When the heart muscle isn t getting enough oxygen, it causes a condition called ischemia 
The heart coronary arteries can become narrowed by fatty deposits called plaques 
This can suddenly and severely decrease blood flow to the heart muscle 
But when the demand for oxygen goes up, such as when exercising, angina can result 
Risk factors The following things may increase the risk of angina 
Angina is most common in adults age and older 
Over time, high blood pressure damages arteries by accelerating hardening of the arteries 
A high LDL increases the risk of angina and heart attacks 
A high level of triglycerides in the blood also is unhealthy 
An inactive lifestyle contributes to high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type diabetes and obesity 
Obesity is a risk factor for heart disease, which can cause angina 
Being overweight makes the heart work harder to supply blood to the body 
Surges of hormones produced during stress can narrow the arteries and worsen angina 
Drugs that tighten blood vessels, such as some migraine drugs, may trigger Prinzmetal s angina 
Cocaine and other stimulants can cause blood vessel spasms and trigger angina 
If you have any of these symptoms, seek emergency medical attention immediately 
Hives can be triggered by many situations and substances, including certain foods and medications 
It causes swelling in the deeper layers of skin, often around the face and lips 
Hives that last longer than six weeks are called chronic hives 
Skin colored, reddish on white skin, or purplish on black and brown skin 
As small as a pea or as large as a dinner plate 
Most hives appear quickly and go away within hours 
AngioedemaAngioedema is a reaction similar to hives that affects deeper layers of the skin 
See your health care provider if your symptoms continue for more than a few days 
Shellfish, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, eggs and milk are frequent offenders 
Other causes of acute hives and angioedema are insect bites and infections 
You may be at increased risk of hives and angioedema if you 
Have a family history of hives, angioedema or hereditary angioedema 
PreventionTo lower your likelihood of experiencing hives or angioedema, take the following precautions 
If you know what has triggered your hives, try to avoid that substance 
Multicentric Castleman disease, or MCD, affects multiple lymph nodes throughout the body 
This type is associated with another condition called POEMS syndrome 
Treatment and outlook vary, depending on the type of Castleman disease you have 
SymptomsMany people with unicentric Castleman disease don t notice any signs or symptoms 
Risk factors Castleman disease can affect people of any age 
But the average age of people diagnosed with unicentric Castleman disease is 
Most people with the multicentric form are in their s and s 
The multicentric form is also slightly more common in men than in women 
Multicentric Castleman disease may lead to life threatening infections or organ failure 
This type of cancer can occur any place in the body 
But it most often occurs in the skin on the head and neck 
Or it may form in deeper tissue, such as the liver and the heart 
Angiosarcoma can occur in areas that were treated with radiation therapy in the past 
SymptomsAngiosarcoma signs and symptoms may vary based on where the cancer occurs 
A raised area of skin that looks like a bruise 
Researchers have identified factors that may increase the risk of the disease 
A cell s DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do 
The changes, which doctors call mutations, tell the cells to multiply quickly 
The changes cause the cells to keep living when healthy cells would die 
The cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue 
In time, cancer cells may break away and spread to other areas of the body 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of angiosarcoma include 
Treatment with radiation for cancer or other conditions may increase the risk of angiosarcoma 
Swelling caused by a backup of lymph fluid is called lymphedema 
It happens when the lymphatic system gets blocked or damaged 
Lymphedema can happen when lymph nodes are removed during surgery 
Lymphedema can also happen when there is an infection or other conditions 
Broken ankle Overview A broken or fractured ankle is an injury to the bone 
Fractures can range from tiny cracks in your bones to breaks that pierce your skin 
Also, see a doctor if the injury interferes with walking 
The crushing injuries common in car accidents may cause breaks that require surgical repair 
Risk factors You may be at higher risk of a broken ankle if you 
Improper training techniques, such as not warming up and stretching, also can cause ankle injuries 
Studies also show that healing after a fracture may take longer in people who smoke 
Complications Complications of a broken ankle are uncommon but may include 
Fractures that extend into the joint can cause arthritis years later 
It causes pain, swelling and sometimes disability in affected muscles of the legs 
Trauma to the ankle can injure nerves and blood vessels, sometimes actually tearing them 
Seek immediate attention if you notice any numbness or circulation problems 
Lack of blood flow can cause a bone to die and collapse 
PreventionThese basic sports and safety tips may help prevent a broken ankle 
If you re a runner, replace your sneakers every to miles 
That applies to a new fitness program and each individual workout 
Get enough calcium and vitamin D Calcium rich foods include milk, yogurt and cheese 
Ask your doctor if you need to take vitamin D supplements 
Keeping clutter off the floor can help you to avoid trips and falls 
A sprained ankle occurs when the ligaments are forced beyond their normal range of motion 
Most sprained ankles involve injuries to the ligaments on the outer side of the ankle 
Treatment for a sprained ankle depends on the severity of the injury 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of a sprained ankle vary depending on the severity of the injury 
Pain, especially when you bear weight on the affected foot 
Another person stepping or landing on your foot during a sports activity 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of a sprained ankle include 
PreventionThe following tips can help you prevent a sprained ankle or a recurring sprain 
Be careful when walking, running or working on an uneven surface 
Use an ankle support brace or tape on a weak or previously injured ankle 
Wear shoes that fit well and are made for your activity 
Don t play sports or participate in activities for which you are not conditioned 
Someone who has tongue tie might have difficulty sticking out his or her tongue 
Tongue tie can also affect the way a child eats, speaks and swallows 
Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction 
Trouble sticking out the tongue past the lower front teeth 
A tongue that appears notched or heart shaped when stuck out 
Your baby has signs of tongue tie that cause problems, such as having trouble breast feeding 
A speech language pathologist thinks your child s speech is affected by tongue tie 
Causes Typically, the lingual frenulum separates before birth, allowing the tongue free range of motion 
With tongue tie, the lingual frenulum remains attached to the bottom of the tongue 
Risk factors Although tongue tie can affect anyone, it s more common in boys than girls 
Ultimately, poor breast feeding can lead to inadequate nutrition and failure to thrive 
This can contribute to tooth decay and inflammation of the gums gingivitis 
This fusing makes the spine less flexible and can result in a hunched posture 
If ribs are affected, it can be difficult to breathe deeply 
Inflammation also can occur in other parts of the body most commonly, the eyes 
Over time, symptoms might worsen, improve or stop at irregular intervals 
The joint between the base of the spine and the pelvis 
Causes Ankylosing spondylitis has no known specific cause, though genetic factors seem to be involved 
However, only some people with the gene develop the condition 
Risk factors Onset generally occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood 
Most people who have ankylosing spondylitis have the HLA B gene 
But many people who have this gene never develop ankylosing spondylitis 
This new bone gradually bridges the gap between vertebrae and eventually fuses sections of vertebrae 
Fusion also can stiffen the rib cage, restricting lung capacity and function 
See your health care provider right away if you develop these symptoms 
Some people s bones weaken during the early stages of ankylosing spondylitis 
Weakened vertebrae can crumple, increasing the severity of a stooped posture 
Ankylosing spondylitis can cause problems with the aorta, the largest artery in the body 
The inflammation associated with ankylosing spondylitis increases the risk of heart disease in general 
They may also try to lose weight by exercising excessively 
No matter how much weight is lost, the person continues to fear weight gain 
It s an extremely unhealthy and sometimes life threatening way to try to cope with emotional problems 
When you have anorexia, you often equate thinness with self worth 
SymptomsThe physical signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa are related to starvation 
Also, people with anorexia often disguise their thinness, eating habits or physical problems 
Extreme weight loss or not making expected developmental weight gains 
Eroded teeth and calluses on the knuckles from induced vomiting 
Some people who have anorexia binge and purge, similar to individuals who have bulimia 
Emotional and behavioral symptomsBehavioral symptoms of anorexia may include attempts to lose weight by 
Preoccupation with food, which sometimes includes cooking elaborate meals for others but not eating them 
Eating only a few certain safe foods, usually those low in fat and calories 
Adopting rigid meal or eating rituals, such as spitting food out after chewing 
Fear of gaining weight that may include repeated weighing or measuring the body 
Complaining about being fat or having parts of the body that are fat 
When to see a doctorUnfortunately, many people with anorexia don t want treatment, at least initially 
Their desire to remain thin overrides concerns about their health 
As with many diseases, it s probably a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors 
Peer pressure may help fuel the desire to be thin, particularly among young girls 
Risk factors Anorexia is more common in girls and women 
However, boys and men have increasingly developed eating disorders, possibly related to growing social pressures 
Changes in specific genes may put certain people at higher risk of anorexia 
Dieting is a risk factor for developing an eating disorder 
Death may occur suddenly even when someone is not severely underweight 
Heart problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure 
Electrolyte abnormalities, such as low blood potassium, sodium and chloride 
This damage may not be fully reversible, even when the anorexia is under control 
Among all women, the frequency and intensity of orgasms vary 
Also, for any individual, orgasms can be different from one time to the next 
The type and amount of stimulation needed to have an orgasm also varies 
These include relationship or intimacy issues, cultural factors, physical or medical conditions, and medicines 
Female orgasmic disorder is another term for the spectrum of problems with orgasms 
SymptomsAn orgasm is a peak feeling of intense pleasure in response to stimulating sexual activity 
Generalized, if you have problems with orgasm in any situation 
Women who don t always reach orgasm during sexual encounters may not find it distressing 
In that case, the lack of an orgasm is not considered a disorder 
Difficulties in any of these areas can affect your ability to have an orgasm 
Stressors, such as financial problems or loss of a loved one 
Relationship factorsProblems with your sex partner may be contributing factors to problems with orgasms 
Partner s sexual dysfunction, such a male partner with erectile dysfunction 
Physical causesA wide range of illnesses, physical changes and medications can interfere with orgasms 
Alcohol suppresses the nervous system and may hamper the ability to have an orgasm 
Related sexual disordersWomen experiencing anorgasmia may have one or more related sexual problems 
These may contribute to or complicate the problem with having orgasms 
Risk factors Risk factors linked to having trouble with orgasm include 
For a mild or moderate prolapse, nonsurgical treatment is often effective 
SymptomsIn mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms 
A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina 
Increased pelvic pressure when you strain, cough, bear down or lift 
When to see a doctorA prolapsed bladder can be uncomfortable, but it is rarely painful 
It can make emptying your bladder difficult, which may lead to bladder infections 
Some women are born with weaker connective tissues, making them more susceptible to anterior prolapse 
Women who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of anterior prolapse 
Humans can become infected through direct or indirect contact with sick animals 
Usually, anthrax bacteria enter the body through a wound in the skin 
You can also become infected by eating contaminated meat or inhaling the spores 
Inhaled anthrax is more difficult to treat and can be fatal 
SymptomsThere are four common routes of anthrax infection, each with different signs and symptoms 
In most cases, symptoms develop within six days of exposure to the bacteria 
However, it s possible for inhalation anthrax symptoms to take more than six weeks to appear 
It s by far the most common route of the disease 
Gastrointestinal anthraxA gastrointestinal anthrax infection results from eating undercooked meat from an infected animal 
It can affect your gastrointestinal tract from your throat to your colon 
Severe, bloody diarrhea in the later stages of the disease 
Inhalation anthraxInhalation anthrax develops when you breathe in anthrax spores 
It s the most deadly form of the disease, and is often fatal, even with treatment 
Shock an acute medical condition involving collapse of the circulatory system 
Redness at the area of injection without an area that changes to black 
When to see a doctorMany common illnesses start with symptoms that resemble the flu 
The spores can remain dormant for years until they find their way into a host 
Heroin sold in Europe likely comes from areas where naturally occurring anthrax is more common 
Risk factors To contract anthrax, you must come in direct contact with anthrax spores 
Handle animal skins, furs or wool from areas with a high incidence of anthrax 
Work in veterinary medicine, especially if you deal with livestock 
In some cases, treatment with monoclonal antibodies raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab 
Anthrax vaccineAn anthrax vaccine is available for certain groups of people 
The vaccine doesn t contain live bacteria and can t lead to infection 
Pseudomembranous colitis is sometimes called antibiotic associated colitis or C difficile colitis 
C difficile infections are more common in people over years old 
Other causesOther medicines besides antibiotics can sometimes cause pseudomembranous colitis 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of pseudomembranous colitis include 
Having a colon disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer 
However, even with prompt diagnosis and treatment, pseudomembranous colitis can be life threatening 
Severe diarrhea can lead to a significant loss of fluids and electrolytes 
An enlarged or ruptured colon requires emergency surgery and may be fatal 
In addition, pseudomembranous colitis may sometimes return, days or even weeks after apparently successful treatment 
Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed for viral illnesses that aren t helped by these drugs 
Most often, antibiotic associated diarrhea is mild and requires no treatment 
The diarrhea typically clears up within a few days after you stop taking the antibiotic 
SymptomsFor most people, antibiotic associated diarrhea causes mild signs and symptoms, such as 
Antibiotic associated diarrhea is likely to begin about a week after you start taking an antibiotic 
In addition to causing loose stools and more frequent bowel movements, C difficile infection can cause 
The antibiotics most likely to cause diarrheaNearly all antibiotics can cause antibiotic associated diarrhea 
C difficile bacteria create toxins that attack the lining of the intestine 
Risk factors Antibiotic associated diarrhea can occur in anyone who takes an antibiotic 
But you re more likely to develop antibiotic associated diarrhea if you 
Tell your doctor if you ve had antibiotic associated diarrhea or C difficile before 
Your doctor may be able to select a different antibiotic for you 
These antibodies can cause blood clots to form in arteries and veins 
The clots can lead to a heart attack, strokes and other conditions 
During pregnancy, antiphospholipid syndrome also can result in miscarriage and stillbirth 
Some people who have the syndrome have no signs or symptoms 
Signs of a deep vein thrombosis DVT include pain, swelling and redness 
Other complications of pregnancy include dangerously high blood pressure preeclampsia and premature delivery 
Some people develop a red rash with a lacy, net like pattern 
Bleeding into the skin will appear as patches of small red spots 
Seek emergency care if you have signs and symptoms of 
You may have difficulty speaking or understanding speech, visual disturbances and a severe headache 
Signs and symptoms of DVTs include swelling, redness, or pain in a leg or arm 
Antibodies usually protect the body against invaders, such as viruses and bacteria 
Antiphospholipid syndrome can be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder 
You can also develop the syndrome without an underlying cause 
Risk factors Antiphospholipid syndrome is more common in women than in men 
Having another autoimmune condition, such as lupus, increases the risk of antiphospholipid syndrome 
It s possible to have the antibodies associated with antiphospholipid syndrome without developing signs or symptoms 
However, having these antibodies increases your risk of developing blood clots, particularly if you 
This can result from decreased blood flow to your kidneys 
This can result in chronic swelling and discoloration in your lower legs 
These can include high blood pressure in your lungs and pulmonary embolism 
People with antisocial personality disorder often violate the law, becoming criminals 
They may lie, behave violently or impulsively, and have problems with drug and alcohol use 
They have difficulty consistently meeting responsibilities related to family, work or school 
Using charm or wit to manipulate others for personal gain or pleasure 
Doing dangerous things with no regard for the safety of self or others 
Being irresponsible and failing to fulfill work or financial responsibilities 
Symptoms of conduct disorder include serious, ongoing behavior problems, such as 
Causes Personality is the combination of thoughts, emotions and behaviors that makes everyone unique 
It s likely shaped by inherited genes as well as life situations and experiences 
The exact cause of antisocial personality disorder isn t known, but 
Changes in the way the brain functions may have resulted during brain development 
Family history of antisocial personality disorder or other personality disorders or mental health conditions 
Men are at greater risk of having antisocial personality disorder than women are 
Complications Complications and problems resulting from antisocial personality disorder may include 
Having other mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety 
PreventionThere s no sure way to prevent antisocial personality disorder from developing in those at risk 
It s possible to develop generalized anxiety disorder as a child or an adult 
Living with generalized anxiety disorder can be a long term challenge 
In many cases, it occurs along with other anxiety or mood disorders 
In most cases, generalized anxiety disorder improves with psychotherapy or medications 
Making lifestyle changes, learning coping skills and using relaxation techniques also can help 
Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren t 
Inability to set aside or let go of a worry 
Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge 
Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind goes blank 
Worries can shift from one concern to another and may change with time and age 
You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors seek emergency treatment immediately 
The following factors may increase the risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder 
Chronic medical illnesses or other mental health disorders may increase risk 
Impair your ability to perform tasks quickly and efficiently because you have trouble concentrating 
Generalized anxiety disorder can also lead to or worsen other physical health conditions, such as 
Digestive or bowel problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome or ulcers 
Some mental health disorders that commonly occur with generalized anxiety disorder include 
Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait 
You can reduce anxiety by carefully managing your time and energy 
Alcohol and drug use and even nicotine or caffeine use can cause or worsen anxiety 
If you re addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious 
Overview It s normal to feel nervous in some social situations 
In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life 
Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities 
Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences 
Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing 
Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant 
Fear of situations in which you may be judged negatively 
Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment 
Avoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention 
Analysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation 
Expectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation 
Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include 
Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including 
Risk factors Several factors can increase the risk of developing social anxiety disorder, including 
Complications Left untreated, social anxiety disorder can control your life 
Anxieties can interfere with work, school, relationships or enjoyment of life 
Make sure that you spend time doing things you enjoy 
Alcohol and drug use and even caffeine or nicotine use can cause or worsen anxiety 
Overview Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life 
You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings 
Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood 
Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment 
Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry 
It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression 
Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control 
You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem 
See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse 
Medical causesFor some people, anxiety may be linked to an underlying health issue 
In some cases, anxiety signs and symptoms are the first indicators of a medical illness 
Examples of medical problems that can be linked to anxiety include 
Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and asthma 
Sometimes anxiety can be a side effect of certain medications 
It s possible that your anxiety may be due to an underlying medical condition if 
You don t avoid certain things or situations because of anxiety 
Risk factors These factors may increase your risk of developing an anxiety disorder 
Adults who experience a traumatic event also can develop anxiety disorders 
People with certain personality types are more prone to anxiety disorders than others are 
People with other mental health disorders, such as depression, often also have an anxiety disorder 
Drug or alcohol use or misuse or withdrawal can cause or worsen anxiety 
Complications Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry 
It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and physical conditions, such as 
Depression which often occurs with an anxiety disorder or other mental health disorders 
Participate in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself 
Enjoy social interaction and caring relationships, which can lessen your worries 
Overview The aorta is the largest artery in the body 
It moves oxygen rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body 
It forces the heart to pump harder to move blood through the aorta 
Coarctation of the aorta is generally present at birth congenital heart defect 
Coarctation of the aorta often occurs along with other congenital heart defects 
Treatment is usually successful, but the condition requires careful lifelong follow up 
SymptomsCoarctation of the aorta symptoms depend on how much of the aorta is narrowed 
Babies with severe coarctation of the aorta may show symptoms shortly after birth 
Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta after infancy commonly include 
Coarctation of the aorta often occurs with other heart defects 
Other symptoms depend on the type of congenital heart defect 
If you or your child has sudden, unexplained chest pain, seek emergency medical care 
Causes The cause of coarctation of the aorta is unclear 
The condition is generally a heart problem present at birth congenital heart defect 
Conditions or events that can narrow the aorta and cause this condition include 
That blood vessel connects the left pulmonary artery to the aorta 
As a result, blood pressure rises in the left ventricle 
The wall of the left ventricle may become thick hypertrophy 
Risk factors Coarctation of the aorta is more common in males than in females 
A bicuspid aortic valve has two flaps cusps instead of the usual three 
Many people with coarctation of the aorta have a bicuspid aortic valve 
If it remains open, the opening is called a patent ductus arteriosus 
Holes in the wall between the left and right sides of the heart 
The mitral valve is between the upper and lower left heart chambers 
It lets blood flow through the left side of the heart 
In mitral valve stenosis, the valve is narrowed, reducing blood flow 
Without treatment, coarctation of the aorta in babies may lead to heart failure or death 
Long term chronic high blood pressure is the most common complication of coarctation of the aorta 
A weakened or bulging artery in the brain brain aneurysm 
Premature narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the heart coronary artery disease 
It may lead to kidney failure or other organ failure 
Complications are also possible after treatment for coarctation of the aorta 
People with coarctation of the aorta need regular health checkups for life 
PreventionThere s no known way to prevent coarctation of the aorta 
Also tell your provider if you have a family history of congenital heart disease 
If the blood goes through the outside aortic wall, aortic dissection is often deadly 
It usually occurs in men in their s and s 
Weak pulse in one arm or thigh compared with the other 
Causes An aortic dissection is caused by a weakened area of the aorta s wall 
Certain genetic diseases increase the risk of having an aortic dissection, including 
High blood pressure, heart problems and other health conditions may result from this disorder 
Inflammation of the arteries giant cell arteritis may also increase your risk of aortic dissection 
Men are more likely to have aortic dissection than women 
Aortic dissection is more likely in people age and older 
Infrequently, aortic dissections occur in otherwise healthy women during pregnancy 
Organ damage, such as kidney failure or life threatening intestinal damage 
Aortic valve damage aortic regurgitation or rupture into the lining around the heart cardiac tamponade 
Follow a low salt diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains and exercise regularly 
This reduces the risk of chest injury during a car accident 
Overview Aortic valve disease is a type of heart valve disease 
The aortic valve helps keep blood flowing in the correct direction through the heart 
Each heart valve has flaps of tissue that open and close once per heartbeat 
Sometimes the aortic valve flaps become thick and stiff, or they connect together 
Sometimes aortic valve disease occurs later in life due to other health conditions 
Treatment for aortic valve disease depends on the type and severity of disease 
Some people may need surgery to repair or replace the aortic valve 
SymptomsSome people with aortic valve disease may not notice symptoms for many years 
Fatigue after activity or having less ability to be active 
Shortness of breath, particularly during vigorous activity or when lying down 
This is mainly seen in children with aortic valve stenosis 
Sometimes the first symptoms of aortic valve disease are related to heart failure 
Other causes of aortic valve disease later in life include 
The heart has four valves that keep blood flowing in the correct direction 
The lower left heart chamber is called the left ventricle 
The valve may become thick and stiff or the valve may not close properly 
Risk factors Many things can raise the risk of aortic valve disease, including 
Heart valve problems present at birth, called congenital heart defects 
Some people are born with a missing, extra or fused valve flap 
This complication of strep throat can cause aortic stenosis, a type of heart valve disease 
If you have heart valve disease due to rheumatic fever, it s called rheumatic heart disease 
Inflammation of the lining of the heart s chambers and valves, called endocarditis 
Proper diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the risk of complications 
Aortic valve regurgitation can develop suddenly or over many years 
Once the condition becomes severe, surgery often is needed to repair or replace the valve 
Usually, this is due to an infection of the valve 
Tiredness and weakness, especially when being more active than usual 
Pain, discomfort or tightness in the chest, which often gets worse during exercise 
Sometimes the first symptoms of aortic valve regurgitation are related to heart failure 
Make an appointment with your health care team if you have 
Tiredness, also called fatigue, that doesn t get better with rest 
At first, the larger left ventricle helps maintain good blood flow with more force 
Any condition that damages the aortic valve can cause aortic valve regurgitation 
Others are born with connected cusps rather than the typical three separate ones 
Sometimes the valve may have only one cusp, called a unicuspid valve 
Other times, there are four cusps, called a quadricuspid valve 
Having a parent or sibling with a bicuspid valve raises your risk of the condition 
Calcium deposits can build up on the aortic valve as you age 
The buildup causes the aortic valve to stiffen and become narrow 
Aortic stenosis also may prevent the valve from closing properly 
Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart s chambers and valves 
This condition was once a common childhood illness in the United States 
Other rare conditions can cause the aorta to get bigger and damage the aortic valve 
Some immune system conditions, such as lupus, also can lead to aortic valve regurgitation 
A traumatic chest injury may damage the aorta and cause aortic regurgitation 
So might a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, called an aortic dissection 
Risk factors Things that raise the risk of aortic valve regurgitation include 
Heart problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects 
Certain conditions passed down through families that can affect the heart, such as Marfan syndrome 
Other types of heart valve disease, such as aortic valve stenosis 
The condition also can happen without any known risk factors 
Complications Complications of aortic valve regurgitation can include 
PreventionIf you have any type of heart disease, get regular health checkups 
Early diagnosis of heart valve disease, such as aortic valve regurgitation, is important 
Also, take steps to prevent conditions that can raise the risk of aortic valve regurgitation 
Get a health checkup if you have a severe sore throat 
Strep throat is treated with medicines that fight bacteria, called antibiotics 
Have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 
Treatment of aortic stenosis depends on the severity of the condition 
You may need surgery to repair or replace the valve 
Without treatment, severe aortic valve stenosis can lead to death 
Symptoms generally occur when narrowing of the valve is severe 
Some people with aortic valve stenosis may not have symptoms for many years 
An irregular heart sound heart murmur heard through a stethoscope 
Not eating enough mainly in children with aortic valve stenosis 
Not gaining enough weight mainly in children with aortic valve stenosis 
Heart failure symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and swollen ankles and feet 
The heart has four valves that keep blood flowing in the correct direction 
Each valve has flaps cusps or leaflets that open and close once during each heartbeat 
If a valve doesn t fully open or close, blood flow is reduced or blocked 
The extra work of the heart can cause the left ventricle to thicken and enlarge 
Rarely, an aortic valve may have one unicuspid or four quadricuspid cusps 
Having a congenital heart defect such as a bicuspid aortic valve requires regular medical checkups 
The valve condition may not cause any problems until adulthood 
This complication of untreated strep throat can damage the heart valves 
It may cause scar tissue to form on the aortic valve 
Rheumatic fever may damage more than one heart valve, and in more than one way 
Risk factors Risk factors of aortic valve stenosis include 
Certain heart conditions present at birth congenital heart defects , such as a bicuspid aortic valve 
Having heart disease risk factors, such as diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure 
History of infections that can affect the heart, such as rheumatic fever and infective endocarditis 
See your health care provider when you have a sore throat 
Rheumatic fever is more common in children and young adults 
They include high blood pressure, obesity and high cholesterol levels 
These risk factors may be linked to aortic valve stenosis 
There may be a link between infected gums gingivitis and infected heart tissue endocarditis 
Inflammation of heart tissue caused by infection can narrow arteries and worsen aortic valve stenosis 
APD is also sometimes called central auditory processing disorder CAPD 
But it most often happens in children and older adults 
But these conditions are different from auditory processing disorder, although they can appear with APD 
APD also can happen with other types of hearing loss 
Understanding words that are spoken quickly or in a noisy room 
Take longer to reply to someone who is talking to you 
Causes The cause of auditory processing disorder APD is sometimes unknown 
In older adults, conditions might include stroke and head trauma 
But with auditory processing disorder APD , the auditory part of the brain can t do this 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of auditory processing disorder APD include 
Aphasia Overview Aphasia is a disorder that affects how you communicate 
Aphasia usually happens suddenly after a stroke or a head injury 
Family members often participate in the process, helping the person communicate 
Substitute one word for another or one sound for another 
Patterns of aphasiaPeople with aphasia may have different strengths and weaknesses in their speech patterns 
Sometimes these patterns are labeled as different types of aphasia, including 
These patterns describe how well the person can understand what others say 
When that happens, the aphasia may be labeled with one of these names 
Many people with aphasia have patterns of speech difficulty that don t match these types 
Primary progressive aphasia is the term used for language difficulty that develops gradually 
This is due to the gradual degeneration of brain cells located in the language networks 
Sometimes this type of aphasia will progress to a more generalized dementia 
These can be due to migraines, seizures or a transient ischemic attack TIA 
Difficulty expressing wants and needs can result in embarrassment, frustration, isolation and depression 
People who have it can have trouble expressing their thoughts and understanding or finding words 
People with primary progressive aphasia can lose the ability to speak and write 
Eventually they re not able to understand written or spoken language 
These areas include brain tissue involved in speech and language 
This includes making errors in speech sounds, known as apraxia of speech 
This includes making errors in speech sound or having trouble saying words quickly 
Offer to go with the person to see a health care provider 
In this case, the frontal, temporal or parietal lobes are affected 
Atrophy is associated with the presence of certain proteins in the brain 
Risk factors Risk factors for primary progressive aphasia include 
Rare gene changes have been linked to primary progressive aphasia 
Complications People with primary progressive aphasia eventually lose the ability to speak and write 
Some people develop other symptoms such as problems with movement, balance and swallowing 
With these complications, people with the disease eventually will need help with day to day care 
People with primary progressive aphasia also can develop depression as the disease progresses 
They can be painful, however, and can make eating and talking difficult 
Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two 
There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores 
Are usually round with defined borders, but may have irregular edges when very large 
May take up to six weeks to heal and can leave extensive scarring 
Recurring sores, with new ones developing before old ones heal, or frequent outbreaks 
Food sensitivities, particularly to chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, cheese, and spicy or acidic foods 
A diet lacking in vitamin B , zinc, folate folic acid or iron 
Canker sores may also occur because of certain conditions and diseases, such as 
Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis 
Behcet s disease, a rare disorder that causes inflammation throughout the body, including the mouth 
Unlike cold sores, canker sores are not associated with herpes virus infections 
Often people with recurrent canker sores have a family history of the disorder 
Try to avoid foods that seem to irritate your mouth 
To help prevent nutritional deficiencies, eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery 
But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed 
The rest of the heart continues to work as usual 
Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart syndrome 
SymptomsSymptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic those of a heart attack 
When to see a doctorAny continued chest pain could be due to a heart attack 
Call or your local emergency number if you have new or unexplained chest pain 
Also call if you have a very rapid or irregular heartbeat or shortness of breath 
Causes The exact cause of broken heart syndrome is unclear 
An intense physical or emotional event often comes before broken heart syndrome 
Anything that causes a strong emotional reaction may trigger the condition 
Rarely, use of certain medicines or illegal drugs may lead to broken heart syndrome 
Emergency medicines used to treat severe allergic reactions or severe asthma attacks 
In broken heart syndrome, the heart arteries are not blocked 
But blood flow in the arteries of the heart may be reduced 
Risk factors Risk factors for broken heart syndrome include 
Broken heart syndrome is more common in women than in men 
Most people who have broken heart syndrome are older than 
These medicines block the potentially harmful effects of stress hormones on the heart 
Having chronic stress may increase the risk of broken heart syndrome 
However, in most people, pain begins around the belly button and then moves 
As inflammation worsens, appendicitis pain typically increases and eventually becomes serious 
Treatment of appendicitis is usually antibiotics and surgery to remove the appendix 
Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower abdomen 
Sudden pain that begins around the navel and often shifts to the lower right abdomen 
Pain that worsens with coughing, walking or making other jarring movements 
Causes A blockage in the lining of the appendix is the likely cause of appendicitis 
If not treated right away, the appendix can break open 
If your appendix bursts, you may develop a pocket of infection, called an abscess 
Once the infection is clear, you ll have surgery to remove the appendix 
In some people, the abscess is drained, and the appendix is removed immediately 
Overview Viral hemorrhagic hem uh RAJ ik fevers are infectious diseases that can cause severe, life threatening illness 
The resulting internal bleeding is usually not life threatening, but the diseases can be 
Until additional vaccines are developed, the best approach is prevention 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fevers vary by disease 
Bleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from the mouth, eyes or ears 
Causes Viral hemorrhagic fevers are spread by contact with infected animals or insects 
Most commonly the hosts include mosquitoes, ticks, rodents or bats 
Some viral hemorrhagic fevers can also be spread from person to person 
How is it transmitted Some viral hemorrhagic fevers are spread by mosquito or tick bites 
Others are spread by contact with infected body fluids, such as blood, saliva or semen 
A few varieties can be inhaled from infected rat feces or urine 
Precautions also include careful handling, disinfection and disposal of lab specimens and waste 
Get vaccinatedThe yellow fever vaccine is generally considered safe and effective 
There s also an Ebola vaccination that protects against one type of Ebola 
Wear light colored long pants and long sleeved shirts or, better yet, permethrin coated clothing 
If you re staying in tented camps or in hotels, use bed nets and mosquito coils 
Store trash in rodent proof containers, and clean the containers often 
Keep woodpiles, stacks of bricks and other materials at least feet from your house 
Mow your grass closely and keep brush trimmed to within feet of your house 
If you think you or your child has broken an arm, seek prompt medical attention 
It s important to treat a fracture as soon as possible for proper healing 
Treatment depends on the site and severity of the injury 
A simple break might be treated with a sling, ice and rest 
However, the bone may require realignment reduction in the emergency room 
SymptomsA snap or cracking sound might be your first indication you ve broken an arm 
Inability to turn your arm from palm up to palm down or vice versa 
Direct blows and injuries on the field or court cause all types of arm fractures 
In children, a broken arm might be the result of child abuse 
This type of break is known as a pathological fracture 
Complications The prognosis for most arm fractures is very good if treated early 
Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis there years later 
Seek immediate medical attention if you notice numbness or circulation problems 
Remove home hazards that can cause you to trip, such as area rugs 
Install grab bars in your bathroom and handrails on your stairways, if necessary 
Wear wrist guards for high risk activities, such as in line skating, snowboarding, rugby and football 
Smoking can increase your risk of a broken arm by reducing bone mass 
It occurs when part of the skull is misshapen or smaller than is typical 
The skull presses on the brain and forces it downward 
The type also depends on whether there are developmental changes of the brain or spine 
Chiari malformation type develops as the skull and brain are growing 
The pediatric forms of Chiari malformation are type and type 
These types are present at birth, which is known as congenital 
Treatment of Chiari malformation depends on the type and the symptoms 
SymptomsMany people with Chiari malformation have no symptoms and don t need treatment 
They learn they have Chiari malformation only when tests are performed for unrelated conditions 
These types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 
This includes central sleep apnea, which is when a person stops breathing during sleep 
Symptoms can include those related to a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele 
In myelomeningocele, the backbone and the spinal canal don t close properly before birth 
Chiari malformation type is usually noted with ultrasound during pregnancy 
It also may be diagnosed after birth or in early infancy 
Chiari malformation type Chiari malformation type is the most serious type of the condition 
This form of Chiari malformation is diagnosed at birth or during pregnancy with an ultrasound 
Many symptoms of Chiari malformation also can be caused by other conditions 
This part of the skull contains the area of the brain called the cerebellum 
Cerebrospinal fluid can build up in the brain or spinal cord 
Or it can cause signals transmitted from the brain to the body to be blocked 
Risk factors There s evidence that Chiari malformation runs in some families 
However, research into a possible hereditary component is still in its early phase 
Complications In some people, Chiari malformation may have no symptoms and they don t need treatment 
In others, Chiari malformation gets worse over time and leads to serious complications 
Hydrocephalus occurs when too much fluid builds up in the brain 
People with hydrocephalus may need a flexible tube called a shunt placed 
The shunt diverts and drains excess cerebrospinal fluid to a different area of the body 
Part of the spinal cord is exposed, which can cause serious conditions such as paralysis 
People with Chiari malformation type usually have a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele 
Some people with Chiari malformation also develop a condition called syringomyelia 
This can cause serious nerve and muscle damage in the lower body 
A heart arrhythmia may feel like a fluttering, pounding or racing heartbeat 
There are times when it is OK to have a fast or slow heartbeat 
For example, the heart may beat faster with exercise or slow down during sleep 
Heart arrhythmia treatment may include medicines, devices such as pacemakers, or a procedure or surgery 
A heart healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias 
TypesIn general, heart arrhythmias are grouped by the speed of the heart rate 
The heart rate is greater than beats a minute 
The heart rate is less than beats a minute 
AFib may be temporary and start and stop on its own 
Atrial flutter is similar to AFib, but the heartbeats are more organized 
Supraventricular tachycardia causes episodes of a pounding heartbeat that start and stop suddenly 
Most people with ventricular fibrillation have an underlying heart disease or had a serious injury 
The rapid heart rate doesn t let the ventricles properly fill with blood 
So the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body 
Ventricular tachycardia may not cause serious problems in people with otherwise healthy hearts 
Slow heartbeat, called bradycardiaA heart rate below beats a minute is considered bradycardia 
But a low resting heart rate doesn t always mean there s a problem 
If they come from the bottom chamber, they are called premature ventricular contractions PVCs 
A premature heartbeat may feel like your heart skipped a beat 
Occasionally, having very frequent premature ventricular beats may lead to a weak heart 
The irregular heartbeat may be noticed during a health checkup for another reason 
You may be told to see a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist 
Get emergency medical care if you have these heart symptoms 
A type of arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure 
This can cause the person to fall to the ground within seconds, also called collapse 
Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that needs immediate medical help 
If there s no one nearby trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR , provide hands only CPR 
Push hard and fast on the center of the chest 
Do to compressions a minute until medical help arrives 
You do not need to breathe into the person s mouth 
An AED is a device that delivers a shock to restart the heart 
If an AED is available nearby, have someone get the device and follow the instructions 
How does the heart beat The typical heart has four chambers 
The movement of the signals causes the heart to squeeze and pump blood 
But some things can change how electrical signals travel through the heart and cause arrhythmias 
A heart attack or scarring from a previous heart attack 
Some medicines, including those used to treat colds and allergies 
Risk factors Things that may increase the risk of heart arrhythmias include 
Coronary artery disease, other heart problems and previous heart surgery 
This condition increases the risk of developing coronary artery disease 
Having an overactive or underactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats 
It can lead to a slow heartbeat and irregular heartbeats, including atrial fibrillation 
Substances in the blood called electrolytes help trigger and send electrical signals in the heart 
Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold treatments can cause arrhythmias 
Drinking too much alcohol can affect electrical signaling in the heart 
Illegal drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine, may greatly affect the heart 
Complications Complications depend on the type of heart arrhythmia 
PreventionLifestyle changes used to manage heart disease may help prevent heart arrhythmias 
The plaque can cause arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow 
The plaque can also burst, leading to a blood clot 
The clot may break apart and can trigger a heart attack or stroke 
Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected 
Causes Atherosclerosis is a slowly worsening disease that may begin as early as childhood 
It may start with damage or injury to the inner layer of an artery 
High triglycerides, a type of fat lipid in the blood 
Plaque can cause the arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow 
Risk factors Hardening of the arteries occurs over time 
Other things that may increase the risk of atherosclerosis include 
High levels of C reactive protein CRP , a marker of inflammation 
Complications The complications of atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are narrowed or blocked 
When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your brain, you may develop carotid artery disease 
This can cause a transient ischemic attack TIA or stroke 
Atherosclerosis can also cause aneurysms, a serious complication that can occur anywhere in the body 
If an aneurysm bursts, it can cause life threatening bleeding inside the body 
Atherosclerosis can cause the arteries leading to the kidneys to narrow 
Narrowing of these arteries prevents enough oxygen rich blood from reaching the kidneys 
The kidneys need enough blood flow to help filter waste products and remove excess fluids 
PreventionThe same healthy lifestyle changes recommended to treat atherosclerosis also help prevent it 
Nutrients and oxygen in the blood travel from the capillaries to tissues in the body 
When this happens, tissues below the avoided capillaries receive less blood 
Arteriovenous fistulas usually occur in the legs but can develop anywhere in the body 
Symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas depend on where they form in the body 
A large untreated arteriovenous fistula can lead to serious complications 
Treatment for arteriovenous fistulas includes monitoring, compression, catheter based procedures and, sometimes, surgery 
Small arteriovenous fistulas usually don t need treatment other than monitoring by a health care provider 
Purplish, bulging veins seen through the skin, similar to varicose veins 
Pale gray or blue lips or fingernails due to lack of blood flow cyanosis 
Fingertips to spread out and become rounder than normal clubbing 
An arteriovenous fistula in the digestive tract can cause gastrointestinal GI bleeding 
Early detection of an arteriovenous fistula may make the condition easier to treat 
It may also reduce the risk of developing complications, including blood clots or heart failure 
In some babies, the arteries and veins don t develop properly in the womb 
One such disease is Osler Weber Rendu disease, also known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 
Risk factors Certain genetic or congenital conditions increase the risk of arteriovenous fistulas 
Cardiac catheterization, especially if the procedure involves blood vessels in the groin 
Certain medications, including some blood thinners anticoagulants and medications used to control bleeding antifibrinolytics 
This is the most serious complication of large arteriovenous fistulas 
Blood flows more quickly through an arteriovenous fistula than it does through typical blood vessels 
Over time, the strain on the heart can lead to heart failure 
An arteriovenous fistula in the legs can cause blood clots to form 
Leg blood clots may lead to a condition called deep vein thrombosis DVT 
Depending on where the fistula is, it may lead to a stroke 
An arteriovenous fistula can block blood flow to muscles, causing leg pain 
Arteriovenous fistulas may cause bleeding in the stomach and intestines 
Arteries move oxygen rich blood from the heart to the brain and other organs 
Veins drain the oxygen depleted blood back to the lungs and heart 
When an AVM disrupts this critical process, the surrounding tissues might not get enough oxygen 
SymptomsSymptoms of an AVM vary based on where it s found 
Children and teens might have trouble with learning or behavior 
A vein of Galen defect is situated deep inside the brain 
A buildup of fluid in the brain that causes enlargement of the head 
Risk factors Rarely, having a family history of AVMs can increase your risk 
These include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which is also called Osler Weber Rendu syndrome 
Complications The most common complications of an AVM are bleeding and seizures 
If left untreated, the bleeding can cause significant neurological damage and may be fatal 
Overview Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of your arteries 
Most often, it affects the arteries in your head, especially those in your temples 
For this reason, giant cell arteritis is sometimes called temporal arteritis 
Giant cell arteritis frequently causes headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw pain and vision problems 
You ll likely begin to feel better within days of starting treatment 
Head pain can progressively worsen, come and go, or subside temporarily 
Jaw pain when you chew or open your mouth wide 
Vision loss or double vision, particularly in people who also have jaw pain 
About percent of people with giant cell arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica 
Causes With giant cell arteritis, the lining of arteries becomes inflamed, causing them to swell 
These are just in front of your ears and continue up into your scalp 
Certain genes and environmental factors might increase your susceptibility to the condition 
Risk factors Several factors can increase your risk of developing giant cell arteritis, including 
Giant cell arteritis affects adults only, and rarely those under 
Women are about two times more likely to develop the condition than men are 
Having polymyalgia rheumatica puts you at increased risk of developing giant cell arteritis 
If you don t have symptoms, you may not need treatment 
Even with treatment, relapses are common, and your symptoms may come and go 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms of Takayasu s arteritis often occur in two stages 
Stage In the first stage, you re likely to feel unwell with 
It s possible for inflammation to damage arteries for years before you realize something is wrong 
Early detection of Takayasu s arteritis is key to getting effective treatment 
Over time the inflammation causes changes in these arteries, including thickening, narrowing and scarring 
No one knows exactly what causes the initial inflammation in Takayasu s arteritis 
The disease may be triggered by a virus or other infection 
Risk factors Takayasu s arteritis primarily affects girls and women younger than 
The disorder occurs worldwide, but it s most common in Asia 
High blood pressure, usually as a result of decreased blood flow to your kidneys 
Inflammation of the heart, which may affect the heart muscle or the heart valves 
Transient ischemic attack TIA , which is also called a ministroke 
Heart attack, which may occur as a result of reduced blood flow to the heart 
PregnancyA healthy pregnancy is possible for women with Takayasu s arteritis 
But the disease and drugs used to treat it can affect your fertility and pregnancy 
Overview Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more joints 
The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age 
The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis 
Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis 
The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life 
SymptomsThe most common signs and symptoms of arthritis involve the joints 
Depending on the type of arthritis, signs and symptoms may include 
The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint 
Risk factors Risk factors for arthritis include 
Carrying excess pounds puts stress on joints, particularly your knees, hips and spine 
People with obesity have a higher risk of developing arthritis 
Arthritis of weight bearing joints can keep you from walking comfortably or sitting up straight 
In some cases, joints may gradually lose their alignment and shape 
SymptomsPain is the first and most common symptom of thumb arthritis 
Swelling, stiffness and tenderness at the base of your thumb 
Enlarged or bony appearance of the joint at the base of your thumb 
Previous trauma or injury to the thumb joint also can cause thumb arthritis 
The bones then rub against each other, resulting in friction and joint damage 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of thumb arthritis include 
Certain hereditary conditions, such as joint ligament laxity and malformed joints 
Injuries to your thumb joint, such as fractures and sprains 
Diseases that change the normal structure and function of cartilage, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
Activities and jobs that put high stress on the thumb joint 
Osteoarthritis Overview Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide 
Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be managed, although the damage to joints can t be reversed 
Joint stiffness might be most noticeable upon awakening or after being inactive 
Your joint might feel tender when you apply light pressure to or near it 
You might not be able to move your joint through its full range of motion 
This might be caused by soft tissue inflammation around the joint 
Cartilage is a firm, slippery tissue that enables nearly frictionless joint motion 
Eventually, if the cartilage wears down completely, bone will rub on bone 
Osteoarthritis has often been referred to as a wear and tear disease 
But besides the breakdown of cartilage, osteoarthritis affects the entire joint 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of osteoarthritis include 
Women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis, though it isn t clear why 
Increased weight adds stress to weight bearing joints, such as your hips and knees 
Also, fat tissue produces proteins that can cause harmful inflammation in and around your joints 
Some people are born with malformed joints or defective cartilage 
These include diabetes and a condition in which your body has too much iron hemochromatosis 
Complications Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that worsens over time, often resulting in chronic pain 
Joint pain and stiffness can become severe enough to make daily tasks difficult 
Depression and sleep disturbances can result from the pain and disability of osteoarthritis 
Overview Gout is a common and complex form of arthritis that can affect anyone 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms of gout almost always occur suddenly, and often at night 
Gout usually affects the big toe, but it can occur in any joint 
Other commonly affected joints include the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers 
Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints 
The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red 
As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally 
Gout that goes untreated can lead to worsening pain and joint damage 
Urate crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid in your blood 
Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine 
Factors that increase the uric acid level in your body include 
Alcohol consumption, especially of beer, also increases the risk of gout 
After menopause, however, women s uric acid levels approach those of men 
Experiencing recent surgery or trauma can sometimes trigger a gout attack 
In some people, receiving a vaccination can trigger a gout flare 
Complications People with gout can develop more severe conditions, such as 
Some people may never experience gout signs and symptoms again 
Medications may help prevent gout attacks in people with recurrent gout 
If left untreated, gout can cause erosion and destruction of a joint 
Tophi usually aren t painful, but they can become swollen and tender during gout attacks 
Urate crystals may collect in the urinary tracts of people with gout, causing kidney stones 
Infants and older adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis 
People who have artificial joints are also at risk of septic arthritis 
Treatment involves draining the joint with a needle or during surgery 
SymptomsSeptic arthritis typically causes extreme discomfort and difficulty using the affected joint 
The joint could be swollen, red and warm, and you might have a fever 
Causes Septic arthritis can be caused by bacterial, viral or fungal infections 
Bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus staph is the most common cause 
The lining of your joints has little ability to protect itself from infection 
Risk factors Risk factors for septic arthritis include 
Skin that breaks easily and heals poorly can give bacteria access to your body 
People with a weak immune system are at greater risk of septic arthritis 
Complications If treatment is delayed, septic arthritis can lead to joint degeneration and permanent damage 
If septic arthritis affects an artificial joint, complications may include joint loosening or dislocation 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause persistent joint pain, swelling and stiffness 
Treatment focuses on controlling pain and inflammation, improving function, and preventing damage 
SymptomsThe most common signs and symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are 
Risk factors Some forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are more common in girls 
Complications Several serious complications can result from juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
If this condition is left untreated, it may result in cataracts, glaucoma and even blindness 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can interfere with your child s growth and bone development 
Some medications used for treatment, mainly corticosteroids, also can inhibit growth 
Most people develop psoriasis years before being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis 
Joint pain, stiffness and swelling are the main signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis 
In both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, disease flares can alternate with periods of remission 
Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and preventing joint damage 
SymptomsBoth psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are chronic diseases that worsen over time 
However, you might have periods when your symptoms improve or go away temporarily 
Psoriatic arthritis can affect joints on one or both sides of your body 
The signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis often resemble those of rheumatoid arthritis 
Both diseases cause joints to become painful, swollen and warm to the touch 
Psoriatic arthritis can cause a painful, sausage like swelling of your fingers and toes 
Some people develop a condition called spondylitis as a result of psoriatic arthritis 
Nails can form tiny dents pits , crumble or separate from the nail beds 
Psoriatic arthritis can severely damage your joints if left untreated 
Causes Psoriatic arthritis occurs when your body s immune system attacks healthy cells and tissue 
The immune response causes inflammation in your joints as well as overproduction of skin cells 
Many people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of either psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis 
Researchers have discovered certain genetic markers that appear to be associated with psoriatic arthritis 
Risk factors Several factors can increase your risk of psoriatic arthritis, including 
Having psoriasis is the single greatest risk factor for developing psoriatic arthritis 
Many people with psoriatic arthritis have a parent or a sibling with the disease 
For most people, signs and symptoms come and go, eventually disappearing within months 
Pain may also occur in the heels, low back or buttocks 
Many people who have reactive arthritis also develop eye inflammation conjunctivitis 
Inflammation of tendons and ligaments where they attach to bone enthesitis 
This happens most often in the heels and the sole of the feet 
In some cases, toes or fingers might become so swollen that they look like sausages 
The pain tends to be worse at night or in the morning 
However, the bacteria that cause it can be transmitted sexually or in contaminated food 
Only a few of the people who are exposed to these bacteria develop reactive arthritis 
Risk factors Certain factors increase your risk of reactive arthritis 
Reactive arthritis occurs most frequently in adults between the ages of and 
Women and men are equally likely to develop reactive arthritis in response to foodborne infections 
A specific genetic marker has been linked to reactive arthritis 
But most people who have this marker never develop the condition 
PreventionGenetic factors appear to play a role in whether you re likely to develop reactive arthritis 
Store your food at proper temperatures and cook it properly 
Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity 
In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body 
Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go 
Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place 
Normally, your immune system helps protect your body from infection and disease 
In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your joints 
It can also cause medical problems with your heart, lungs, nerves, eyes and skin 
Doctors don t know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include 
Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis 
Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age 
Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity 
These firm bumps of tissue most commonly form around pressure points, such as the elbows 
However, these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the heart and lungs 
Protect yourself with vaccinations to prevent diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, shingles and COVID 
Asbestosis Overview Asbestosis as bes TOE sis is a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers 
Prolonged exposure to these fibers can cause lung tissue scarring and shortness of breath 
Asbestos is a natural mineral product that s resistant to heat and corrosion 
Getting asbestosis is extremely unlikely if you follow your employer s safety procedures 
Only trained and accredited asbestos professionals should manage asbestos products 
Dry and crackling sounds in your lungs when you inhale 
Fingertips and toes that appear wider and rounder than usual clubbing 
The asbestos fibers irritate and scar lung tissue, causing the lungs to become stiff 
As asbestosis progresses, more and more lung tissue becomes scarred 
Eventually, your lung tissue becomes so stiff that it can t contract and expand normally 
Workers removing asbestos insulation around steam pipes in older buildings 
The greater the exposure is, the greater the risk is of lung damage 
PreventionReducing exposure to asbestos is the best prevention against asbestosis 
Generally, there s no risk of exposure as long as the asbestos is enclosed and undisturbed 
Always have asbestos products inspected and repaired or removed by trained and accredited asbestos professionals 
Ascariasis Overview Ascariasis as kuh RIE uh sis is a type of roundworm infection 
Adult worms, which reproduce, can be more than a foot centimeters long 
But heavy infestation can lead to serious symptoms and complications 
SymptomsMost people infected with ascariasis have no signs or symptoms 
At this stage, you may experience signs and symptoms similar to asthma or pneumonia, including 
In mild or moderate ascariasis, the intestinal infestation can cause 
If you have a large number of worms in the intestine, you might have 
People can also get it from eating uncooked pig or chicken liver that is infected 
Unwashed fruits or vegetables grown in contaminated soil also can transmit the ascariasis eggs 
The tiny microscopic ascariasis eggs can t become infective without coming into contact with soil 
Once they re back in the intestines, the parasites grow into male or female worms 
Ascariasis worms can live inside your body for a year or two 
Risk factors Risk factors for ascariasis include 
Most people who have ascariasis are years old or younger 
In the United States, ascariasis is more common in the Southeast 
But it s more frequent in developing countries with warm temperatures year round 
If you have a heavy infestation, potentially dangerous complications may include 
In heavy ascariasis infestation, a mass of worms can block a portion of your intestine 
PreventionThe best defense against ascariasis is good hygiene and common sense 
Before handling food, always wash your hands with soap and water 
Use only bottled water, and avoid raw vegetables unless you can peel and wash them 
Overview An atrial septal defect ASD is a heart condition that you re born with 
People with an ASD have a hole between the upper heart chambers 
The hole increases the amount of blood going through the lungs 
Small atrial septal defects might be found by chance and never cause a concern 
A large, long term atrial septal defect can damage the heart and lungs 
Surgery may be needed to repair an atrial septal defect and to prevent complications 
It occurs in the middle of the wall between the upper heart chambers 
It might occur with other heart problems present at birth 
It most often happens in the upper part of the wall between the heart chambers 
It often occurs with other heart structure changes present at birth 
The coronary sinus is part of the vein system of the heart 
SymptomsA baby born with an atrial septal defect ASD may not have symptoms 
Skipped heartbeats or feelings of a quick, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations 
Get immediate emergency help if a child has trouble breathing 
Causes The cause of atrial septal defect is not clear 
It happens as the baby s heart is forming during pregnancy 
The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs 
The blood then goes out to the rest of the body 
Without treatment, the right side of the heart grows larger over time and becomes weak 
The blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs also can increase, causing pulmonary hypertension 
German measles, also called rubella, during the first few months of pregnancy 
Use of some medicines during pregnancy, including those to treat seizures and mood conditions 
Complications A small atrial septal defect might never cause any concern 
High blood pressure in the lung arteries, called pulmonary hypertension 
This complication, called Eisenmenger syndrome, most often occurs over many years 
It sometimes happens in people with large atrial septal defects 
Treatment can prevent or help manage many of these complications 
A healthcare professional may suggest repairing the hole in the heart before getting pregnant 
A large atrial septal defect or its complications can lead to a high risk pregnancy 
It s important to closely control diabetes, lupus and other health conditions during pregnancy 
Your healthcare professional may suggest changing doses of some medicines or stopping them before pregnancy 
Ask about getting tested to see if you ve had German measles, also called rubella 
If you haven t already had German measles or the vaccine, get the recommended vaccinations 
Avascular necrosis osteonecrosis Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
As the condition worsens, affected joints might hurt only when putting weight on them 
Eventually, you might feel the pain even when you re lying down 
Besides the hip, the shoulder, knee, hand and foot can be affected 
When to see a doctorSee your health care provider for ongoing pain in any joint 
Seek immediate medical attention for a possible broken bone or dislocated joint 
Causes Avascular necrosis occurs when blood flow to a bone is interrupted or reduced 
An injury, such as a dislocated joint, might damage nearby blood vessels 
Cancer treatments involving radiation also can weaken bone and harm blood vessels 
Sometimes the cause of avascular necrosis not brought on by trauma isn t fully understood 
Genetics combined with overuse of alcohol, certain medications and other diseases likely play a role 
Risk factors Risk factors for developing avascular necrosis include 
Use of high dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, is a common cause of avascular necrosis 
Organ transplants, especially kidney transplants, also are associated with avascular necrosis 
Decompression sickness, also known as divers disease or the bends 
Avascular necrosis also causes bone to lose its smooth shape, possibly leading to severe arthritis 
PreventionTo reduce the risk of avascular necrosis and improve general health 
Heavy drinking is one of the top risk factors for developing avascular necrosis 
Tiny bits of fat are the most common substance blocking blood supply to bones 
Steroid related bone damage appears to worsen with repeated courses of high dose steroids 
Aspergillosis Overview Aspergillosis is an infection caused by a type of mold fungus 
The mold that triggers the illnesses, aspergillus, is everywhere indoors and outdoors 
Signs and symptoms of this condition, known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, include 
A cough that may bring up blood or plugs of mucus 
Aspergillomas may produce no symptoms or cause only a mild cough at first 
Although aspergillosis may not be the cause, it s important to have breathing problems evaluated 
In the case of invasive aspergillosis, prompt treatment is crucial 
Outdoors, it s found in decaying leaves and compost and on plants, trees and grain crops 
Everyday exposure to aspergillus is rarely a problem for people with healthy immune systems 
When mold spores are inhaled, immune system cells surround and destroy them 
In general, these factors make you more vulnerable to infection 
People in the later stages of AIDS also may be at increased risk 
So does having chronic granulomatous disease an inherited disorder that affects immune system cells 
Complications Depending on the type of infection, aspergillosis can cause a variety of serious complications 
Both aspergillomas and invasive aspergillosis can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, bleeding in your lungs 
Asthma can t be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled 
Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children 
Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome 
For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations 
Exercise induced asthma, which may be worse when the air is cold and dry 
Occupational asthma, triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust 
Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity 
If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control 
Don t take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first 
Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse 
Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments 
Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD , a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat 
A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma 
Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling 
Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing 
Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities 
Side effects from long term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma 
Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment 
Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life 
Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare ups 
Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers 
A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out 
Your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home 
If you act quickly, you re less likely to have a severe attack 
You also won t need as much medication to control your symptoms 
Also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack 
If your symptoms don t improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan 
It s a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit 
Your doctor can make sure you re using your medications correctly and taking the right dose 
Overview An asthma attack is a sudden worsening of asthma symptoms 
People who already have a diagnosis of asthma usually have an asthma action plan 
Frequent asthma attacks show that a person s asthma is not under control 
An asthma attack also is called an asthma exacerbation or asthma flare up 
An asthma action plan often includes steps to take based on a peak flow reading 
The plan tells you what dose of long term control medicine to take every day 
The yellow zone tells you what to do if you have asthma symptoms 
It explains when to use a quick relief inhaler and how many puffs to take 
Peak flow readings are to of your best 
Peak flow readings are below of your personal best 
Checkups for asthma controlIt s important to keep regular appointments with your healthcare professional 
These might include taking a new medicine or higher doses of a medicine 
Asthma attacks occur when something triggers the immune system to take action 
Allergic reaction to pollen, pets, mold, cockroaches and dust mites 
Colds, the flu or other illnesses affecting the nose, mouth and throat 
Pain relievers, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti inflammatories, and some other medicines 
Risk factors Anyone who has asthma is at risk of an asthma attack 
Complications Asthma attacks affect both a person s health and quality of life 
PreventionAn important step to prevent an allergy attack is to follow your asthma action plan 
Get tested for possible allergies and take allergy medicines as directed 
Wash your hands frequently to lower the risk of getting a cold or the flu 
Cover your mouth with a scarf or mask on cold days 
Such triggers include inhaling pollen or catching a cold or other respiratory infection 
Childhood asthma can cause irritating daily symptoms that interfere with play, sports, school and sleep 
In some children, unmanaged asthma can cause dangerous asthma attacks 
Childhood asthma isn t a different disease from asthma in adults, but children face unique challenges 
The condition is a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations and missed school days 
Unfortunately, childhood asthma can t be cured, and symptoms can continue into adulthood 
Trouble sleeping due to shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing 
Bouts of coughing or wheezing that get worse with a cold or the flu 
Asthma symptoms vary from child to child and might get worse or better over time 
Your child might have only one symptom, such as a lingering cough or chest congestion 
It can be difficult to tell whether your child s symptoms are caused by asthma 
Wheezing and other asthma like symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or another respiratory problem 
Early treatment will help control symptoms and possibly prevent asthma attacks 
Make an appointment with your child s provider if you notice 
Coughing that is constant, is intermittent or seems linked to physical activity 
Listen for coughing in children, which might not wake them, when they are asleep 
Crying, laughing, yelling, or strong emotional reactions and stress also might trigger coughing or wheezing 
Your child might have an increased heartbeat, sweating and chest pain 
A tendency to develop allergies that runs in the family 
Some types of airway infections at a very young age 
Exposure to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke or other air pollution 
Reaction to a trigger can be delayed, making it more difficult to identify the trigger 
Risk factors Factors that might increase your child s chance of developing asthma include 
Previous allergic reactions, including skin reactions, food allergies or hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis 
Respiratory conditions, such as a chronic runny or stuffy nose, inflamed sinuses, or pneumonia 
Severe asthma attacks that require emergency treatment or hospital care 
PreventionCareful planning and avoiding asthma triggers are the best ways to prevent asthma attacks 
Help your child avoid the allergens and irritants that trigger asthma symptoms 
Consulting your child s provider can help you make needed treatment adjustments to control symptoms 
Acid reflux or severe heartburn might worsen your child s asthma symptoms 
It causes shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and other symptoms during or after exercise 
The medical term for this condition is exercise induced bronchoconstriction brong koh kun STRIK shun 
Treatment includes asthma medicines and taking steps to prevent symptoms before physical activity starts 
SymptomsSymptoms of exercise induced bronchoconstriction usually begin during or soon after exercise 
These symptoms can last for an hour or longer if untreated 
Shortness of breath or wheezing that is quickly getting worse, making it hard to breathe 
No improvement even after using a prescription inhaler for asthma attacks 
For a long time, the cause was thought to be cold air 
However, recent studies found dry air to be a more likely culprit 
Risk factors Exercise induced bronchoconstriction is more likely to occur in 
However, the condition also can occur in people without asthma 
Although anyone can have exercise induced bronchoconstriction, it s more common in high level athletes 
Factors that can increase the risk of the condition or act as triggers include 
In a gym setting, fumes from perfume, paint, new equipment or carpet 
Activities with long periods of deep breathing, such as long distance running, swimming or soccer 
Serious or life threatening breathing difficulties, particularly among people with poorly managed asthma 
These substances can trigger an immune system response that changes how the lungs work 
Begin right after exposure to a substance, later in the day or after work 
May become permanent even after long periods away from work 
When to see a doctorSeek medical treatment right away if your symptoms worsen 
Symptoms of an asthma attack that need emergency treatment include 
Causes More than workplace substances have been identified as possible triggers of occupational asthma 
Animal proteins found in dander, hair, scales, fur, saliva and body wastes 
Chemicals used to make paints, varnishes, adhesives, laminates and soldering resin 
Other examples include chemicals used to make insulation, packaging materials, and foam mattresses and upholstery 
Irritating gases or particles, such as chlorine gas, sulfur dioxide and smoke 
These changes narrow the airways and make it difficult to breathe 
Some substances are known to be lung irritants and asthma triggers 
High risk jobsIt s possible to develop occupational asthma in almost any workplace 
Some of the riskiest jobs linked to asthma producing substances include the following 
Spray painters, insulation installers, plastics and foam industry workers, welders, metalworkers, chemical manufacturers, shellac handlers 
In some cases, exposure to airborne asthma triggers can cause permanent changes to your lungs 
Medicines may help relieve symptoms and control inflammation linked to occupational asthma 
Being smoke free may help prevent or lessen symptoms of occupational asthma 
Avoid nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs and other medicines that may make symptoms worse 
For people with obesity, losing weight can help improve symptoms and overall lung health 
Tell you if you ll be working with any harmful chemicals 
Train you how to respond to an emergency, such as a chemical spill 
Offer extra training when a new chemical is used at your workplace 
This is a document that must be submitted by the chemical s manufacturer to your employer 
You have a legal right to see and copy such documents 
While at work, watch for conditions that may not be safe or healthy 
If necessary, call OSHA at OSHA and ask for an on site inspection 
You can do this so that your name won t be revealed to your employer 
Instead of having one curve like a round ball, the surface is egg shaped 
Astigmatism is often present at birth and may occur in combination with nearsightedness or farsightedness 
When it is, treatment options are corrective lenses or surgery 
An eye doctor can determine whether you have astigmatism and, if so, to what degree 
He or she can then advise you of your options to correct your vision 
The cornea, the clear front surface of the eye along with the tear film 
These two images overlap or combine and result in blurred vision 
You have corneal astigmatism if your cornea has mismatched curves 
You have lenticular astigmatism if your lens has mismatched curves 
Blurred vision may occur more in one direction horizontally, vertically or diagonally 
Other refractive errorsAstigmatism may occur in combination with other refractive errors, which include 
AstrocytomaAstrocytoma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord 
The growth, called a tumor, starts in cells called astrocytes 
Astrocytes support and connect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord 
An astrocytoma in the brain can cause personality changes, seizures, headaches and nausea 
Most astrocytomas grow quickly and are considered to be brain cancers 
Your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes will be checked 
Imaging tests can help figure out the location and size of the brain tumor 
Other imaging tests may include CT and positron emission tomography scans, also called PET scans 
Often the sample is taken during surgery to remove the astrocytoma 
Tests can determine the types of cells and how quickly they grow 
Special tests can show detailed information about the tumor cells 
Tests might look for changes in the genetic material of the tumor cells, called DNA 
The results tell your health care team about your prognosis 
Your team uses this information to create a treatment plan 
Sometimes the tumor is in a spot that is hard to reach 
Even so, removing some of the astrocytoma may lower your symptoms 
For some people, surgery may be the only treatment needed 
Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill tumor cells 
The machine sends beams to exact points in your brain 
Radiation may be used with chemotherapy for cancers that grow quickly 
Chemotherapy medicines can be taken in pill form or injected into a vein 
Sometimes, a circular wafer of chemotherapy medicine can be put in your brain after surgery 
Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to kill any tumor cells that might remain 
These studies offer a chance to try the latest treatment options 
Often, palliative care begins as you start your astrocytoma treatments 
Atrial tachycardiaAtrial tachycardia is a fast heartbeat, called an arrhythmia 
During an atrial tachycardia episode, the heart beats more than times a minute 
Then it returns to a heart rate of around to beats a minute 
An episode may start slowly or it may start suddenly and quickly 
It can cause a pounding or racing heartbeat, light headedness, dizziness, and fainting 
It may occur in people who have had heart surgery or who are pregnant 
DiagnosisTests and procedures used to diagnose atrial tachycardia may include 
Other tests may be done to try to trigger an episode of atrial tachycardia 
It shows how electrical signals spread through the heart during each heartbeat 
TreatmentTreatment of atrial tachycardia depends on what causes it and how severe it is 
Medicines may be given to control the heart rate and reset the heart rhythm 
This small device may be needed if other treatments for atrial tachycardia don t work 
It s surgically placed under the skin in the chest area 
Overview Ataxia describes poor muscle control that causes clumsy movements 
It can affect walking and balance, hand coordination, speech and swallowing, and eye movements 
Devices such as walkers and canes might help maintain independence 
Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and regular exercise also might help 
Ataxia can be a symptom of several nervous system conditions 
Trouble with fine motor tasks such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt 
The cerebellum is located at the base of the brain and connects to the brainstem 
The cerebellum helps control balance, eye movements, swallowing and speech 
There are three major groups of ataxia causes acquired, degenerative and hereditary 
It can be caused by sedatives such as phenobarbital and benzodiazepines 
It also may be caused by anti seizure medicines, especially phenytoin 
Too little or too much vitamin B also may cause ataxia 
Not getting enough of a certain vitamin is known as a vitamin deficiency 
When a vitamin deficiency is the cause of ataxia, it often can be reversed 
This may be either due to a blood vessel blockage or bleeding on the brain 
Ataxia can result from a serious infection with the virus that causes COVID 
Paraneoplastic syndromes most often occur from lung, ovarian or breast cancer or lymphoma 
Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed 
An infected area in the brain, known as an abscess, may cause ataxia 
The damage may happen before, during or shortly after birth 
This rare condition affects movements and functions such as blood pressure 
Some types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are passed down in families 
They cause the nerve cells to break down and die, known as degeneration 
In a recessive condition, the parents are not affected but siblings may be affected 
Each type causes poor coordination but also has other specific symptoms 
Researchers have identified more than spinocerebellar ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow 
Ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, and there may be other symptoms 
EA involves brief bouts of ataxia that may last seconds or minutes 
The bouts are triggered by stress, sudden movement or being startled 
EA involves longer bouts of ataxia, usually lasting from minutes to six hours 
Episodic ataxia doesn t shorten life span, and symptoms may respond to medicine 
It involves damage to the cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nerves 
Peripheral nerves carry signals from the arms and legs to the brain and spinal cord 
A brain scan usually doesn t show changes to the cerebellum with this type of ataxia 
The first symptom of Friedreich ataxia often is trouble walking 
The condition typically goes on to affect the arms and trunk 
This type of ataxia can cause changes to the feet, such as high arches 
It also can cause a curve of the spine, known as scoliosis 
Other symptoms that might develop include slurred speech, fatigue, irregular eye movements and hearing loss 
Friedreich ataxia also may lead to heart enlargement, known as cardiomyopathy 
Early treatment of heart conditions can improve quality of life and survival 
This is the most common cause of ataxia that happens later in life 
The ataxia symptoms usually occur with dizziness and numbness or tingling in the body 
This rare childhood disease causes degeneration in the brain and immune system 
This increases the risk of other diseases, including infections and tumors 
Delayed motor skill development, poor balance and slurred speech are often the first symptoms 
Children with ataxia telangiectasia are at high risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia or lymphoma 
This type of ataxia results from damage to the cerebellum that s present at birth 
In people with this condition, copper builds up in the brain, liver and other organs 
Risk factors There are several risk factors for ataxia 
Having an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten, known as celiac disease 
Taking medicines that increase the risk of ataxia, such as anti seizure medicines and sedatives 
Getting too much vitamin B also is a risk factor 
It happens when tiny air sacs within the lung, called alveoli, lose air 
Atelectasis is one of the most common breathing complications after surgery 
You may develop atelectasis if you breathe in a foreign object 
This condition can make breathing hard, particularly if you already have lung disease 
Treatment depends on what s causing the collapse and how severe it is 
If your breathing suddenly becomes difficult, get emergency medical help 
It changes your regular pattern of breathing and affects the exchange of lung gases 
This can cause the air sacs in your lungs to lose air 
Nearly everyone who has major surgery has some amount of atelectasis 
When a blocked airway causes atelectasis, it may be due to 
A mucus plug is a buildup of sputum or phlegm in your airways 
It commonly occurs during and after surgery because you can t cough 
A growth, which may or may not be cancer, can narrow or block the airway 
Possible causes of atelectasis due to pressure from outside the lung include 
Various types of pneumonia, which is a lung infection, can cause atelectasis 
A large tumor can press against the lung and force air out of it 
Risk factors Factors that make you more likely to get atelectasis include 
Weak breathing muscles due to muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury or another neuromuscular condition 
Complications A small area of atelectasis, especially in adults, usually can be treated 
Atelectasis makes it harder for your lungs to get oxygen to the air sacs 
Your risk of pneumonia continues until the atelectasis goes away 
PreventionAtelectasis in children is often caused by a blockage in the airway 
To lower the risk of atelectasis, keep small objects out of the reach of children 
If you re scheduled for surgery, talk with your doctor about ways to lower your risk 
Signs and symptoms of athlete s foot include an itchy, scaly rash 
The condition is contagious and can be spread via contaminated floors, towels or clothing 
Athlete s foot is closely related to other fungal infections such as ringworm and jock itch 
It can be treated with antifungal medications, but the infection often comes back 
Inflamed skin that might appear reddish, purplish or grayish, depending on your skin color 
Dry, scaly skin on the bottom of the foot that extends up the side 
If you have diabetes, see your doctor if you suspect that you have athlete s foot 
Damp socks and shoes and warm, humid conditions favor the organisms growth 
Risk factors You are at higher risk of athlete s foot if you 
Share mats, rugs, bed linens, clothes or shoes with someone who has a fungal infection 
Complications The athlete s foot infection can spread to other warm, moist parts of the body 
Jock itch is often caused by the same fungus that results in athlete s foot 
PreventionThese tips can help you avoid athlete s foot or avoid spreading it to others 
When you can, wear sandals to let your feet air out as much as possible 
Use warm, soapy water and rinse and dry your feet thoroughly, especially between the toes 
Be aware of the risk factors for spreading the condition 
If you live with others, don t share shoes or unwashed bedding and towels 
Overview Atopic dermatitis eczema is a condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin 
It s common in young children but can occur at any age 
Atopic dermatitis is long lasting chronic and tends to flare sometimes 
People with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing food allergies, hay fever and asthma 
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color 
When to see a doctorTalk with a health care provider if you or your child 
Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities 
Has a skin infection look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs 
This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin s barrier function 
Atopic dermatitis eczema is one of several types of dermatitis 
Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis dandruff 
Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk 
Complications Complications of atopic dermatitis eczema may include 
Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever 
One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives urticaria 
A skin condition called neurodermatitis lichen simplex chronicus starts with a patch of itchy skin 
Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin 
This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery 
Patches of skin that s darker or lighter than the surrounding area 
This complication after the rash has healed is called post inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation 
It s more common in people with brown or Black skin 
It might take several months for the discoloration to fade 
Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks 
These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses 
Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you re allergic to 
The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color 
PreventionDeveloping a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares 
The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing 
Choose a product or products that work well for you 
Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented 
Using petroleum jelly on your baby s skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis 
Choose a cleanser that s free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance 
Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children 
After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel 
Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp within three minutes 
The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person 
Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema 
In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare 
Talk with your child s health care provider about identifying potential food allergies 
Overview In atrial flutter, the heart s upper chambers atria beat too quickly 
This causes the heart to beat in a fast, but usually regular, rhythm 
Sometimes a person may have episodes of both atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation 
However, the disorder can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and other complications 
Atrioventricular canal defect Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Children born with this condition have a hole in the wall between the heart s chambers 
They also have problems with the valves that control blood flow in the heart 
Atrioventricular canal defect allows extra blood to flow to the lungs 
Untreated, atrioventricular canal defect can cause heart failure and high blood pressure in the lungs 
Symptoms depend on whether the defect is partial or complete 
Symptoms of a complete atrioventricular canal defect usually develop in the first weeks of life 
Blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels 
Partial defectThe condition affects only the two upper heart chambers 
Symptoms of a partial atrioventricular canal defect may not appear until early adulthood 
Causes Atrioventricular canal defect occurs before birth when a baby s heart is developing 
From there, the blood flows to the rest of the body 
Valves control blood flow into and out of the heart chambers 
What happens in atrioventricular canal defectIn a partial atrioventricular canal defect 
There s a hole in the heart s wall between the upper chambers 
There are also changes in the tricuspid and mitral valves 
The changes prevent the valves from closing all the way 
Blood can move the wrong way through the irregular valve opening 
The mitral valve between the upper and lower left chambers is most often affected 
There s a large hole in the center of the heart 
The hole is where the walls between the upper and the lower chambers meet 
There s one large valve between the heart s upper and lower chambers, instead of separate ones 
Blood leaks through the one large valve into the lower heart chambers 
Risk factors Things that might increase the risk of atrioventricular canal defect include 
For instance, children with Down syndrome often have heart problems present at birth 
Having rubella during pregnancy may affect how the baby s heart develops while in the womb 
Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy may affect a baby s heart development 
Gestational diabetes generally doesn t increase the risk of congenital heart disease 
Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby 
Always tell your health care provider about the medications you take 
A hole in the heart lets oxygen rich blood mix with oxygen poor blood 
A hole in the heart can lead to repeated lung infections 
Treatment greatly improves the outlook for children with atrioventricular canal defect 
This type of care provider is called an adult congenital cardiologist 
Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed during pregnancy 
Some heart problems are passed down in families, which means they are inherited 
People with AVNRT have an irregularly fast heartbeat that often starts and ends suddenly 
In AVNRT, the heart beats more than times a minute 
The condition is due to a change in heart signaling 
There is an extra pathway for heart signals to travel, called a reentrant circuit 
That extra pathway causes the heart to beat too early 
When recommended, treatment may include specific actions or movements, medicines, or a heart procedure 
DiagnosisTests used to diagnose atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia AVNRT may include 
Electrocardiogram ECG to check the electrical activity of the heart and look at the heartbeat 
Echocardiogram, which uses sound waves to make pictures of the heart s size, structure and motion 
A healthcare professional might try to trigger AVNRT with other tests, which may include 
TreatmentMost people with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia AVNRT don t need treatment 
Cardioversion is typically used when vagal maneuvers and medicines don t work 
The scars block irregular electrical signals and restore a typical heartbeat 
Simple, effective treatments for genitourinary syndrome of menopause GSM are available 
Causes Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is caused by a decrease in estrogen production 
Less estrogen makes your vaginal tissues thinner, drier, less elastic and more fragile 
While taking medications that can affect estrogen levels, such as some birth control pills 
Although the condition is common, not all menopausal women experience GSM 
Regular sexual activity, with or without a partner, can help you maintain healthy vaginal tissues 
Risk factors Certain factors may contribute to GSM, such as 
Smoking also reduces the effects of naturally occurring estrogens in your body 
Changes in the acid balance of your vagina make vaginal infections more likely 
Urinary changes associated with GSM can contribute to urinary problems 
You might experience increased frequency or urgency of urination or burning with urination 
Some women experience more urinary tract infections or urine leakage incontinence 
Sexual activity increases blood flow to your vagina, which helps keep vaginal tissues healthy 
Reactive attachment disorder Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Not seeking comfort or showing no response when comfort is given 
Their basic emotional and physical needs must be consistently met by caregivers 
It s not clear why some babies and children develop reactive attachment disorder and others don t 
However, most children who are severely neglected don t develop reactive attachment disorder 
Provide warm, nurturing interaction with your child, such as during feeding, bathing or changing diapers 
This will help you learn how to interact in a nurturing manner 
Overview Atypical hyperplasia is a precancerous condition that affects cells in the breast 
Atypical hyperplasia isn t cancer, but it increases the risk of breast cancer 
The appearance of the abnormal cells determines the type of atypical hyperplasia 
Atypical ductal hyperplasia describes abnormal cells within the breast ducts 
Atypical lobular hyperplasia describes abnormal cells within the breast lobules 
The excess cells stack upon one another and begin to take on an abnormal appearance 
Invasive cancer tends to invade surrounding tissue, blood vessels or lymph channels 
The risk is similar for atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia 
Researchers who studied women with atypical hyperplasia found breast cancer risk increased over time 
Understanding your risk can help you make decisions about breast cancer screening and risk reducing medications 
The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior 
Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year 
Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder 
Doesn t speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences 
Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn t understand how to use them 
Doesn t express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others feelings 
Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive 
Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping 
Performs activities that could cause self harm, such as biting or head banging 
Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change 
Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus 
Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near normal lives 
The symptoms associated with the disorder can also be linked with other developmental disorders 
Doesn t respond with a smile or happy expression by months 
Doesn t gesture such as point or wave by months 
Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder 
For other children, genetic changes mutations may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder 
Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously 
Risk factors The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is rising 
Boys are about four times more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls are 
Complications Problems with social interactions, communication and behavior can lead to 
PreventionThere s no way to prevent autism spectrum disorder, but there are treatment options 
Early diagnosis and intervention is most helpful and can improve behavior, skills and language development 
Though children usually don t outgrow autism spectrum disorder symptoms, they may learn to function well 
Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes jaundice 
Types of autoimmune hepatitisDoctors have identified two main forms of autoimmune hepatitis 
Other autoimmune diseases may accompany this type of autoimmune hepatitis 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of autoimmune hepatitis include 
Autoimmune hepatitis may develop after you re infected with the measles, herpes simplex or Epstein Barr virus 
The disease is also linked to hepatitis A, B or C infection 
Evidence suggests that a predisposition to autoimmune hepatitis may run in families 
Complications Autoimmune hepatitis that goes untreated can cause permanent scarring of the liver tissue cirrhosis 
Liver disease can cause large amounts of fluid to accumulate in your abdomen 
People with cirrhosis have an increased risk of liver cancer 
It may be caused by the immune system attacking the pancreas 
Two subtypes of AIP are now recognized, type and type 
Type AIP can be mistakenly diagnosed as pancreatic cancer 
Symptoms of type AIP are like those of pancreatic cancer 
Pain in your upper belly or middle part of your back 
The most common sign of type AIP is painless jaundice 
About of people with type AIP have painless jaundice 
People with type AIP can have repeat episodes of acute pancreatitis 
In type AIP, the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas 
Type disease also is associated with another autoimmune condition called inflammatory bowel disease 
Type AIP mostly affects men in the sixth to seventh decade of life 
Type AIP is more likely to relapse after treatment is discontinued 
When to see a doctorAutoimmune pancreatitis often doesn t cause any symptoms 
Are often one or two decades younger than those with type 
Are more likely to have inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis 
AIP may affect the ability of your pancreas to make enough enzymes 
Symptoms may include diarrhea, weight loss, metabolic bone disease, and vitamin or mineral deficiency 
Because the pancreas is the organ that produces insulin, damage to it may cause diabetes 
Treatments for autoimmune pancreatitis, such as long term steroid use, can cause complications 
There is no established association between AIP and pancreatic cancer 
It can affect blood pressure, temperature control, digestion, bladder function and even sexual function 
These areas include the heart, blood vessels and sweat glands 
Symptoms and treatment vary based on which nerves are damaged 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy depend on which nerves are damaged 
Dizziness and fainting when standing, caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure 
Not being able to completely empty the bladder can lead to urinary tract infections 
Sexual difficulties, including problems achieving or maintaining an erection erectile dysfunction or ejaculation problems 
In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm 
These problems are all due to changes in digestive function 
Sweating problems, such as sweating too much or too little 
It can also be a side effect of treatments for other diseases, such as cancer 
Diabetes, especially when poorly controlled, is the most common cause of autonomic neuropathy 
Irregular protein buildup in organs amyloidosis , which affects the organs and the nervous system 
Examples include Sjogren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease 
Guillain Barre syndrome is an autoimmune disease that happens rapidly and can affect autonomic nerves 
Certain medications, including some drugs used in cancer treatment chemotherapy 
Risk factors Factors that might increase your risk of autonomic neuropathy include 
Diabetes, especially when poorly controlled, increases your risk of autonomic neuropathy and other nerve damage 
You re at greatest risk if you have difficulty controlling your blood sugar 
Some health conditions including amyloidosis, porphyria and hypothyroidism can increase the risk of autonomic neuropathy 
Cancer can too, usually due to side effects from treatment 
PreventionCertain inherited diseases that put you at risk of developing autonomic neuropathy can t be prevented 
To control diseases and conditions, follow your health care provider s advice on healthy living 
Other names for this condition are infantile acne and neonatal acne 
SymptomsBaby acne is small, inflamed bumps on a baby s face, neck, back or chest 
It often develops within to weeks of birth 
Many babies also develop tiny, pimple like bumps on the face 
Causes Baby acne is caused by hormones that the baby is exposed to before birth 
SymptomsBack pain can range from a muscle aching to a shooting, burning or stabbing sensation 
Bending, twisting, lifting, standing or walking can make it worse 
Spreads down one or both legs, especially if the pain goes below the knee 
Causes weakness, numbness, or tingling in one or both legs 
In rare cases, back pain can signal a serious medical problem 
Follows a fall, blow to the back or other injury 
Repeated heavy lifting or a sudden awkward movement can strain back muscles and spinal ligaments 
Disks act as cushions between the bones in the spine 
The soft material inside a disk can bulge or rupture and press on a nerve 
However, a bulging or ruptured disk might not cause back pain 
The spine s vertebrae can develop painful breaks if the bones become porous and brittle 
This inflammatory disease can cause some of the bones in the spine to fuse 
Risk factors Anyone can develop back pain, even children and teens 
These factors can increase the risk of developing back pain 
Back pain is more common with age, starting around age or 
Weak, unused muscles in the back and abdomen might lead to back pain 
Some types of arthritis and cancer can contribute to back pain 
Using the back instead of the legs can lead to back pain 
People prone to depression and anxiety appear to have a greater risk of back pain 
Stress can cause muscle tension, which can contribute to back pain 
This may occur because smoking causes coughing, which can lead to herniated disks 
Smoking also can decrease blood flow to the spine and increase the risk of osteoporosis 
Talk with your health care provider about which activities to try 
Choose a seat with good lower back support, armrests and a swivel base 
If you must lift something heavy, let your legs do the work 
Keep your back straight no twisting and bend only at the knees 
Find a lifting partner if the object is heavy or awkward 
Overview Bacterial vaginosis BV can cause discomfort and pain of the vagina 
It happens when natural bacteria levels are out of balance 
But when too much of some bacteria grow, it can lead to BV 
Also, bacterial vaginosis is more common among those who are sexually active 
But activities such as unprotected sex and douching raise your risk of having BV 
Thin, vaginal discharge that may be gray, white or green 
When to see a doctorMake an appointment to see a health care professional if 
Your doctor can help find the cause of your symptoms 
You ve had vaginal infections before but your discharge seems different this time 
You have a new sex partner or different sex partners 
You thought you had a yeast infection but still have symptoms after self treatment 
Causes Bacterial vaginosis happens when the vagina s natural bacteria levels are out of balance 
The bacteria in the vagina are called the vaginal flora 
The good bacteria are called lactobacilli the bad bacteria are anaerobes 
Risk factors Risk factors for bacterial vaginosis include 
The link between having sex and bacterial vaginosis isn t clear 
But BV happens more often when someone has different or new sex partners 
Also, BV is more common when the sex of both partners is female 
So rinsing your vagina with water or something else isn t needed 
It can lead to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, causing bacterial vaginosis 
If your vagina doesn t produce enough lactobacilli, you re more likely to develop bacterial vaginosis 
If you have BV, you have a higher risk of getting an STI 
This infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes raises the risk of infertility 
Past studies have shown a possible link between BV and problems with pregnancy 
New studies show that these risks may be due to other reasons 
If positive, your doctor can choose the best treatment for you 
Scented soaps and other scented products may inflame vaginal tissues 
Douching disrupts the vaginal flora, raising your risk of infection 
To lower your risk of STIs, use latex condoms or dental dams 
Limit your number of sex partners or don t have sex 
That s because they don t address the cause of the problem 
Certain foods, health conditions and habits are among the causes of bad breath 
If you still have bad breath after making changes, see your dentist 
Eating certain foods, such as onions, garlic and spices, also can cause bad breath 
A colorless, sticky film of bacteria called plaque forms on your teeth 
Eventually, it can form plaque filled pockets between your teeth and gums 
The early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis 
Saliva helps cleanse your mouth, removing particles that cause bad odors 
Dry mouth naturally occurs during sleep, leading to morning breath 
It gets worse if you sleep with your mouth open 
Some medicines can lead to bad breath by causing dry mouth 
Infections, or constant swelling in the nose, sinuses or throat, can lead to postnasal drip 
This is when fluid from your nose runs down the back of your throat 
Diseases such as some cancers can cause a distinctive breath odor 
In addition, other conditions such as GERD or cancer can lead to bad breath 
Overview Bags under eyes are mild swelling or puffiness under the eyes 
At home remedies, such as cool compresses, can help improve their appearance 
For persistent or bothersome under eye puffiness, eyelid surgery may be an option 
Fluid retention, especially upon waking or after a salty meal 
Medical conditions, such as dermatitis, dermatomyositis, renal disease and thyroid eye disease 
Overview A Baker cyst is a fluid filled growth behind the knee 
Also called a popliteal pop luh TEE ul cyst, a Baker cyst sometime causes pain 
Both conditions can cause the knee to produce too much fluid 
SymptomsIn some cases, a Baker cyst causes no pain, and you may not notice it 
But sometimes underlying conditions can cause the knee to produce too much synovial fluid 
Inflammation of the knee joint, which can occur with various types of arthritis 
Complications Rarely, a Baker cyst bursts and synovial fluid leaks into the calf region, causing 
Sometimes, redness of the calf or a feeling of water running down the calf 
You might feel as if the room is spinning or you re going to fall down 
These feelings can happen whether you re lying down, sitting or standing 
When these systems aren t functioning well, you can experience balance problems 
Causes Balance problems can be caused by several different conditions 
The cause of balance problems is usually related to the specific sign or symptom 
Sense of motion or spinning vertigo Vertigo can be associated with many conditions, including 
BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo in adults 
Symptoms are often severe and persistent, and include nausea and difficulty walking 
Symptoms can last several days and gradually improve without treatment 
This is a common disorder second to BPPV in adults 
Symptoms include unsteadiness or a sensation of motion in your head 
Dizziness and sensitivity to motion vestibular migraine can occur due to migraine 
This noncancerous benign , slow growing tumor develops on a nerve that affects your hearing and balance 
You might experience vertigo, ear pain, facial weakness and hearing loss 
You might experience vertigo due to a concussion or other head injury 
You might experience dizziness in boats, cars and airplanes, or on amusement park rides 
Loss of balance or unsteadinessLosing your balance while walking, or feeling imbalanced, can result from 
Muscle weakness and unstable joints can contribute to your loss of balance 
Loss of balance or unsteadiness can be a side effect of medications 
Depression major depressive disorder , anxiety and other psychiatric disorders can cause dizziness 
This condition often accompanies anxiety disorders and may cause lightheadedness 
Folliculitis Overview Folliculitis is a common skin condition that happens when hair follicles become inflamed 
Mild folliculitis will likely heal without scarring in a few days with basic self care 
Left untreated, severe infections can cause permanent hair loss and scarring 
Certain types of folliculitis are known as hot tub rash and barber s itch 
Types of folliculitisThe two main types of folliculitis are superficial and deep 
Types of folliculitis, with the most common listed first, include 
This common type is a rash of itchy, pus filled bumps 
It occurs when hair follicles become infected with bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus staph 
This rash can look like folliculitis but it s caused by ingrown hairs, not infected follicles 
People who get bikini waxes may get razor bumps in the groin area 
This type causes pus filled bumps around the nose and mouth 
It sometimes develops in people who are receiving long term antibiotic therapy for acne 
It mainly affects people with human immunodeficiency virus HIV acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS 
These occur when hair follicles become deeply infected with staph bacteria 
A boil tends to appear suddenly as a painful inflamed bump 
You may need a prescription strength antibiotic or antifungal medication to help control the condition 
Seek immediate medical care if you experience signs of a spreading infection 
It may also be caused by viruses, fungi, parasites, medications or physical injury 
Regularly wearing clothing that traps heat and sweat, such as rubber gloves or high boots 
Soaking in a hot tub, whirlpool or public pool that s not maintained well 
Having diabetes, HIV AIDS or another condition that lowers your resistance to infections 
PreventionYou can try to prevent folliculitis by using these tips 
Use a clean washcloth and towel each time and don t share your towels or washcloths 
Use hot, soapy water to wash towels, washcloths and any oil soaked uniforms or other clothing 
If you shave, adopt these habits to help control symptoms 
Using a clean, sharp blade and rinsing it with warm water after each stroke 
Try hair removing products depilatories or other methods of hair removal 
You might need a five day course of a prescription antibacterial ointment 
And you may need to use a body wash with chlorhexidine Hibiclens, Hibistat, others 
Mitral valve prolapse Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Usually, mitral valve prolapse isn t life threatening and doesn t require treatment or lifestyle changes 
But some people may need medications or surgery, especially if the prolapse causes severe regurgitation 
Mitral valve prolapse symptoms can vary widely from one person to another 
Many people with mitral valve prolapse don t have noticeable symptoms 
Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, especially during exercise or when lying flat 
If you ve been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse, see your provider if your symptoms worsen 
Each valve has flaps leaflets that open and close once during each heartbeat 
If blood leaks backward through the valve, the condition is called mitral valve regurgitation 
Risk factors Mitral valve prolapse can develop in any person at any age 
Being male or having high blood pressure increases the risk of mitral valve regurgitation 
GERD is often accompanied by symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation 
Barrett s esophagus is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer 
If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated to prevent esophageal cancer 
Have chest pain, which may be a symptom of a heart attack 
Are vomiting red blood or blood that looks like coffee grounds 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of Barrett s esophagus include 
White people have a greater risk of the disease than do people of other races 
Barrett s esophagus can occur at any age but is more common in adults over 
Complications People with Barrett s esophagus have an increased risk of esophageal cancer 
The risk is small, even in people who have precancerous changes in their esophagus cells 
Fortunately, most people with Barrett s esophagus will never develop esophageal cancer 
Basal cell carcinoma Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Basal cell carcinoma Overview Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer 
Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma 
These changes in the skin lesions usually have one of the following characteristics 
A shiny, skin colored bump that s translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface 
The bump can look pearly white or pink on white skin 
On brown and Black skin, the bump often looks brown or glossy black 
A white, waxy, scar like lesion without a clearly defined border 
The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell s DNA 
The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of basal cell carcinoma include 
Complications Complications of basal cell carcinoma can include 
PreventionTo reduce your risk of basal cell carcinoma you can 
Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least , even on cloudy days 
Tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer 
Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor 
Examine your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands 
You may seek out numerous cosmetic procedures to try to fix your perceived flaw 
Treatment of body dysmorphic disorder may include cognitive behavioral therapy and medication 
Attempting to hide perceived flaws with styling, makeup or clothes 
You may excessively focus over one or more parts of your body 
The bodily feature that you focus on may change over time 
The most common features people tend to fixate about include 
Face, such as nose, complexion, wrinkles, acne and other blemishes 
Body dysmorphic disorder usually doesn t get better on its own 
Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common with body dysmorphic disorder 
If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, get help right away 
In the U S, call or your local emergency number immediately 
Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community 
Causes It s not known specifically what causes body dysmorphic disorder 
Certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering body dysmorphic disorder, including 
Having blood relatives with body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder 
Negative life experiences, such as childhood teasing, neglect or abuse 
Having another mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression 
Physical pain or risk of disfigurement due to repeated surgical interventions 
Long term maintenance treatment also may help prevent a relapse of body dysmorphic disorder symptoms 
Bedbug bites usually clear up without treatment in a week or two 
If you have bedbugs in your home, professional extermination is recommended 
SymptomsSymptoms of bedbug bites are similar to symptoms of other insect bites and rashes 
Inflamed spots, often with a darker spot in the middle 
Where do they hide Bedbug infestations usually occur around or near where people sleep 
Bedbugs can easily travel between floors and rooms in hotels or apartment buildings 
Sign of uncleanliness Bedbugs don t care if their environment is clean or dirty 
All they need is a warm host and plenty of hiding places 
Look over used bedding, mattresses and upholstered furniture before bringing them into your home 
Bedsores also are called pressure ulcers, pressure injuries and decubitus ulcers 
Or they spend most of their time in a bed or a chair 
Most sores heal with treatment, but some never heal completely 
You can take steps to put a stop to bedsores and help them heal 
An area of skin that feels cooler or warmer to the touch than other areas 
Backs of arms and legs where they rest against a chair 
For people who need to stay in bed, bedsores may happen on the 
If the area doesn t improve in to hours, contact your healthcare professional 
Seek medical care right away if you notice signs of infection 
Causes Pressure against the skin that limits blood flow to the skin causes bedsores 
Limited movement can make skin prone to damage and cause bedsores 
Constant pressure on any part of the body can lessen the blood flow to tissues 
Blood flow is essential to deliver oxygen and other nutrients to tissues 
Without these key nutrients, skin and nearby tissues are damaged and might die over time 
Limited movement can make skin prone to the damage that the pressure causes 
These areas include the spine, tailbone, shoulder blades, hips, heels and elbows 
Friction occurs when the skin rubs against clothing or bedding 
Shear occurs when two surfaces move in the opposite direction 
This might be due to poor health, spinal cord injury or another cause 
Skin becomes more vulnerable with extended exposure to urine and stool 
Spinal cord injuries, neurological disorders and other conditions can make you lose sensation 
Examples of these types of medical conditions are diabetes and vascular disease 
If you re over , you re more likely to be affected by bedsores 
Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and connected soft tissues 
It can cause warmth and swelling of the affected area 
People with nerve damage often don t feel pain in the area cellulitis affects 
An infection from a bedsore can burrow into joints and bones 
Joint infections, such as septic arthritis, can damage cartilage and tissue 
Bone infections, also known as osteomyelitis, can reduce the function of joints and limbs 
Rarely, a skin ulcer leads to sepsis, which is a life threatening complication of an infection 
Frequently change your position to avoid stress on the skin 
Tips for repositioningConsider these recommendations related to changing position in a bed or chair 
Ask for help with changing your position every two hours 
If you have enough upper body strength, do wheelchair pushups 
Raise your body off the seat by pushing on the arms of the chair 
Some wheelchairs allow you to tilt them, which can relieve pressure 
If possible, do not raise the head of the bed above degrees 
Wash the skin with a gentle cleanser and pat dry 
Do this cleansing routine regularly to limit the skin s exposure to moisture, urine and stool 
Use moisture barrier creams to protect the skin from urine and stool 
Look closely at your skin daily for warning signs of a bedsore 
This happens after the age at which staying dry at night can be reasonably expected 
But don t get upset if your child wets the bed 
It s often just a typical part of a child s development 
At this age, your child may still be developing nighttime bladder control 
If your child continues to wet the bed, treat the problem with patience and understanding 
Lifestyle changes, bladder training, moisture alarms and sometimes medicine may help lessen bed wetting 
Between the ages of and , bed wetting remains a problem for some children 
After years of age, a small number of children still wet the bed 
Talk to your child s doctor or other health care professional if 
This may be especially true if your child is a deep sleeper 
During childhood, some kids do not produce enough anti diuretic hormone, also called ADH 
ADH slows down how much urine is made during the night 
Sleep apnea is when a child s breathing is interrupted during sleep 
This is often due to swollen and irritated or enlarged tonsils or adenoids 
Other symptoms may include snoring and being sleepy during the day 
Several factors have been linked with an increased risk of bed wetting, including 
Although frustrating, bed wetting without a physical cause does not result in any health risks 
But bed wetting can create some issues for your child, including 
Loss of opportunities for social activities, such as sleepovers and camp 
Mild reactionMost of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include 
In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours 
Moderate reactions tend to resolve over five to days 
But some people develop similar moderate reactions each time they re stung 
In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings 
Seek prompt medical care if you ve been swarmed by bees and have multiple stings 
Bee sting symptoms don t go away within a few days 
You ve had other symptoms of an allergic response to a bee sting 
Causes To sting, a bee jabs a barbed stinger into the skin 
Risk factors You re at increased risk of bee stings if 
You live in an area where bees are especially active or with beehives nearby 
PreventionThe following tips can help reduce your risk of getting stung by bees 
Clear away garbage, fallen fruit, and dog or other animal feces flies can attract wasps 
Don t wear bright colors or floral prints, which can attract bees 
Don t wear loose clothing, which can trap bees between the cloth and your skin 
Have hives and nests near your home removed by a professional 
When a bee stings, it releases a chemical that attracts other bees 
If you can, get into a building or closed vehicle 
The disease can lead to numerous signs and symptoms that can seem unrelated at first 
They can include mouth sores, eye inflammation, skin rashes and lesions, and genital sores 
Signs and symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected 
They begin as raised, round lesions in the mouth that quickly turn into painful ulcers 
The sores usually heal in one to three weeks, though they do recur 
Others develop red, raised and tender nodules on their skin, especially on the lower legs 
Red, open sores can occur on the scrotum or the vulva 
Inflammation in the eye uveitis causes redness, pain and blurred vision, typically in both eyes 
In people with Behcet s disease, the condition can come and go 
Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet s disease 
Signs and symptoms can last one to three weeks and go away on their own 
It s likely that genetic and environmental factors play a role 
The condition can involve arteries and veins of all sizes, damaging them throughout the body 
Several genes have been found to be associated with the disease 
Risk factors Factors that might increase your risk of Behcet s include 
Having certain genes is associated with a higher risk of developing Behcet s 
Complications Complications of Behcet s disease depend on your signs and symptoms 
For instance, untreated uveitis can lead to decreased vision or blindness 
The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop 
Smiles are one sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close 
Bell s palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause 
Bell s palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection 
A small number of people continue to have some Bell s palsy symptoms for life 
SymptomsSymptoms of Bell s palsy come on suddenly and may include 
Facial droop and trouble making facial expressions, such as closing an eye or smiling 
Pain around the jaw or pain in or behind the ear on the affected side 
Rarely, Bell s palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face 
Viruses that have been linked to Bell s palsy include viruses that cause 
Cold sores and genital herpes, also known as herpes simplex 
Risk factors Bell s palsy occurs more often in people who 
Have an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold 
But when it does, there s often a family history of repeated attacks 
This suggests that Bell s palsy might have something to do with genes 
Complications Mild symptoms of Bell s palsy typically disappear within a month 
For example, when you smile, the eye on the affected side may close 
Partial or complete blindness of the eye that won t close 
Overview Geographic tongue is an inflammatory but harmless condition affecting the surface of the tongue 
The tongue usually is covered with tiny, pinkish white bumps called papillae 
With geographic tongue, patches on the surface of the tongue are missing papillae 
These patches are smooth and red, often with slightly raised borders 
Although geographic tongue may look alarming, it does not cause health issues 
Smooth, red, irregularly shaped patches on the top or side of your tongue 
Frequent changes in the location, size and shape of the patches 
The problem often goes away on its own, but it may appear again later 
In some cases, medicine may be prescribed to help ease symptoms 
There may be a link between geographic tongue and other conditions, such as psoriasis 
This is a skin disease that causes a rash with itchy, scaly patches 
But more research is needed to learn about possible connections to other health conditions 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of geographic tongue include 
Some people with geographic tongue have a family history of it 
People with geographic tongue often have a condition called fissured tongue 
This is when deep grooves, called fissures, appear on the surface of the tongue 
Complications Geographic tongue is harmless, but it can sometimes be uncomfortable 
It also may be hard to believe that nothing is seriously wrong 
It is usually triggered by specific changes in your head s position 
You can receive effective treatment for BPPV during a doctor s office visit 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV may include 
A sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving vertigo 
Episodes of BPPV can disappear for some time and then recur 
Some people also feel out of balance when standing or walking 
Abnormal rhythmic eye movements usually accompany the symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 
The signs and symptoms listed above may signal a more serious problem 
The ear s roleInside your ear is a tiny organ called the vestibular labyrinth 
These otolith organs contain crystals that make you sensitive to gravity 
BPPV is also more common in women than in men 
Several different types of tumors may form on the peripheral nerves 
Most of these types of tumors are not cancerous benign 
But they can lead to nerve damage and loss of muscle control 
TypesPeripheral nerve tumors affect nerves by growing within them or by pressing against them 
Peripheral nerve tumors that grow within nerves are called intraneural tumors 
The tumors that press against nerves are called extraneural tumors 
If you develop a schwannoma in an arm or leg, you might notice a mass 
But you might have a schwannoma for years before noticing it 
Occasionally some people have several of them in the arms, legs or body 
This type of tumor also is known as a vestibular schwannoma 
It sometimes occurs in people with a condition called neurofibromatosis NF 
A neurofibroma might arise from several nerve bundles and tends to cause mild symptoms 
This tumor most commonly develops in people who have neurofibromatosis NF 
This is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerves 
Symptoms of NF include color changes and benign tumors on the skin 
People with NF are at risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 
A perineurioma can form within a nerve, called an intraneural perineurioma 
It may also form in soft next to a nerve, called an extraneural perineurioma 
An intraneural perineurioma happens most often in children and young adults 
It typically causes gradually progressive weakness and loss of feeling in an arm or leg 
Usually, though, a lipoma causes no pain or other problems 
Your health care provider might want to monitor a lipoma through regular checkups 
Some ganglion cysts come from an injury, but most have no known cause 
Some go away without treatment, but ganglion cysts that press neighboring nerves should be removed 
Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and which tissues it affects 
Causes The cause of benign peripheral nerve tumors usually isn t known 
The most common type of benign peripheral nerve tumor is a schwannoma 
Perineuriomas are rare and can grow from inside or outside the nerve 
Tumors outside a nerve can cause problems when they press on the nerve 
Overview Benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH is a health issue that becomes more common with age 
The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen 
It also can cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems 
Weak urine stream, or a stream that stops and starts 
But sometimes they stay the same or even improve over time 
The size of the prostate doesn t always determine how serious the symptoms are 
Some people with slightly enlarged prostates can have major symptoms 
Others who have very enlarged prostates can have minor problems 
And some people with enlarged prostates don t have any symptoms at all 
Narrowing of the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body 
Some medicines also may lead to symptoms that seem like those caused by BPH 
It s important to find out if there are any causes that could be treated 
Without treatment, the risk of a dangerous blockage of the urinary tract can rise 
If you can t pass any urine, get medical help right away 
When the prostate gets bigger, it starts to block urine flow 
The prostate is a gland that typically keeps growing throughout life 
This growth often enlarges the prostate enough to cause symptoms or to block urine flow 
It isn t clear what causes the prostate to get bigger 
Risk factors Risk factors for an enlarged prostate include 
An enlarged prostate gland rarely causes symptoms before age 
After that, the chance of having an enlarged prostate and related symptoms starts to rise 
Studies show that diabetes might raise the risk of BPH 
Complications Complications of an enlarged prostate can include 
Some people with an enlarged prostate need surgery to get relief 
If you often get UTIs, you might need surgery to remove part of the prostate 
These are most often caused by being unable to fully empty the bladder 
Bladder stones can cause illness, bladder irritation, blood in the urine and blocked urine flow 
A bladder that doesn t empty fully can stretch and weaken over time 
And this makes it harder to fully empty the bladder 
But urinary retention and kidney damage can be serious health threats 
Having an enlarged prostate is not thought to raise the risk of getting prostate cancer 
Overview IgA nephropathy nuh FROP uh thee , also known as Berger disease, is a kidney disease 
It happens when a germ fighting protein called immunoglobulin A IgA builds up in the kidneys 
But the course of the disease varies from person to person 
Some people leak blood into their urine without having other problems 
Others might have complications such as losing kidney function and spilling protein into the urine 
There s no cure for IgA nephropathy, but medicines can slow how quickly it becomes worse 
Such treatments may help the disease become not active, a state called remission 
Keeping blood pressure under control and lowering cholesterol also slow the disease 
You might not notice any health effects for years or more 
You might notice these color changes after a cold, sore throat or respiratory infection 
Pain on one or both sides of the back below the ribs 
If the disease leads to kidney failure, symptoms may include 
But dialysis or a kidney transplant can help people live for many more years 
It s key to get a checkup if you notice blood in your urine 
Also see your doctor if you notice sudden swelling in your hands or feet 
These vessels filter waste, extra water and other substances from the blood 
The waste products pass into the bladder and out of the body in urine 
Immunoglobulin A IgA is a type of protein called an antibody 
The immune system makes IgA to help attack germs and fight infections 
But with IgA nephropathy, this protein collects in the glomeruli 
This causes inflammation and affects their filtering ability over time 
Researchers don t know exactly what causes IgA to build up in the kidneys 
These include scarring of the liver called cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B and C infections 
Eating gluten, a protein found in most grains, triggers this digestive condition 
Risk factors The exact cause of IgA nephropathy is unknown 
But these factors might raise the risk of getting it 
IgA nephropathy most often develops between the mid teens and mid s 
Complications The course of IgA nephropathy varies from person to person 
Some people have the disease for years with few or no problems 
Other people develop one or more of the following complications 
Damage to the kidneys from IgA buildup can raise blood pressure 
And high blood pressure can do more damage to the kidneys 
High levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of a heart attack 
IgA nephropathy can cause the kidneys to stop working over time 
Then a treatment called dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to live 
This is a group of problems that can be caused by damage to the glomeruli 
Talk with your doctor if you have a family history of the disease 
Ask what you can do to keep your kidneys healthy 
For example, it helps to lower high blood pressure and keep cholesterol at healthy levels 
Bicuspid aortic valveBicuspid aortic valve is a heart problem present at birth 
Flaps of tissue on the valve open and close with each heartbeat 
Changes to the aortic valve can cause health problems, including 
Blood flow from the heart to the body is reduced or blocked 
An enlarged aorta increases the risk of a tear in the lining of the aorta 
SymptomsIf the bicuspid valve causes severe aortic stenosis or severe aortic regurgitation, symptoms may include 
DiagnosisA bicuspid aortic valve may be found when tests are done for another health problem 
The health care provider may hear a heart murmur when listening to the heart 
An echocardiogram can confirm a diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve 
This test uses sound waves to create videos of the beating heart 
It shows how blood moves through the heart chambers, the heart valves and the aorta 
Anyone with a bicuspid aortic valve needs regular health checkups and imaging tests 
The test also looks for changes in the size of the aorta 
Treatment for a bicuspid aortic valve depends on the severity of heart valve disease 
MedicationsThere are no medicines to repair a bicuspid aortic valve 
But medicines may be used to treat symptoms caused by heart valve disease 
Surgeries or other proceduresSurgery may be needed if a bicuspid aortic valve is causing 
Surgery is done to repair or replace the aortic valve 
The type of surgery done depends on the specific heart valve condition and your symptoms 
Sometimes, the aortic valve is replaced with the person s own lung valve 
The lung valve is replaced with a lung tissue valve from a deceased donor 
Surgeons remove the enlarged section of the aorta located near the heart 
It s replaced with a synthetic tube, called a graft, which is sewn into place 
Sometimes, only the enlarged section of the aorta is removed and the aortic valve remains 
The aortic valve also can be replaced or repaired during this procedure 
This heart valve procedure uses a thin, flexible tube called a catheter 
The surgeon inserts the catheter into an artery in the arm or groin 
Once in place, the balloon inflates, making the valve opening bigger 
Lifestyle and home remediesAnyone born with a bicuspid aortic valve needs health checkups for life 
A bicuspid aortic valve can be passed down in families, meaning it s inherited 
Bile ducts connect your liver to your gallbladder and to your small intestine 
Hilar cholangiocarcinoma occurs in the bile ducts just outside of the liver 
Distal cholangiocarcinoma occurs in the portion of the bile duct nearest the small intestine 
Cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed when it s advanced, making successful treatment difficult to achieve 
Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes jaundice 
Abdominal pain on the right side, just below the ribs 
He or she may refer you to a specialist in digestive diseases gastroenterologist 
Causes Cholangiocarcinoma happens when cells in the bile ducts develop changes in their DNA 
It s not clear what causes the changes that lead to cholangiocarcinoma 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of cholangiocarcinoma include 
This disease causes hardening and scarring of the bile ducts 
People who have type or diabetes may have an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma 
Examples of these conditions include cystic fibrosis and Lynch syndrome 
Chronic liver disease is associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma 
Some causes of liver disease can t be prevented, but others can 
Do what you can to take care of your liver 
SymptomsBile reflux can be difficult to distinguish from gastric acid reflux 
Bile is produced in your liver and stored in your gallbladder 
The valve normally opens just long enough to allow food to pass into the stomach 
But if the valve weakens or relaxes abnormally, bile can wash back into the esophagus 
What leads to bile reflux Bile reflux may be caused by 
Complications Bile reflux gastritis has been linked to stomach cancer 
The damaged esophageal cells have an increased risk of becoming cancerous 
Animal studies have also linked bile reflux to Barrett s esophagus 
In animal studies, bile reflux alone has been shown to cause cancer of the esophagus 
It always involves feeling like you re not able to stop eating 
It also often involves eating much larger than usual amounts of food 
Almost everyone overeats on occasion, such as having seconds or thirds of a holiday meal 
People who have binge eating disorder often feel embarrassed or ashamed about eating binges 
Feeling depressed, disgusted, ashamed, guilty or upset about your eating 
But restricting your diet may simply lead to more binge eating 
Talk with your healthcare professional or a mental health professional about your symptoms and feelings 
This is usually because of feelings of shame and embarrassment about the symptoms 
Hiding symptoms can make it hard for others to notice the problem 
Risk factors Binge eating disorder is more common in women than in men 
Factors that can raise your risk of having binge eating disorder include 
Many people with binge eating disorder have a history of dieting 
Dieting or limiting calories throughout the day may trigger an urge to binge eat 
Many people who have binge eating disorder feel negatively about themselves and their skills and accomplishments 
Triggers for bingeing can include stress, poor body self image and certain foods 
Complications Mental health conditions and physical problems can happen from binge eating 
Problems functioning at work, in your personal life or in social situations 
Mental health conditions that are often linked with binge eating disorder include 
The professional also can recommend helpful resources you can use to support your child 
Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year 
While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any 
In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling psychotherapy 
In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality psychosis 
Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar 
Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time 
Mania may also trigger a break from reality psychosis and require hospitalization 
Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms 
The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling 
In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons 
Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes 
When to get emergency helpSuicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder 
People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains 
The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes 
Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder 
Having a first degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder 
Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful 
Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity 
Addressing symptoms early on can prevent episodes from getting worse 
You may have identified a pattern to your bipolar episodes and what triggers them 
Call your doctor if you feel you re falling into an episode of depression or mania 
You may be tempted to stop treatment but don t 
Black color of the tongue, but the color may be brown, green, yellow or white 
Gagging or tickling feeling in your mouth, if the papillae are very large 
You re worried that it might be related to a health issue 
The cause of black hairy tongue can t always be found 
Changes in the healthy bacteria or yeast found in the mouth when taking antibiotics 
Eating a soft diet that doesn t help to rub dead skin cells from your tongue 
Regularly using mouthwashes that have oxidizing agents, such as peroxide, that can irritate your mouth 
Having a condition that lowers your ability to fight infections, such as cancer or HIV 
Bladder stones Overview Bladder stones are hard masses of minerals in your bladder 
They develop when the minerals in concentrated urine crystallize and form stones 
This often happens when you have trouble completely emptying your bladder 
Small bladder stones may pass without treatment, but sometimes bladder stones need medications or surgery 
Left untreated, bladder stones may lead to infections and other complications 
SymptomsSometimes bladder stones even large ones cause no problems 
Causes Bladder stones can develop when your bladder doesn t empty completely 
Any foreign materials present in the bladder tend to cause bladder stones 
An enlarged prostate benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH can cause bladder stones in men 
An enlarged prostate can obstruct the flow of urine, preventing the bladder from emptying completely 
Mineral crystals, which later become stones, tend to form on the surfaces of these devices 
Stones that form in your kidneys are not the same as bladder stones 
Risk factors Men, especially those over , are more likely to have bladder stones 
Conditions that can raise the risk of bladder stones include 
There are a number of causes, but the most common is an enlarged prostate 
It s possible to have nerve damage and a condition that causes bladder outlet obstruction 
Untreated bladder stones can cause long term urinary difficulties, such as pain or frequent urination 
Repeated bacterial infections in your urinary tract may be caused by bladder stones 
Ask your doctor what s an appropriate amount of fluid for you 
The bladder is a hollow muscular organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine 
Most bladder cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, when the cancer is highly treatable 
But even early stage bladder cancers can come back after successful treatment 
Causes Bladder cancer begins when cells in the bladder develop changes mutations in their DNA 
A cell s DNA contains instructions that tell the cell what to do 
The abnormal cells form a tumor that can invade and destroy normal body tissue 
In time, the abnormal cells can break away and spread metastasize through the body 
Types of bladder cancerDifferent types of cells in your bladder can become cancerous 
The type of bladder cell where cancer begins determines the type of bladder cancer 
Doctors use this information to determine which treatments may work best for you 
Urothelial cells expand when your bladder is full and contract when your bladder is empty 
Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer in the United States 
Squamous cell bladder cancer is rare in the United States 
Adenocarcinoma begins in cells that make up mucus secreting glands in the bladder 
Some bladder cancers include more than one type of cell 
Risk factors Factors that may increase bladder cancer risk include 
Men are more likely to develop bladder cancer than women are 
Treatment with the anti cancer drug cyclophosphamide increases the risk of bladder cancer 
If you ve had bladder cancer, you re more likely to get it again 
If you smoke, talk to your doctor about a plan to help you stop 
Support groups, medications and other methods may help you quit 
If you work with chemicals, follow all safety instructions to avoid exposure 
Choose a diet rich in a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables 
The antioxidants in fruits and vegetables may help reduce your risk of cancer 
If urinary incontinence affects your daily activities, don t hesitate to see your doctor 
Others may lose small to moderate amounts of urine more frequently 
You have a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine 
You may need to urinate often, including throughout the night 
A physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time 
When to see a doctorYou may feel uncomfortable discussing incontinence with your doctor 
Cause you to restrict your activities and limit your social interactions 
Increase the risk of falls in older adults as they rush to the toilet 
Causes Urinary incontinence can be caused by everyday habits, underlying medical conditions or physical problems 
A thorough evaluation by your doctor can help determine what s behind your incontinence 
Foods that are high in spice, sugar or acid, especially citrus fruits 
Urinary incontinence may also be caused by an easily treatable medical condition, such as 
The rectum is located near the bladder and shares many of the same nerves 
Hormonal changes and the increased weight of the fetus can lead to stress incontinence 
Aging of the bladder muscle can decrease the bladder s capacity to store urine 
Also, involuntary bladder contractions become more frequent as you get older 
In men, stress incontinence or urge incontinence can be associated with untreated prostate cancer 
But more often, incontinence is a side effect of treatments for prostate cancer 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing urinary incontinence include 
Pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and normal female anatomy account for this difference 
Neurological disease or diabetes may increase your risk of incontinence 
Rashes, skin infections and sores can develop from constantly wet skin 
Urinary incontinence can affect your social, work and personal relationships 
Avoid bladder irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol and acidic foods 
Eat more fiber, which can prevent constipation, a cause of urinary incontinence 
Don t smoke, or seek help to quit if you re a smoker 
The exposed bladder can t store urine or function normally, resulting in urine leakage incontinence 
Bladder exstrophy may be spotted on a routine ultrasound during pregnancy 
Sometimes, though, the defect isn t visible until the baby is born 
Babies born with bladder exstrophy will need surgery to correct the defects 
This defect causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body 
Cloacal exstrophy kloe A kul EK stroh fee is the most serious form of BEEC 
In this condition, the rectum, bladder and genitals don t fully separate as the fetus develops 
These organs may not be correctly formed, and the pelvic bones are affected as well 
The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected 
Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal abnormalities, including spina bifida 
Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy 
Researchers think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors likely plays a role 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of bladder exstrophy include 
Bladder exstrophy is more common in whites than in other races 
They re also at risk of sexual dysfunction and have an increased risk of bladder cancer 
The success of surgery depends on how severe the defect is 
Many children who have surgical repair are able to hold urine 
Overview Cystitis sis TIE tis is the medical term for inflammation of the bladder 
Inflammation is when a part of your body is swollen and hot 
Most of the time, cystitis happens when there s an infection caused by bacteria 
It can become a serious health problem if the infection spreads to your kidneys 
Cystitis also may occur as a reaction to certain drugs or radiation therapy 
Cystitis can also happen as a complication of another illness 
The usual treatment for cystitis caused by bacteria is to take antibiotic medication 
Treatment for other types of cystitis depends on the cause 
A feeling of pressure in the area below your belly button abdomen 
Nighttime bed wetting on its own isn t likely to happen because of a UTI 
Also call your provider if cystitis symptoms come back after you re done with antibiotic treatment 
You may need to try a different type of medicine 
If your child starts having daytime wetting accidents, call your child s health care provider 
Any symptoms should be checked by a health care provider 
Causes Your urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra 
All play a role in removing waste from your body 
They filter waste from your blood and regulate the concentrations of many substances 
Tubes called ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder 
The bladder stores the urine until you feel the need to urinate 
Most cases of cystitis are caused by a type of Escherichia coli E coli bacteria 
The cause of this chronic bladder inflammation, also called painful bladder syndrome, is not clear 
Radiation treatment of the pelvic area can cause inflammatory changes in bladder tissue 
Long term use of a catheter can make bacterial infections and tissue damage more likely 
Some people may be extra sensitive to chemicals found in certain products 
These might include bubble bath, personal hygiene spray or spermicidal jelly 
An allergic type reaction can happen within the bladder, causing inflammation 
You may be at greater risk of bladder infections or repeated UTIs 
Hormone changes during pregnancy may increase the risk of a bladder infection 
Changes to hormones that happen after menopause often can lead to UTIs 
This can happen with certain conditions, such as diabetes, HIV infection and cancer treatment 
These tubes may be needed in people with chronic illnesses or in older adults 
Complications When treated right away with the proper medicine, bladder infections rarely lead to complications 
But if they aren t treated, they can become something more serious 
An untreated bladder infection can lead to a kidney infection 
With cystitis, you may have blood cells in the urine 
Blood in the urine that you can see is called gross hematuria 
PreventionSelf care measures to prevent repeated bladder infections aren t well studied 
If you feel the urge to urinate, don t delay using the toilet 
This prevents bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra 
If you re prone to infections, showering rather than taking a bath may help prevent them 
Do this daily, but don t use harsh soaps or wash too vigorously 
Drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria 
Avoid using deodorant sprays or hygiene products in the genital area 
Cranberry products are generally considered to be safe in healthy people without any medical conditions 
The condition is a part of a spectrum of diseases known as painful bladder syndrome 
Your bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine 
Although there s no cure, medications and other therapies may offer relief 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms of interstitial cystitis vary from person to person 
Pain in your pelvis or between the vagina and anus in women 
Pain or discomfort while the bladder fills and relief after urinating 
Symptoms severity is different for everyone, and some people may experience symptom free periods 
However, symptoms may worsen if a person with interstitial cystitis gets a urinary tract infection 
Other possible but unproven contributing factors include an autoimmune reaction, heredity, infection or allergy 
Risk factors These factors are associated with a higher risk of interstitial cystitis 
Women are diagnosed with interstitial cystitis more often than men 
Most people with interstitial cystitis are diagnosed during their s or older 
Complications Interstitial cystitis can result in a number of complications, including 
Frequent urination and pain may strain your personal relationships, and sexual intimacy may suffer 
Blastocystis hominis Overview Blastocystis is a microscopic parasite that can live in your digestive tract 
Researchers don t fully understand the role blastocystis plays, if any, in causing disease 
Most commonly, however, blastocystis organisms simply live in a person s digestive tract without causing harm 
Blastocystis in humans was once identified as a single species, Blastocystis hominis 
Researchers have found several variations either different species or different strains within a species 
The scientific name used now is Blastocystis spp, an abbreviation that means multiple species 
Some types of blastocystis may be more likely to cause disease than others 
Disease may be caused by other organisms that coexist with Blastocystis 
Blastocystis can be passed between people and from animals to people 
Are exposed to human feces at work, such as a children s day care 
Complications If you have diarrhea associated with blastocystis, it s likely to be self limiting 
PreventionThe best practice for preventing blastocystis infection is practicing good hygiene 
Handwashing tipsWash your hands often with soap and water for at least seconds 
After changing a diaper or helping a child use the toilet 
After helping a person who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea 
A general guideline is to avoid eating what you can t boil, cook or peel 
Food at room temperature, such as sauces and buffet offerings 
Make sure hot beverages, such as coffee or tea, are steaming hot 
Drink bottled beverages from original, unopened containers after cleaning them 
Blepharitis usually affects both eyes along the edges of the eyelids 
Blepharitis is often a chronic condition that s difficult to treat 
But it usually doesn t cause permanent damage to your eyesight, and it s not contagious 
SymptomsBlepharitis signs and symptoms are typically worse in the morning 
It might be associated with one or more of the following 
Allergies, including allergic reactions to eye medications, contact lens solutions or eye makeup 
Blepharitis can cause your eyelashes to fall out, grow abnormally misdirected eyelashes or lose color 
This can irritate your eyes and cause symptoms of dry eyes or excess tearing 
A stye is an infection that develops near the base of the eyelashes 
The result is a painful lump on the edge of your eyelid 
A stye is usually most visible on the surface of the eyelid 
This blockage causes inflammation of the gland, which makes the eyelid swell and redden 
This can clear up or turn into a hard, nontender bump 
Blepharitis can lead to recurrent bouts of pink eye conjunctivitis 
Not having enough tears could increase your risk of a corneal infection 
Blocked tear duct Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The condition is caused by a partial or complete obstruction in the tear drainage system 
The condition usually gets better without any treatment during the first year of life 
Treatment depends on the cause of the blockage and the age of the affected person 
Mucus or pus discharge from the lids and surface of the eye 
Early identification of the tumor can give you more treatment options 
Causes Blocked tear ducts can happen at any age, from birth to adulthood 
A tumor in the nose or anywhere along the tear drainage system can cause blockage 
How the tear drainage system worksThe lacrimal glands produce most of your tears 
These glands are located inside the upper lids above each eye 
Typically, tears flow from the lacrimal glands over the surface of your eye 
From there tears travel down the nasolacrimal duct and drain into your nose 
Risk factors Certain factors increase your risk of developing a blocked tear duct 
Older adults are at increased risk of developing blocked tear ducts due to age related changes 
Follow these tips to avoid eye infections in the first place 
Pain so severe that you can t sit still or find a comfortable position 
This common condition, which is congenital, causes two ureters to form on the same kidney 
The second ureter can be fully or only partially developed 
A blockage obstruction where the ureter connects to the kidney or bladder 
This rare disorder occurs when fibrous tissue grows in the area behind the abdomen 
The fibers encircle and block the ureters, causing urine to back up into the kidneys 
Overview It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria 
But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness 
If you can see the blood, it s called gross hematuria 
Blood that can t be seen with the naked eye is called microscopic hematuria 
Either way, it s important to figure out the reason for the bleeding 
SymptomsBlood in the urine can look pink, red or cola colored 
It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red 
But if blood clots get passed in the urine, that can hurt 
Certain foods also can turn urine red, including beets and rhubarb 
UTIs can cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown 
Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream 
Kidney infections can cause the same urine related symptoms that other UTIs can 
The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder 
It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine 
Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms 
Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes 
These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better 
The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see 
The anti cancer drug cyclophosphamide Cytoxan and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine 
Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine 
Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause 
Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football 
It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit 
It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don t involve an injury 
If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don t assume it s from exercising 
Risk factors Almost anyone can have red blood cells in the urine 
Some things that can raise the risk of blood in the urine include 
Some pain relievers, blood thinners and antibiotics can raise the risk of blood in urine 
Burning mouth syndrome usually comes on suddenly, but it can develop slowly over time 
Taste changes in your mouth, such as a bitter or metallic taste 
The discomfort from burning mouth syndrome can have several different patterns 
Start as soon as you wake up and last all day 
In rare cases, symptoms may suddenly go away on their own or happen less often 
Sometimes the burning feeling may be briefly relieved during eating or drinking 
Causes The cause of burning mouth syndrome may be primary or secondary 
Secondary burning mouth syndromeSometimes burning mouth syndrome is caused by an underlying medical condition 
Underlying problems that may be linked to secondary burning mouth syndrome include 
Endocrine disorders, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid known as hypothyroidism 
Dentures that don t fit well may cause irritation that can make symptoms worse 
Burning mouth syndrome usually starts suddenly, for no known reason 
But certain factors may increase your risk of developing burning mouth syndrome, including 
Some long term medical conditions such as fibromyalgia, Parkinson s disease, autoimmune disorders and neuropathy 
Long term cases involving a lot of discomfort also could lead to anxiety or depression 
Or these measures may prevent your discomfort from feeling worse 
Body lice Overview Body lice are tiny insects, about the size of a sesame seed 
They can also spread from contact with an infected person s clothes 
Body lice bites can spread certain types of diseases and can even cause epidemics 
Causes Body lice are similar to head lice but have different habits 
They travel to your skin several times a day to feed on blood 
Dogs, cats and other pets do not spread body lice 
However, a body lice infestation sometimes leads to complications such as 
If you scratch to relieve itching, this also can irritate your skin 
If your skin becomes raw from these irritations, other infections may develop 
Sweating and body odor Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
They re also common when you re feeling nervous, anxious or stressed 
Changes in body odor also may signal a health problem 
Otherwise, lifestyle and home treatments can usually help with normal sweating and body odor 
SymptomsSome people naturally sweat more or less than other people 
You suddenly begin to sweat much more or less than usual 
Causes Sweating and body odor are caused by sweat glands in your body 
The two main types of sweat glands are eccrine glands and apocrine glands 
This fluid is odorless until it combines with bacteria on your skin 
Boils and carbuncles Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Boils furuncles usually start as reddish or purplish, tender bumps 
You can usually care for a single boil at home 
But don t attempt to prick or squeeze it that may spread the infection 
Development of a yellow white tip that eventually ruptures and allows the pus to drain out 
CarbunclesA carbuncle is a cluster of boils that form a connected area of infection 
When to see a doctorYou usually can care for a single, small boil yourself 
Close contact with a person who has a staph infection 
But the following measures may help you avoid staph infections 
Keep cuts and abrasions clean and covered with sterile, dry bandages until they heal 
Don t share towels, sheets, razors, clothing, athletic equipment and other personal items 
Staph infections can spread via objects, as well as from person to person 
Bone cancer is rare, making up less than percent of all cancers 
In fact, noncancerous bone tumors are much more common than cancerous ones 
Some types of bone cancer occur primarily in children, while others affect mostly adults 
In rare circumstances, osteosarcomas can arise outside of bones extraskeletal osteosarcomas 
Chondrosarcoma is the second most common form of bone cancer 
Chondrosarcoma usually occurs in the pelvis, legs or arms in middle aged and older adults 
Infections can reach a bone by traveling through the bloodstream or spreading from nearby tissue 
People who have diabetes may develop osteomyelitis in their feet if they have foot ulcers 
Although once considered incurable, osteomyelitis can now be successfully treated 
Most people need surgery to remove areas of the bone that have died 
Swelling, warmth and redness over the area of the infection 
Germs can enter a bone in a variety of ways, including 
Severe puncture wounds can carry germs deep inside your body 
If such an injury becomes infected, the germs can spread into a nearby bone 
Direct contamination with germs can occur during surgeries to replace joints or repair fractures 
Other factors that can make your bones more vulnerable to osteomyelitis may include 
Examples of when this type of tubing might be used include 
Needing to take corticosteroids or drugs called tumor necrosis factor inhibitors 
Areas where bone has died need to be surgically removed for antibiotics to be effective 
Sometimes, infection within bones can spread into a nearby joint 
Reducing your risk of infection will also help your risk of developing osteomyelitis 
Nearly all types of cancer can spread metastasize to the bones 
With rare exceptions, cancer that has spread to the bones can t be cured 
Treatments can help reduce pain and other symptoms of bone metastases 
When it does occur, signs and symptoms of bone metastasis include 
Overview Bone spurs are bony growths that form along bone edges 
Bone spurs often form where bones meet each other in the joints 
They also can form on the bones of the spine 
But sometimes, bone spurs can cause pain and loss of motion in your joints 
Bone spurs in the knee can make it painful to extend and bend the leg 
These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots 
That can cause weakness or numbness in the arms or legs 
Bone spurs can make it painful to move the hip 
Sometimes, it might feel like the pain is in the knee or the thigh 
When to see a doctorGet a healthcare checkup if you have 
Weakness or loss of feeling in the arms or legs 
Causes Joint damage from osteoarthritis is the most common cause of bone spurs 
Osteoarthritis breaks down connective tissue called cartilage that cushions the ends of bones 
Risk factors The risk of bone spurs is higher in people who have arthritis 
Impulsiveness involves having extreme emotions and acting or doing things without thinking about them first 
People with borderline personality disorder have a strong fear of abandonment or being left alone 
It also leads to impulsiveness and self injury that may push others away 
Mood swings, anger and impulsiveness often get better with age 
SymptomsBorderline personality disorder affects how you feel about yourself, relate to others and behave 
Periods of stress related paranoia and loss of contact with reality 
These periods can last from a few minutes to a few hours 
Threats of suicide or self injury, often in response to fears of separation or rejection 
Wide mood swings that last from a few hours to a few days 
Call your mental health professional, doctor or another member of your healthcare team 
Reach out to a loved one, close friend, trusted peer or co worker 
Many people with the condition report being sexually or physically abused or neglected during childhood 
Others have been exposed to hostile conflict and unstable family relationships 
Complications Borderline personality disorder can damage many areas of your life 
It can negatively affect close relationships, jobs, school, social activities and how you see yourself 
Injuring yourself, such as by cutting or burning, and frequent stays in the hospital 
Also, you may have other mental health conditions, such as 
A type of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum produces the toxin 
Botulism can occur as the result of food or wound contamination 
The condition can also occur when bacterial spores grow in the intestines of infants 
In rare cases, botulism can also be caused by medical treatment or bioterrorism 
It typically occurs in babies between the ages of months and months 
In rare cases, this form of intestinal botulism also affects adults 
Occasionally, botulism happens when too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons 
The term iatrogenic means an illness caused by medical exam or treatment 
Another rare form of botulism can occur from inhaling toxins 
All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies 
Wound botulismSymptoms of wound botulism appear about days after the toxin enters your body 
Infant botulismProblems generally begin to hours after the toxin enters the baby s body 
Floppy movements due to muscle weakness and trouble controlling the head 
When to see a doctorSeek urgent medical care if you suspect that you have botulism 
Initial treatment increases your survival chances and lowers your risk of complications 
Getting medical care quickly can also alert public health officials about episodes of foodborne botulism 
They may be able to keep other people from eating contaminated food 
Keep in mind, though, that botulism can t spread from person to person 
Wound botulismWhen C botulinum bacteria get into a wound, they can multiply and make toxin 
Or the wound may be caused by a traumatic injury or surgery 
In some cases, the source of infant botulism may be honey 
But it s more likely to be exposure to soil contaminated with the bacteria 
Complications Because it affects muscle control throughout your body, botulinum toxin can cause many complications 
The most immediate danger is that you won t be able to breathe 
Being unable to breathe is a common cause of death in botulism 
Think about boiling these foods for minutes before serving them 
Don t eat preserved food if its container is bulging or if the food smells bad 
But, taste and smell won t always give away the presence of C botulinum 
Some strains don t make food smell bad or taste unusual 
If you wrap potatoes in foil before baking, eat them hot 
Loosen the foil and store the potatoes in the refrigerator not at room temperature 
Store homemade oils infused with garlic or herbs in the refrigerator 
If you think a wound is infected, seek medical treatment right away 
Overview Fecal incontinence is not being able to control bowel movements 
Common causes of fecal incontinence include diarrhea, constipation, and muscle or nerve damage 
The muscle or nerve damage may be associated with aging or with giving birth 
Whatever the cause, fecal incontinence can be difficult to discuss 
But don t shy away from talking to your doctor about this common problem 
Treatments can improve fecal incontinence and your quality of life 
SymptomsFecal incontinence may occur during an occasional bout of diarrhea 
People with this condition may not be able to stop the urge to defecate 
Fecal incontinence may happen with other bowel problems, such as 
This is especially important if it happens a lot, is severe or causes emotional distress 
Often, people are too embarrassed to tell a provider about fecal incontinence 
But the sooner you re evaluated, the sooner you may find some relief from your symptoms 
Causes For many people, there is more than one cause of fecal incontinence 
This is most commonly due to having an episiotomy or using forceps during delivery 
The muscles of the rectum and intestines stretch and eventually weaken 
Long lasting constipation also may cause nerve damage that leads to fecal incontinence 
These swollen veins can keep the anus from closing completely, letting stool leak out 
The longer this lasts, the less likely the nerves and muscles will recover 
In women, fecal incontinence can occur if the rectum protrudes through the vagina 
Although fecal incontinence can occur at any age, it s more common in adults over 
Fecal incontinence is often present in late stage Alzheimer s disease and dementia 
Being physically disabled may make it difficult to reach a toilet in time 
Losing control over bodily functions can lead to feeling uneasy about being out in public 
Repeated contact with stool can lead to pain and itching 
PreventionDepending on the cause, it may be possible to improve or prevent fecal incontinence 
Increase your exercise, eat more high fiber foods and drink plenty of fluids 
Straining during bowel movements can eventually weaken anal sphincter muscles or damage nerves 
Without treatment, the blocked parts of the intestine can die, leading to serious problems 
However, with prompt medical care, intestinal obstruction often can be successfully treated 
Causes The most common causes of intestinal obstruction in adults are 
Hernias portions of intestine that protrude into another part of your body 
Certain medications that affect muscles and nerves, including antidepressants and opioids 
Risk factors Diseases and conditions that can increase your risk of intestinal obstruction include 
Abdominal or pelvic surgery, which often causes adhesions a common intestinal obstruction 
Crohn s disease, which can cause the intestine s walls to thicken, narrowing the passageway 
Complications Untreated, intestinal obstruction can cause serious, life threatening complications, including 
Intestinal obstruction can cut off the blood supply to part of your intestine 
Peritonitis is the medical term for infection in the abdominal cavity 
It s a life threatening condition that requires immediate medical and often surgical attention 
Other conditions, such as inflammation or tumors, may affect the brachial plexus 
The most severe brachial plexus injuries usually result from automobile or motorcycle accidents 
Severe brachial plexus injuries can leave the arm paralyzed, but surgery may help restore function 
These are called stingers or burners, and can produce the following symptoms 
A feeling like an electric shock or a burning sensation shooting down the arm 
Weakness or inability to use certain muscles in the hand, arm or shoulder 
Complete lack of movement and feeling in the arm, including the shoulder and hand 
When to see a doctorBrachial plexus injuries can cause permanent weakness or disability 
Even if yours seems minor, you may need medical care 
These may be associated with high birth weight, breech presentation or prolonged labor 
Most often, the upper nerves are injured, a condition called Erb s palsy 
Radiation treatment to the chest may cause damage to the brachial plexus 
But some injuries can cause temporary or permanent problems, such as 
If you experience paralysis of the hand or arm, the joints can stiffen 
This can make movement difficult, even if you eventually regain use of the limb 
For that reason, your provider is likely to recommend ongoing physical therapy during your recovery 
Nerves regrow slowly and can take several years to heal after injury 
During that time, lack of use may cause the affected muscles to break down 
Even with surgery, some people experience permanent muscle weakness or paralysis 
Avoid burns or cuts, as you may not feel them if you re experiencing numbness 
The hearts of adults at rest usually beat between and times a minute 
If you have bradycardia, your heart beats fewer than times a minute 
If this happens, you may feel dizzy, very tired or weak, and short of breath 
When to see a doctorMany things can cause signs and symptoms of bradycardia 
It s important to get a prompt, accurate diagnosis and appropriate care 
See your health care provider if you are concerned about a slow heart rate 
Damage to heart tissues from heart disease or heart attack 
Imbalance of chemicals in the blood, such as potassium or calcium 
Bradycardia occurs when these signals slow down or are blocked 
Sinus node problemsBradycardia often starts in the area of the heart called the sinus node 
In some people, sinus node problems cause alternating slow and fast heart rates bradycardia tachycardia syndrome 
If this occurs, the condition is called heart block, or atrioventricular block 
Some beats are dropped, resulting in a slower and sometimes irregular heart rhythm 
None of the electrical signals from the atria reaches the ventricles 
Anything that increases the risk of heart problems can increase the risk of bradycardia 
Healthy lifestyle changes or medical treatment may help lower the risk of heart disease 
Inability of the heart to pump enough blood heart failure 
Choose a healthy, low fat, low salt, low sugar diet that s rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
Have regular physical exams and report signs or symptoms to your health care provider 
Sick sinus syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Sick sinus syndrome Overview Sick sinus syndrome is a type of heart rhythm disorder 
It affects the heart s natural pacemaker sinus node , which controls the heartbeat 
Sick sinus syndrome may also be called sinus node dysfunction or sinus node disease 
SymptomsMost people with sick sinus syndrome have few or no symptoms 
Typically, the sinus node creates a steady pace of electrical impulses 
The pace changes depending on activity, emotions and other factors 
In sick sinus syndrome, the electrical signals are irregularly paced 
Sick sinus syndrome is relatively uncommon, but the risk of developing it increases with age 
Damage to the sinus node or scarring from heart surgery 
Medications to treat high blood pressure, including calcium channel blockers and beta blockers 
Signals to the upper heart chambers are slowed or blocked, causing pauses or skipped beats 
Risk factors Sick sinus syndrome can occur at any age 
It s most common in people in their s or older 
Common heart disease risk factors might increase the risk of sick sinus syndrome 
The arteries take oxygen rich blood from the heart to the brain 
Veins carry the oxygen depleted blood back to the lungs and heart 
Most people are born with them, but they can form later in life 
Some people with a brain AVM experience signs and symptoms, such as headaches or seizures 
In about half of all brain AVMs, hemorrhage is the first sign 
Muscle weakness or numbness in one part of the body 
The effects slowly build and often cause symptoms in early adulthood 
One severe type of brain AVM involves the vein of Galen 
It causes signs and symptoms that emerge soon or immediately after birth 
A bleeding brain AVM is life threatening and requires emergency medical attention 
Typically, the heart sends oxygen rich blood to the brain through arteries 
The capillaries slowly deliver oxygen through their thin, porous walls to the surrounding brain tissue 
This may result in the AVM rupturing and bleeding into the brain 
This risk of a brain AVM bleeding ranges from around to each year 
Brain AVMs account for about of all hemorrhagic strokes each year 
They re often the cause of hemorrhage in children and young adults who experience brain hemorrhage 
Surrounding brain tissue can t easily absorb oxygen from the fast flowing blood 
Without enough oxygen, brain tissues weaken or may die off completely 
An AVM puts extreme pressure on the thin and weak walls of the blood vessels 
A bulge in a blood vessel wall aneurysm may develop and become susceptible to rupture 
The body may recruit more arteries to supply blood to the fast flowing brain AVM 
This may prevent protective fluids from flowing freely around the hemispheres of the brain 
If fluid builds up, it can push brain tissue up against the skull 
Overview Brain metastases occur when cancer cells spread from their original site to the brain 
Brain metastases may form one tumor or many tumors in the brain 
This causes signs and symptoms, such as headache, personality changes, memory loss and seizures 
Treatment is often focused on reducing pain and symptoms resulting from the cancer 
Causes Brain metastases occur when cancer cells break away from their original location 
Overview A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain or near it 
Sometimes, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body 
These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors 
These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors 
Noncancerous brain tumors may grow over time and press on the brain tissue 
Other brain tumors are brain cancers, also called malignant brain tumors 
The cancer cells can invade and destroy the brain tissue 
Brain tumors range in size from very small to very large 
Some parts of the brain are less active than others 
The brain tumor size could become quite large before the tumor is detected 
Special lab tests on the tumor cells can give information about the cells 
Your health care team uses this information to figure out the type of brain tumor 
These types are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors 
Gliomas are growths of cells that look like glial cells 
The glial cells surround and support nerve cells in the brain tissue 
Types of gliomas and related brain tumors include astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma and ependymoma 
Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain tumor 
Choroid plexus tumors are located in the fluid filled cavities in the brain, called the ventricles 
Choroid plexus carcinoma is the malignant form of this type of brain tumor 
Embryonal tumors begin in cells that are left over from fetal development 
The cells, called embryonal cells, stay in the brain after birth 
Embryonal tumors are malignant brain tumors that happen most often in babies and young children 
It s usually located in the lower back part of the brain, called the cerebellum 
But sometimes they re in other parts of the body, including the brain 
Pineal tumors start in and around the brain s pineal gland 
The pineal gland is located in the center of the brain 
It makes a hormone called melatonin that helps with sleep 
Pineoblastoma is a malignant type of pineal tumor that s most common in children 
Meningiomas are brain tumors that start in the membranes around the brain and spinal cord 
Meningiomas are usually benign, but sometimes they can be malignant 
Meningiomas are the most common type of benign brain tumor 
Nerve tumors are growths that happen in and around nerves 
The most common type that happens in the head is acoustic neuroma, also called schwannoma 
Brain tumors can begin in and around the pituitary gland 
This small gland is located near the base of the brain 
Most tumors that happen in and around the pituitary gland are benign 
Craniopharyngioma is a type of brain tumor that happens near the pituitary gland 
Many other types of rare tumors can happen in and around the brain 
Tumors can start in the muscles, blood vessels and connective tissue around the brain 
Malignant brain tumors can start from the germ fighting immune system cells in the brain 
This type of brain cancer is called primary central nervous system lymphoma 
General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include 
Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning 
Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines 
Losing feeling or movement in an arm or a leg 
Dizziness or a sense that the world is spinning, also called vertigo 
Brain tumors that aren t cancerous tend to cause symptoms that develop slowly 
They might cause subtle symptoms that you don t notice at first 
Cancerous brain tumors also are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors 
They get worse in a matter of days or weeks 
Brain tumor headachesHeadaches are the most common symptom of brain tumors 
Headaches happen in about half of people with brain tumors 
Headaches can happen if a growing brain tumor presses on healthy cells around it 
Brain tumor headaches tend to cause pain that s worse when coughing or straining 
People with brain tumors most often report that the headache feels like a tension headache 
Brain tumors in the back of the head might cause a headache with neck pain 
Brain tumor symptoms by locationThe main part of the brain is called the cerebrum 
Brain tumors in different parts of the cerebrum might cause different symptoms 
The frontal lobes are in the front of the brain 
Frontal lobe brain tumors might cause balance problems and trouble walking 
There might be personality changes, such as forgetfulness and lack of interest in usual activities 
Sometimes family members notice that the person with the brain tumor seems different 
The parietal lobes are in the upper middle part of the brain 
They help process information about touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing 
Parietal lobe brain tumors can cause problems related to the senses 
The occipital lobes are in the back of the brain 
The temporal lobes are on the sides of the brain 
They might cause someone to see, taste or smell something that isn t there 
They might start right in the brain or in the tissue nearby 
Nearby tissue might include the membranes that cover the brain, called meninges 
Brain tumors also can happen in nerves, the pituitary gland and the pineal gland 
Brain tumors happen when cells in or near the brain get changes in their DNA 
A cell s DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do 
This makes a lot of extra cells in the brain 
It s not clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to brain tumors 
For many people with brain tumors, the cause is never known 
The changes can increase the risk of having a brain tumor 
When brain tumors happen in children, they re likely to be primary brain tumors 
Any cancer can spread to the brain, but common types include 
Secondary brain tumors most often happen in people who have a history of cancer 
In adults, secondary brain tumors are far more common than are primary brain tumors 
In most people with primary brain tumors, the cause isn t clear 
But doctors have identified some factors that may raise the risk 
Brain tumors can happen at any age, but they happen most often in older adults 
But some types of brain tumors are more common in people of certain races 
The radiation is strong enough to cause DNA changes in the body s cells 
Low level radiation from everyday objects isn t linked to brain tumors 
Low levels of radiation include the energy that comes from cellphones and radio waves 
There is no convincing evidence that using cellphones causes brain tumors 
Some DNA changes that increase the risk of brain tumor run in families 
If you get a brain tumor, you didn t do anything to cause it 
People with an increased risk of brain tumor might consider screening tests 
This person can help you understand your risk and ways to manage it 
The growths, called tumors, can grow to press on nearby parts of the brain 
The type of brain tumor a child has helps determine the best treatment plan 
SymptomsPediatric brain tumor symptoms may vary depending on the tumor s location within the brain 
Symptoms also might depend on the size of the tumor and how quickly it s growing 
Some of the more common signs and symptoms of pediatric brain tumors include 
Seizures, especially in a child who hasn t had a seizure before 
Weakness or loss of sensation in an arm or a leg 
Causes Most of the time, the cause of a pediatric brain tumor isn t known 
Pediatric brain tumors start when cells in the brain develop changes in their DNA 
The changes tell the tumor cells to make many more cells quickly 
Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die 
The extra cells might form a mass called a tumor 
A tumor can grow and press on nearby brain tissue 
Sometimes a growing tumor causes swelling and other changes in the nearby brain tissue 
Some tumor cells develop other DNA changes that turn them into cancer cells 
Sometimes cancer cells can break away and spread beyond the brain 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of pediatric brain tumors include 
In children, brain tumors tend to happen more often in those younger than 
Certain medical conditions, such as infection with HIV, can weaken the immune system 
Tests of your child s DNA can show whether these syndromes are present 
If your child develops a brain tumor, you didn t do anything to cause it 
Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer 
And the number of people dying of breast cancer is steadily going down 
Advances in breast cancer screening allow healthcare professionals to diagnose breast cancer earlier 
Finding the cancer earlier makes it much more likely that the cancer can be cured 
Even when breast cancer can t be cured, many treatments exist to extend life 
A breast lump or thickened area of skin that feels different from the surrounding tissue 
In people with white skin, the breast skin may look pink or red 
Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast 
Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the skin on the breast 
Causes The exact cause of most breast cancers isn t known 
Researchers have found things that increase the risk of breast cancer 
These include hormones, lifestyle choices and things in the environment 
These ducts are tubes designed to carry milk to the nipple 
Breast cancer that starts in the ducts is called invasive ductal carcinoma 
Breast cancer also can start in cells in the milk glands 
These glands, called lobules, are designed to make breast milk 
Cancer that happens in the lobules is called invasive lobular carcinoma 
Other cells in the breast can become cancer cells, though this isn t common 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of breast cancer include 
The risk also is higher if you have multiple family members with breast cancer 
Still, most people diagnosed with breast cancer don t have a family history of the disease 
Certain breast conditions are markers for a higher risk of breast cancer 
Beginning your period before age increases your risk of breast cancer 
Beginning menopause after age increases the risk of breast cancer 
Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer 
Breast tissue is made up of fatty tissue and dense tissue 
Dense tissue is made of milk glands, milk ducts and fibrous tissue 
Having dense breasts can make it harder to detect breast cancer on a mammogram 
Having been pregnant one or more times lowers the risk of breast cancer 
The risk of breast cancer goes up as you get older 
The risk is linked to hormone therapy medicines that combine estrogen and progesterone 
The risk goes down when you stop taking these medicines 
People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer 
Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening 
Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you 
Become familiar with your breasts through breast self exam for breast awareness 
But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts 
This might make it more likely that you ll notice if something changes 
For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol 
Aim for at least minutes of exercise on most days of the week 
Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer 
Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy 
If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight 
Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of exercise 
You might have a high risk if you have a family history of breast cancer 
Your team might have options for lowering your risk, such as 
Options include medicines called selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors 
These medicines also are used as hormone therapy treatment for breast cancer 
One option might be surgery to remove the breasts, called prophylactic mastectomy 
Another option is surgery to remove the ovaries, called prophylactic oophorectomy 
This operation lowers the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer 
Inflammatory breast cancer happens when a growth of cells forms in the breast tissue 
This skin on the breast might look red or purple 
Seek medical attention right away if you notice skin changes on your breast 
Fast change in the appearance of one breast, over the course of several weeks 
Changes in skin color, giving the breast a red, purple, pink or bruised appearance 
Dimpling or ridges on the skin of the affected breast, similar to an orange peel 
Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone or below the collarbone 
Flattened nipple or nipple that turns inward on the affected breast 
Other, more common conditions have symptoms similar to those of inflammatory breast cancer 
It s reasonable and common to first be treated with antibiotics for a week or more 
If your symptoms respond to antibiotics, additional testing isn t necessary 
You may have a mammogram or other test to evaluate your symptoms 
Causes Inflammatory breast cancer happens when cells in the breast develop changes in their DNA 
In inflammatory breast cancer, the cancer cells break away from where they started 
They travel to the lymphatic vessels in the breast skin 
The blockage in the lymphatic vessels causes skin color changes, swelling and dimpled skin 
This skin is a classic sign of inflammatory breast cancer 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of inflammatory breast cancer include 
Being youngerInflammatory breast cancer is more frequently diagnosed in people in their s and s 
Being BlackBlack people have a higher risk of inflammatory breast cancer than do white people 
Being obesePeople who are obese have a greater risk of inflammatory breast cancer 
PreventionMaking changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of breast cancer 
Limit hormone therapy during menopauseCombination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer 
These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable to get relief 
Maintain a healthy weightIf your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight 
Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount you exercise 
Breast cancer is typically thought of as a condition that happens in women 
It happens most often in older men, though it can occur at any age 
Treatment for male breast cancer typically involves surgery to remove the breast tissue 
Other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be recommended as well 
A painless lump or thickening of the skin on the chest 
Male breast cancer starts when cells in the breast tissue develop changes in their DNA 
Where breast cancer begins in menEveryone is born with a small amount of breast tissue 
Breast tissue consists of milk producing glands, ducts that carry milk to the nipples and fat 
During puberty, people assigned female at birth typically begin growing more breast tissue 
People assigned male at birth generally do not grow more breast tissue 
Cancer that begins in the milk ducts, called ductal carcinoma 
This type of breast cancer starts in the tubes that connect to the nipple 
Ductal carcinoma is the most common type of male breast cancer 
Cancer that begins in the milk producing glands, called lobular carcinoma 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of male breast cancer include 
Male breast cancer is most often diagnosed in men in their s 
People born with these DNA changes have a greater risk of breast cancer 
For example, the DNA changes BRCA and BRCA increase the risk of male breast cancer 
Obesity is linked with higher levels of estrogen in the body 
PreventionFor most men, there s no way to prevent male breast cancer 
DNA changes that increase the risk of male breast cancer include BRCA and BRCA 
Usually this involves becoming familiar with the skin and tissue on your chest 
You also might have an annual exam of your chest 
In general, follow the screening guidelines for people assigned female at birth 
Often a small amount of breast tissue remains after surgery 
Get to know the look and feel of the skin on your chest 
Report any changes to your health care team right away 
Breast cysts don t require treatment unless a cyst is large and painful or uncomfortable 
In that case, draining the fluid from a breast cyst can ease symptoms 
Breast cysts also commonly occur in postmenopausal women who take hormone therapy 
SymptomsBreast cysts may be found in one or both breasts 
Nipple discharge that may be clear, yellow, straw colored or dark brown 
Breast pain or tenderness in the area of the breast lump 
An increase in breast lump size and breast tenderness just before your period 
A decrease in breast lump size and resolution of other symptoms after your period 
Having breast cysts doesn t increase your risk of breast cancer 
When to see a doctorNormal breast tissue often feels lumpy or nodular 
The lobes are divided into smaller lobules that produce milk during pregnancy and breast feeding 
Breast cysts develop as a result of fluid accumulation inside the glands in the breasts 
They may develop as a result of hormonal changes from monthly menstruation 
Overview Mastitis is an inflammation of breast tissue that sometimes involves an infection 
The inflammation results in breast pain, swelling, warmth and redness 
Mastitis most commonly affects women who are breast feeding lactation mastitis 
But mastitis can occur in women who aren t breast feeding and in men 
Sometimes mastitis leads a mother to wean her baby before she intends to 
When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have breast symptoms that concern you 
Causes Milk that is trapped in the breast is the main cause of mastitis 
The blockage causes milk to back up, leading to breast infection 
Stagnant milk in a breast that isn t emptied provides a breeding ground for the bacteria 
Risk factors Risk factors for mastitis include 
Sore or cracked nipples although mastitis can develop without broken skin 
A lactation consultant can give you tips and provide invaluable advice for proper breast feeding techniques 
Minimize your chances of getting mastitis by following these tips 
Change the position you use to breast feed from one feeding to the next 
The pain may be moderate or severe, and affects both breasts 
In men, breast pain is most commonly caused by a condition called gynecomastia guy nuh koh MAS tee uh 
Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous benign breast condition and rarely indicates breast cancer 
Cyclic means that the pain occurs on a regular pattern 
Noncyclic means that the pain is constant, or that there s not a regular pattern 
Clearly related to the menstrual cycle and changing hormone levels 
Usually affects both breasts, particularly the upper, outer portions, and can radiate to the underarm 
When to see a doctorMake an appointment with your doctor if breast pain 
Causes Changing hormone levels can cause changes in the milk ducts or milk glands 
Noncyclic breast pain may be caused by trauma, prior breast surgery or other factors 
Other factors that may increase the risk of breast pain include 
Neck, shoulder and back pain may accompany breast pain that s caused by large breasts 
Breast pain may be associated with certain antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI antidepressants 
Avoid medications that are known to cause breast pain or make it worse 
Wear a properly fitted bra, and wear a sports bra during exercise 
Subconjunctival hemorrhage broken blood vessel in eye Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
In many ways, it s just like having a bruise on your skin 
The conjunctiva can t absorb blood very quickly, so the blood gets trapped 
A subconjunctival hemorrhage often occurs without any obvious harm to your eye 
Your only discomfort may be a scratchy feeling on the surface of the eye 
Causes The cause of a subconjunctival hemorrhage isn t always known 
The following actions may cause a small blood vessel to rupture in your eye 
In some cases, a subconjunctival hemorrhage may result from an eye injury, including

Certain blood thinning medications, such as warfarin Coumadin, Jantoven and aspirin 
If you need to rub your eyes, rub them gently 
The collarbone, also known as the clavicle, connects the shoulder blade to the breastbone 
Common causes of a broken collarbone include falls, sports and traffic accidents 
Most heal well with ice, pain relievers, a sling, physical therapy and time 
Skin over the break might look like a tent when gently pinched 
Falls, such as falling onto the shoulder or onto an outstretched arm 
Then it rises again in older people as they lose bone strength with age 
Rarely, the jagged ends of a broken collarbone may injure nearby nerves and blood vessels 
Seek immediate medical attention for numbness or coldness in an arm or hand 
A badly broken collarbone might heal slowly or not all the way 
Poor joining of the bones during healing can shorten the bone 
The lump is easy to see because it s close to the skin 
SymptomsA broken foot bone might cause some of these symptoms 
Pain that gets worse with activity and gets better with rest 
Change in the typical shape of the foot, called deformity 
Trouble or pain with walking or putting weight on the foot 
Causes The most common causes of a broken foot include 
So can landing on the feet after jumping down from a height 
Dropping something heavy on the foot is a common cause of fractures 
Sometimes a stumble can result in a twisting injury that can cause a broken bone 
Stress fractures are common in the weight bearing bones of the feet 
Poor training techniques, such as not warming up, can raise the risk of foot injuries 
Studies also show that healing after a break may take longer in people who smoke 
Complications Complications of a broken foot bone aren t common but may include 
Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis years later 
If your foot starts to hurt long after a break, see your healthcare professional 
Trauma to the foot can injure or tear nerves and blood vessels 
Lack of blood flow can cause a bone to die, called avascular necrosis 
PreventionThese sports and safety tips may help prevent a broken foot bone 
If you re a runner, replace your shoes every to miles 
That applies to a new fitness program and to every workout you do 
Get enough calcium and vitamin D Calcium rich foods include dairy products, leafy greens and tofu

Many broken toes are the result of walking in the dark 
Keeping clutter off the floor can help you not trip and fall 
This injury can be caused by direct blows or falls 
Severe pain that might worsen when gripping or squeezing or moving your hand 
Causes Hand fractures can be caused by a direct blow or crushing injury 
Osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones, may also increase your risk of a broken hand 
Complications Complications of a broken hand are rare, but they might include 
Trauma to the hand can injure adjacent nerves and blood vessels 
Seek immediate attention if you have numbness or circulation problems 
PreventionIt s impossible to prevent the unforeseen events that often cause a broken hand 
Eat a nutritious diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D 
Prevent fallsHand fractures can occur when people fall forward onto an outstretched hand 
Remove things you can trip over in your home, such as throw rugs 
Avoid slippery surfaces, if possible, such as snow or ice covered walkways 
Risk increases because bones tend to weaken with age osteoporosis 
A hip fracture almost always requires surgical repair or replacement, followed by physical therapy 
Taking steps to maintain bone density and avoid falls can help prevent a hip fracture 
Inability to get up from a fall or to walk 
Inability to put weight on the leg on the side of the injured hip 
Outward turning of the leg on the side of the injured hip 
Risk factors Many things can increase the risk of hip fractures 
Your age and sexBone density and muscle mass tend to decrease with age 
Hip fractures occur in women about three times more often than they do in men 
However, men also can develop dangerously low levels of bone density 
Medical conditionsThe risk of hip fracture can be increased if you have 
This condition weakens bones and makes them more likely to break 
Conditions that reduce absorption of vitamin D and calcium also can cause weakened bones 
Parkinson s disease, stroke and peripheral neuropathy can increase the risk of falling 
Certain medicationsCortisone medications, such as prednisone, can weaken bones if taken long term 
The most common drugs associated with falls include sleep medications, antipsychotics and sedatives 
Complications A hip fracture can reduce independence and sometimes shorten life 
When hip fractures prevent movement for a long time, complications can include 
Further loss of muscle mass, increasing the risk of falls and injuries 
Weight bearing exercises, such as walking, help maintain peak bone density 
Exercise also increases overall strength, decreasing the risk of falling 
Drinking too much alcohol can also impair balance and increase the risk of falling 
Common causes include falls, motor vehicle accidents and sports injuries 
Treatment of a broken leg depends on the location and severity of the injury 
A severely broken leg may require metal pins and plates to hold the fragments together 
Less severe breaks may be treated with a cast or splint 
In all cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to complete healing 
SymptomsThe thighbone femur is the strongest bone in the body

A simple fall can fracture one or both lower leg bones 
A much higher impact is usually needed to break the thighbone 
All three leg bones can break during a motor vehicle accident 
Extending your leg beyond its natural limits during contact sports can cause a broken leg 
Stress fractures are usually caused by repetitive force or overuse, such as running long distances 
Stress fractures outside of sport situations are more common in people who have 
Complications Complications of a broken leg may include 
A broken bone in your leg may produce pain in your knee or ankle 
A severe leg fracture may not heal quickly or completely 
Seek immediate medical help if you notice any numbness, pale skin or circulation problems 
This condition causes pain, swelling and sometimes disability in muscles near the broken bone 
Fractures that extend into the joint and poor bone alignment can cause osteoarthritis years later 
Calcium rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, can help build strong bones 
A calcium or vitamin D supplement also may improve bone strength 
Ask your health care provider if these supplements are right for you 
Choose the appropriate shoe for your favorite sports or activities 
A broken nose can cause pain, and it is common to get a nosebleed

Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for to weeks but occasionally can last longer 
A small number of children need a stay in the hospital 
SymptomsFor the first few days, the symptoms of bronchiolitis are much like a cold 
Many infants with bronchiolitis also have an ear infection called otitis media 
When to see a doctorIf symptoms become serious, call your child s health care provider 
Get medical attention right away if your child has any of these symptoms 
Has blue or gray skin, lips and fingernails due to low oxygen levels 
Refuses to drink enough, or breathes too fast to eat or drink 
Can t breathe easily and the ribs seem to suck inward when breathing in 
Bronchiolitis is usually caused by the respiratory syncytial virus RSV 
Risk factors Bronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of years 
Other factors that increase the risk of bronchiolitis in infants and young children include 
Contact with lots of other children, such as in a child care setting 
This can cause dehydration, when too much body fluid is lost 
Not being able to get the amount of oxygen needed 
If any of these happen, your child may need to be in the hospital 
Severe respiratory failure may require that a tube be guided into the windpipe 
If you have any of these illnesses, wear a face mask 
Limit contact with people who have a fever or cold 
This is especially important in the first two months of life 
Clean and disinfect surfaces and items that people often touch, such as toys and doorknobs 
This is especially important if a family member is sick 
Frequently wash your own hands and those of your child 
Wash with soap and water for at least seconds 
Keep an alcohol based hand sanitizer handy to use when you re away from home 
If soap and water aren t available, use a hand sanitizer 
If you don t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands 
Don t share glasses with others, especially if someone in your family is ill 
But getting a flu shot every year is recommended for everyone older than months 
People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored 
Often developing from a cold or other respiratory infection, acute bronchitis is very common 
Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD 
SymptomsFor either acute bronchitis or chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include 
At those times, you may have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis 
Is accompanied by fever higher than F C 
The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include 
Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection 
Repeated bouts of bronchitis, however, may mean that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD 
Many cases of acute bronchitis result from influenza, a virus 
Getting a yearly flu vaccine can help protect you from getting the flu 
You may also want to consider vaccination that protects against some types of pneumonia 
Brucellosis Overview Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that spreads from animals to people 
Most commonly, people are infected by eating raw or unpasteurized dairy products 
Signs and symptoms of brucellosis may include fever, joint pain and fatigue 
However, treatment takes several weeks to months, and the infection can recur 
Brucellosis affects hundreds of thousands of people and animals worldwide 
Signs and symptoms are similar to those of the flu and include 
Brucellosis symptoms may disappear for weeks or months and then return 
Some people have chronic brucellosis and experience symptoms for years, even after treatment 
Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart chambers endocarditis 
Arthritis of joints where the spine and pelvis connect sacroiliitis 
A form of brucellosis also affects harbor seals, porpoises and certain whales 
The most common ways that bacteria spread from animals to people are by 
The bacteria can also be transmitted in raw or undercooked meat of infected animals 
Farmers, hunters, laboratory technicians and slaughterhouse workers can inhale the bacteria 
Rarely, brucellosis may spread through sexual activity or through contaminated blood or bone marrow transfusions 
Southern Europe, including Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Southern France 
Chronic brucellosis may cause complications in just one organ or throughout your body 
Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart chambers endocarditis 
This is one of the most serious complications of brucellosis 
PreventionTo reduce the risk of getting brucellosis, take these precautions 
If you re traveling to other countries, avoid all raw dairy foods 
Cook ground meat to F C well done 
Cook all poultry, including ground poultry, to F C 
When traveling outside of the United States, avoid undercooked meats 
If you work in a laboratory, handle all specimens under appropriate biosafety conditions 
In the United States, an aggressive vaccination program has nearly eliminated brucellosis in livestock herds 
Because the brucellosis vaccine is live, it can cause disease in people 
Anyone who has an accidental needle stick while vaccinating an animal should be treated 
Many people with Brugada syndrome don t know they have it 
Signs and symptoms that may be associated with Brugada syndrome include 
An irregular rhythm that lasts for a short time can cause fainting 
Sudden cardiac death can occur if the irregular heartbeat doesn t stop 
A structural problem in the heart, which may be hard to detect 
An imbalance in chemicals that help send electrical signals through the body electrolytes 
Risk factors Risk factors for Brugada syndrome include 
Having family members with Brugada syndrome increases a person s risk of having it, too 
Men are more frequently diagnosed with Brugada syndrome than are women

Overview Bruxism BRUK siz um is a condition in which you grind, gnash or clench your teeth 
Teeth grinding or clenching, which may be loud enough to wake up your sleep partner 
Tired or tight jaw muscles, or a locked jaw that won t open or close completely 
Pain that feels like an earache, though it s actually not a problem with your ear 
Awake bruxism may be due to emotions such as anxiety, stress, anger, frustration or tension 
Or it may be a coping strategy or a habit during deep concentration 
Sleep bruxism may be a sleep related chewing activity associated with arousals during sleep 
Risk factors These factors increase your risk of bruxism 
Bruxism is common in young children, but it usually goes away by adulthood 
Having a personality type that s aggressive, competitive or hyperactive can increase your risk of bruxism 
Bruxism may be an uncommon side effect of some psychiatric medications, such as certain antidepressants 
In Buerger disease also called thromboangiitis obliterans blood vessels become blocked 
Over time, the lack of blood flow damages or destroys skin tissue 
The damage can lead to infection and death of body tissue, called gangrene 
It may eventually affect the blood vessels of the hand 
Blood clots may form in the small veins of the arms and legs 
Quitting all forms of tobacco is the only way to stop Buerger disease 
For those who don t quit, surgery to remove fingers and toes might be needed 
Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see 
The pain may make it difficult to walk long distances 
Pain in the fingers and toes may become severe and occur at rest 
It s thought that chemicals in tobacco may hurt the lining of the blood vessels 
The disease can occur in people who smoke cigarettes, use cigars and chew tobacco 
Long term infection of the gums in the mouth may also increase the risk 
Complications Buerger disease decreases blood flow to the hands and feet 
This can cause painful open sores that do not heal 
Surgery is usually needed to remove the affected finger, toe or other tissue 
PreventionNearly everyone who has Buerger disease has smoked or used some form of tobacco 
To prevent Buerger disease, it s important to not use tobacco 
Talk to a health care provider about ways to quit

Never cook while wearing loosefitting clothes that could catch fire over the stove 
Before placing a child in a car seat, check for hot straps or buckles 
Be sure you have working smoke detectors on each floor of your home 
Check them and change their batteries at least once a year 
Keep a fire extinguisher on every floor of your house 
Keep chemicals, lighters and matches out of the reach of children 
Set your water heater s thermostat to below F C to prevent scalding 
Meralgia paresthetica also is known as lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment 
Tight clothing, obesity or weight gain, and pregnancy are common causes of meralgia paresthetica 
Meralgia paresthetica often can be relieved with conservative measures, including wearing looser clothing 
If symptoms aren t relieved by those measures, treatment may include medicines 
SymptomsMeralgia paresthetica may cause these symptoms in the outer part of the thigh 
When to see your doctorSee your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of meralgia paresthetica 
The nerve supplies feeling to the surface of the outer thigh 
The nerve only affects sensation and doesn t impact your ability to use your leg muscles 
In most people, this nerve passes through the groin to the upper thigh without trouble 
But in meralgia paresthetica, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve becomes trapped 
This ligament runs along the groin from the stomach to the upper thigh 
Common causes of this compression include any condition that increases pressure on the groin, including 
Scar tissue near the inguinal ligament due to injury or past surgery 
Risk factors The following might increase your risk of meralgia paresthetica 
Being overweight or obese can increase the pressure on your lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 
People between ages and are at a higher risk 
The most common locations for bursitis are in the shoulder, elbow and hip 
Bursitis often occurs near joints that perform frequent repetitive motion 
Treatment typically involves resting the affected joint and protecting it from further trauma 
Hurt more when you move it or press on it 
When to see a doctorConsult your doctor if you have 
Excessive swelling, redness, bruising or a rash in the affected area 
Sharp or shooting pain, especially when you exercise or exert yourself 
Throwing a baseball or lifting something over your head repeatedly 
Extensive kneeling for tasks such as laying carpet or scrubbing floors 
Risk factors Anyone can develop bursitis, but certain factors can increase your risk 
Examples include carpet laying, tile setting, gardening, painting and playing a musical instrument 
Being overweight can increase your risk of developing hip and knee bursitis 
Failing to do so puts extra stress on the bursae in your hips 
Carrying heavy loads puts stress on the bursae in your shoulders 
Warming up and stretching before strenuous activities to protect your joints from injury 
They depend on which bursa is affected and what s causing the inflammation 
The affected portion of your knee might feel warm, tender and swollen 
You also might feel pain when you move or when you re at rest 
A direct blow to the knee can cause symptoms to come on fast 
But knee bursitis often stems from friction and irritation of the bursae 
This can occur with jobs that require a lot of kneeling on hard surfaces 
So, the symptoms can start slowly and become worse over time 
When to see a doctorSometimes, the bursa that lies over the kneecap can become infected 
A fever or chills along with pain and swelling in your knee 
Long lasting swelling or a change in the color of the skin around the knee 
Frequent and ongoing pressure, such as from kneeling, especially on hard surfaces 
Medical problems that can happen with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or gout in the knee 
Risk factors Factors that can raise the risk of getting knee bursitis include 
So do sports that create friction between the knee and a mat 
Pes anserine bursitis often occurs in obese women with osteoarthritis 
PreventionThe following tips can help you prevent bursitis or keep it from coming back 
Symptoms can range from diarrhea to life threatening damage to the colon 
The bacterium is often called C difficile or C diff 
Illness from C difficile often occurs after using antibiotic medicines 
It mostly affects older adults in hospitals or in long term care settings 
People not in care settings or hospitals also can get C difficile infection 
SymptomsSymptoms often begin within to days after starting an antibiotic 
Mild to moderate infectionThe most common symptoms of mild to moderate C difficile infection are 
Watery diarrhea three or more times a day for more than one day 
They might need to be treated in a hospital for dehydration 
C difficile infection can cause the colon to become inflamed 
It sometimes can form patches of raw tissue that can bleed or make pus 
Watery diarrhea as often as to times a day 
But toxic megacolon and sepsis aren t common with a C difficile infection 
When to see a doctorSome people have loose stools during or shortly after antibiotic therapy 
Causes C difficile bacteria enter the body through the mouth 
They can live for a long time in places such as 
Because C difficile can live outside the body, the bacteria spread easily 
Not washing hands or cleaning well make it easy to spread the bacteria 
Some people carry C difficile bacteria in their intestines but never get sick from it 
Taking antibiotics or other medicinesThe intestines house a wide range of bacteria 
But the antibiotics that most often lead to C difficile infection include 
Weakened immune system from a medical condition or treatment such as chemotherapy 
Having one C difficile infection increases the chance of having another one 
Severe diarrhea can lead to a serious loss of fluids and minerals called electrolytes 
This makes it hard for the body to work as it should 
It can cause blood pressure to drop so low as to be dangerous 
In this rare condition, the colon can t get rid of gas and stool 
Serious C difficile infection can quickly become fatal if not treated promptly 
PreventionTo protect against C difficile, don t take antibiotics unless you need them 
If you have a loved one in a hospital or nursing home, follow the rules 
Ask questions if you see caregivers or other people not following the rules 
For a C difficile outbreak, using soap and warm water is better for cleaning hands 
Hospital staff and visitors wear disposable gloves and isolation gowns while in the room 
C difficile spores can survive cleaning products that don t have bleach 
The condition can also occur in people without kidney disease 
Blood clotting factors are substances in your blood that help stop bleeding 
These abnormalities can lead to small blood clots forming more often than they normally would 
In addition, people with calciphylaxis have an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium 
Blood clots can cause fat tissues and skin to be deprived of oxygen and nourishment 
Risk factors Calciphylaxis most commonly affects people who have end stage kidney failure 
An imbalance of calcium, phosphorus and aluminum in the body 
Some medications, such as warfarin Coumadin, Jantoven , calcium binding agents or corticosteroids 
Early detection and treatment is very important in helping to prevent serious infections 
They often form on feet and toes or hands and fingers 
They may vary in size and shape and are often larger than corns 
Causes Corns and calluses are caused by friction and pressure from repeated actions 
Tight shoes and high heels can squeeze areas of the feet 
If your shoes are loose, your foot may repeatedly slide and rub against the shoe 
Your foot may also rub against a seam or stitch inside the shoe 
Socks that don t fit right can also be a problem 
Wearing shoes and sandals without socks can cause friction on your feet 
If you can t wiggle your toes, your shoes are too tight 
Have a shoe shop stretch your shoes at any point that rubs or pinches 
Wear felt pads, nonmedicated corn pads or bandages over areas that rub against your footwear 
You can also try toe separators or some lamb s wool between your toes 
Or try padding your tool handles with cloth tape or covers 
Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world 
Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include 
Lump or area of thickening that can be felt under the skin 
Ask about which cancer screening tests and procedures are appropriate for you 
Causes Cancer is caused by changes mutations to the DNA within cells 
What do gene mutations do A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to 
A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly 
This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation 
Cancer cells lose the controls tumor suppressor genes that tell them when to stop growing 
A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating 
DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell s DNA and make corrections 
These mutations are the most common ones found in cancer 
But many other gene mutations can contribute to causing cancer 
What causes gene mutations Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance 
You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents 
This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers 
Most gene mutations occur after you re born and aren t inherited 
However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake 
Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer 
It s not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form 
That s why most people diagnosed with cancer are or older 
Your habitsCertain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer 
Your family historyOnly a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition 
Keep in mind that having an inherited genetic mutation doesn t necessarily mean you ll get cancer 
Complications Cancer and its treatment can cause several complications, including 
Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can often be managed 
Fatigue associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatments is common, but it s usually temporary 
Cancer or cancer treatment may cause a feeling of being short of breath 
Your doctor can sometimes predict if your treatment is likely to cause nausea 
Medications and other treatments may help you prevent or decrease nausea 
Cancer and cancer treatment can affect your bowels and cause diarrhea or constipation 
Cancer steals food from normal cells and deprives them of nutrients 
Signs and symptoms of chemical imbalances might include excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation and confusion 
As cancer advances, it may spread metastasize to other parts of the body 
Ask your doctor about what you can do to reduce your risk of cancer recurrence 
Your doctor may devise a follow up care plan for you after treatment 
PreventionDoctors have identified several ways to reduce your risk of cancer, such as 
Smoking is linked to several types of cancer not just lung cancer 
Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future 
Harmful ultraviolet UV rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer 
Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen 
Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer 
Aim for at least minutes of exercise most days of the week 
Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer 
Ask your doctor whether immunization against these viruses is appropriate for you 
Carcinoid tumors often don t cause signs and symptoms until late in the disease 
Treatment for carcinoid tumors usually includes surgery and may include medications 
Carcinoid tumors in the lungsSigns and symptoms of carcinoid lung tumors include 
Redness or a feeling of warmth in your face and neck skin flushing 
Pink or purple marks on the skin that look like stretch marks 
Nausea, vomiting and inability to pass stool due to intestinal blockage bowel obstruction 
In general, cancer occurs when a cell develops mutations in its DNA 
Cancer cells can invade nearby healthy tissue and spread to other parts of the body 
Doctors don t know what causes the mutations that can lead to carcinoid tumors 
But they know that carcinoid tumors develop in neuroendocrine cells 
Neuroendocrine cells are found in various organs throughout the body 
They perform some nerve cell functions and some hormone producing endocrine cell functions 
Some hormones that are produced by neuroendocrine cells are histamine, insulin and serotonin 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of carcinoid tumors include 
Women are more likely than men to develop carcinoid tumors 
In people with MEN multiple tumors occur in glands of the endocrine system 
This can lead to leaky heart valves and heart failure that may require valve replacement surgery 
Overview Cervical cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the cervix 
The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina 
HPV is a common infection that s passed through sexual contact 
When exposed to HPV, the body s immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm 
In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years 
This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells 
When cervical cancer happens, it s often first treated with surgery to remove the cancer 
Other treatments may include medicines to kill the cancer cells 
Radiation therapy with powerful energy beams also may be used 
As it grows, cervical cancer might cause signs and symptoms, such as 
Menstrual bleeding that is heavier and lasts longer than usual 
Watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor 
Causes Cervical cancer begins when healthy cells in the cervix develop changes in their DNA 
In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body 
This type of cervical cancer begins in thin, flat cells, called squamous cells 
The squamous cells line the outer part of the cervix 
Sometimes, both types of cells are involved in cervical cancer 
Very rarely, cancer occurs in other cells in the cervix 
Risk factors Risk factors for cervical cancer include 
Having sex at an early age increases your risk of HPV 
Other STIs that increase the risk include herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and HIV AIDS 
This medicine was used in the s to prevent miscarriage 
It s linked to a type of cervical cancer called clear cell adenocarcinoma 
Ask your health care team if an HPV vaccine is right for you 
These conditions can be monitored or treated in order to prevent cervical cancer 
Reduce your risk of cervical cancer by taking measures to prevent sexually transmitted infections 
SymptomsMany people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have no symptoms at first 
Causes Doctors aren t certain what starts the process that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
The changes tell the blood cells to produce abnormal, ineffective lymphocytes 
The abnormal lymphocytes accumulate in the blood and certain organs, where they cause complications 
Doctors and researchers are working to understand the exact mechanism that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include 
If you have chronic lymphocytic leukemia, you may experience frequent infections that can be serious 
Sometimes infections happen because your blood doesn t have enough germ fighting antibodies immunoglobulins 
Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made 
CML causes an increased number of white blood cells in the blood 
The term myelogenous my uh LOHJ uh nus refers to the type of cells affected by this cancer 
Chronic myelogenous leukemia also can be called chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic granulocytic leukemia 
Advances in treatment have improved the prognosis of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia 
Most people can achieve remission and live for many years after diagnosis 
Pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side 
Blurry vision caused by bleeding in the back of the eye 
Causes Chronic myelogenous leukemia happens when something causes changes to the bone marrow cells 
However, doctors have discovered how it progresses into chronic myelogenous leukemia 
A new chromosome developsHuman cells typically have pairs of chromosomes 
A section of chromosome switches places with a section of chromosome 
This creates an extra short chromosome and an extra long chromosome 
It is named for the city where it was discovered 
Tyrosine kinase promotes cancer by allowing certain blood cells to grow out of control 
The tyrosine kinase allows too many white blood cells to grow 
Most or all of these cells contain the Philadelphia chromosome 
The diseased white blood cells don t grow and die like they should 
The diseased white blood cells build up in huge numbers 
They crowd out healthy blood cells and damage the bone marrow 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of chronic myelogenous leukemia include 
CML is more common in older people than in children and teens 
Men are slightly more at risk of developing CML than are women 
Radiation therapy for certain types of cancer has been linked to CML 
If you get it, there s nothing you could have done to prevent it 
The colon is the first and longest part of the large intestine 
The large intestine is the last part of the digestive system 
The digestive system breaks down food for the body to use 
Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age 
It usually begins as small clumps of cells called polyps that form inside the colon 
Polyps generally aren t cancerous, but some can turn into colon cancers over time 
For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to look for polyps in the colon 
If colon cancer develops, many treatments can help control it 
Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and medicines, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy 
This term combines colon cancer and rectal cancer, which begins in the rectum 
SymptomsMany people with colon cancer don t have symptoms at first 
A change in bowel habits, such as more frequent diarrhea or constipation 
Ongoing discomfort in the belly area, such as cramps, gas or pain 
A feeling that the bowel doesn t empty all the way during a bowel movement 
Colon cancer happens when cells in the colon develop changes in their DNA 
A cells DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of colon cancer include 
But most people with colon cancer are older than 
The numbers of people younger than who have colon cancer has been growing 
Having had colon cancer or colon polyps increases the risk of colon cancer 
Some DNA changes that increase the risk of colon cancer run in families 
Having a blood relative who has colon cancer increases the risk of getting colon cancer 
Colon cancer and rectal cancer might be linked with a typical Western diet 
People who are not active are more likely to develop colon cancer 
People with diabetes or insulin resistance have an increased risk of colon cancer 
People who are obese have an increased risk of colon cancer 
Obesity also increases the risk of dying of colon cancer 
People who smoke can have an increased risk of colon cancer 
Drinking too much alcohol can increase the risk of colon cancer 
But people with an increased risk should think about starting screening sooner 
People with an increased risk include those with a family history of colon cancer 
There are several different tests that are used for colon cancer screening 
Talk to your health care team about ways to quit 
Try to get at least minutes of exercise on most days 
If you ve been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to minutes 
Also, talk with a health care professional before starting an exercise program 
Aim to lose weight slowly by eating fewer calories and moving more 
Taking aspirin daily has some risks, including ulcers and bleeding in the digestive system 
These options are generally reserved for people with a high risk of colon cancer 
The uterus is the hollow, pear shaped pelvic organ where fetal development happens 
Endometrial cancer is often found at an early stage because it causes symptoms 
If endometrial cancer is found early, surgically removing the uterus often cures it 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of endometrial cancer include 
The two main hormones the ovaries make are estrogen and progesterone 
Changes in the balance of these hormones cause changes in the endometrium 
Examples include obesity, diabetes and irregular ovulation patterns, which might happen in polycystic ovary syndrome 
Starting menstruation before age or beginning menopause later increases the risk of endometrial cancer 
The more periods you ve had, the more exposure your endometrium has had to estrogen 
As you get older, your risk of endometrial cancer increases 
This may happen because extra body fat can alter your body s balance of hormones 
If you re taking tamoxifen, talk about the risk with your health care team 
For most, the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the small risk of endometrial cancer 
Lynch syndrome increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers, including endometrial cancer 
Lynch syndrome is caused by a DNA change that s passed from parents to children 
If you ve been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, ask what cancer screenings you need 
PreventionTo reduce your risk of endometrial cancer, you may wish to 
Talk to your health care team about the risks of hormone therapy after menopause 
A hormone therapy medicine that combines estrogen and progestin can reduce this risk 
Using oral contraceptives for at least one year may reduce endometrial cancer risk 
Oral contraceptives are contraceptives that are taken in pill form 
Esophageal cancer usually begins in the cells that line the inside of the esophagus 
Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide 
Screening for esophageal cancer may be an option for people with Barrett s esophagus 
If you have Barrett s esophagus, discuss the pros and cons of screening with your doctor 
Esophageal cancer occurs when cells in the esophagus develop changes mutations in their DNA 
The changes make cells grow and divide out of control 
The type of esophageal cancer you have helps determine your treatment options 
Adenocarcinoma begins in the cells of mucus secreting glands in the esophagus 
Adenocarcinoma occurs most often in the lower portion of the esophagus 
The squamous cells are flat, thin cells that line the surface of the esophagus 
Squamous cell carcinoma occurs most often in the upper and middle portions of the esophagus 
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most prevalent esophageal cancer worldwide 
Some rare forms of esophageal cancer include small cell carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, melanoma and choriocarcinoma 
Having precancerous changes in the cells of the esophagus Barrett s esophagus 
Having difficulty swallowing because of an esophageal sphincter that won t relax achalasia 
Complications As esophageal cancer advances, it can cause complications, such as 
Cancer may make it difficult for food and liquid to pass through your esophagus 
Though bleeding is usually gradual, it can be sudden and severe at times 
PreventionYou can take steps to reduce your risk of esophageal cancer 
If you smoke, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting 
Add a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to your diet 
Aim for a slow and steady weight loss of or pounds a week 
Your eyes also have melanin producing cells and can develop melanoma 
In addition, eye melanoma typically doesn t cause early signs or symptoms 
Treatment for some small eye melanomas may not interfere with your vision 
However, treatment for large eye melanomas typically causes some vision loss 
When they do occur, signs and symptoms of eye melanoma can include 
A sensation of flashes or specks of dust in your vision floaters 
Sudden changes in your vision signal an emergency, so seek immediate care in those situations 
The mutated cells accumulate in the eye and form an eye melanoma 
The uvea has three parts and each can be affected by eye melanoma 
The iris, which is the colored part in the front of the eye 
Risk factors Risk factors for primary melanoma of the eye include 
White people have a greater risk of eye melanoma than do people of other races 
The role of ultraviolet exposure in eye melanoma is unclear 
Certain genes passed from parents to children may increase the risk of eye melanoma 
You may have difficulty seeing in the center of your vision or on the side 
Overview Gallbladder cancer is an abnormal growth of cells that begins in the gallbladder 
The gallbladder stores bile, a digestive fluid produced by your liver 
Abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right portion of the abdomen 
Gallbladder cancer that begins in this type of cell is called adenocarcinoma 
This term refers to the way the cancer cells appear when examined under a microscope 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of gallbladder cancer include 
The stomach is in the upper middle part of the belly, just below the ribs 
Stomach cancer can happen in any part of the stomach 
In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach 
In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction 
The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus 
Other factors might include the cancer s stage and the type of cells involved 
The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good 
Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry 
Stomach cancer doesn t always cause symptoms in its early stages 
Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer 
If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly 
Many conditions can cause symptoms that are like the ones caused by stomach cancer 
Your provider might test for those other causes first before testing for stomach cancer 
Experts believe most stomach cancers start when something hurts the inside lining of the stomach 
Not everyone with these risk factors gets stomach cancer, though 
So more research is needed to find out exactly what causes it 
Stomach cancer begins when something hurts cells in the inner lining of the stomach 
It causes the cells to develop changes in their DNA 
This causes a lot of extra cells in the stomach 
Cancer cells in the stomach can invade and destroy healthy body tissue 
They might start to grow deeper into the wall of the stomach 
When cancer cells spread to another part of the body it s called metastasis 
Nearly all cancers that start in the stomach are adenocarcinoma stomach cancers 
Carcinoid tumors are cancers that start in the neuroendocrine cells 
Neuroendocrine cells are found in many places in the body 
Lymphoma is a cancer that starts in immune system cells 
This might happen if the body is trying to fight off an infection 
Most lymphomas that start in the stomach are a type of non Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of stomach cancer include 
Infection in the stomach caused by a germ called Helicobacter pylori 
Swelling and irritation of the inside of the stomach, which is called gastritis 
Try to include fruits and vegetables in your diet each day 
Reduce the amount of salty and smoked foods you eat 
Smoking increases your risk of stomach cancer and many other types of cancer 
Quitting smoking can be very hard, so ask your health care provider for help 
Tell your health care provider if stomach cancer runs in your family 
People with a strong family history of stomach cancer might have stomach cancer screening 
Screening tests can detect stomach cancer before it causes symptoms 
Overview Hairy cell leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells 
There are a few different types of white blood cells 
The white blood cells involved in hairy cell leukemia are called B cells 
In hairy cell leukemia, the body makes too many B cells 
The leukemia cells build up in the body and cause symptoms 
This other type of cancer is called hairy cell leukemia variant 
The white blood cells help fight germs in the body 
Hairy cell leukemia happens when B cells develop changes in their DNA 
This leads to the symptoms and complications of hairy cell leukemia 
For example, the extra cells can cause swelling in the spleen, liver and lymph nodes 
Risk factors The risk of hairy cell leukemia may be higher in 
But most people diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia are in their s or s 
Your body needs healthy white blood cells to fight off germs 
If your body can t make enough healthy white blood cells, you might get more infections 
You might also have bleeding from the nose or gums 
Your body needs healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen through your body 
The other cancers include non Hodgkin s lymphoma, Hodgkin s lymphoma and others 
The prognosis continues to improve for people with Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Painless swelling of lymph nodes in your neck, armpits or groin 
The type of lymphoma you have helps determines your treatment options 
Classical Hodgkin s lymphomaClassical Hodgkin s lymphoma is the more common type of this disease 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of Hodgkin s lymphoma include 
Having a blood relative with Hodgkin s lymphoma increases your risk of developing Hodgkin s lymphoma 
People who are infected with HIV have an increased risk of Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Hurthle cell cancer Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The thyroid is a butterfly shaped gland in the base of the neck 
It secretes hormones that are essential for regulating the body s metabolism 
Hurthle cell cancer is also called Hurthle cell carcinoma or oxyphilic cell carcinoma 
This is one of several types of cancers that affect the thyroid 
This type of cancer can be more aggressive than other types of thyroid cancer 
Surgery to remove the thyroid gland is the most common treatment 
A lump in the neck, just below the Adam s apple 
These signs and symptoms don t necessarily mean that you have Hurthle cell cancer 
This cancer begins when cells in the thyroid develop changes in their DNA 
The cells develop the ability to continue living when other cells would naturally die 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of developing thyroid cancer include 
Having a history of radiation treatments to the head and neck 
Overview Kidney cancer is cancer that begins in the kidneys 
Your kidneys are two bean shaped organs, each about the size of your fist 
They re located behind your abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of your spine 
In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer 
Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor 
These tests may lead to the accidental discovery of more kidney cancers 
SymptomsKidney cancer usually doesn t have signs or symptoms in its early stages 
Blood in your urine, which may appear pink, red or cola colored 
Pain in your back or side that doesn t go away 
The changes tell the cells to grow and divide rapidly 
The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can extend beyond the kidney 
Some cells can break off and spread metastasize to distant parts of the body 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of kidney cancer include 
Smokers have a greater risk of kidney cancer than nonsmokers do 
The risk of kidney cancer is higher if close family members have had the disease 
PreventionTaking steps to improve your health may help reduce your risk of kidney cancer 
Many options for quitting exist, including support programs, medications and nicotine replacement products 
Tell your doctor you want to quit, and discuss your options together 
Ask your doctor about other healthy strategies to help you lose weight 
Ask your doctor to check your blood pressure at your next appointment 
If your blood pressure is high, you can discuss options for lowering your numbers 
Lifestyle measures such as exercise, weight loss and diet changes can help 
Some people may need to add medications to lower their blood pressure 
But there are strategies and resources that can help make your treatment successful 
Sometimes leukemia is discovered during blood tests for some other condition 
It seems to develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors 
In leukemia, the mutations tell the blood cells to continue growing and dividing 
The first type of classification is by how fast the leukemia progresses 
In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are immature blood cells blasts 
Some produce too many cells and some cause too few cells to be produced 
The second type of classification is by type of white blood cell affected 
This type of leukemia affects the lymphoid cells lymphocytes , which form lymphoid or lymphatic tissue 
Myeloid cells give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells and platelet producing cells 
This is the most common type of leukemia in young children 
AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults 
Other, rarer types of leukemia exist, including hairy cell leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders 
Genetic abnormalities seem to play a role in the development of leukemia 
Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of leukemia 
However, most people with known risk factors don t get leukemia 
And many people with leukemia have none of these risk factors 
Mouth cancer and other head and neck cancers are often treated similarly 
A white or reddish patch on the inside of your mouth 
The accumulating abnormal mouth cancer cells can form a tumor 
It s not clear what causes the mutations in squamous cells that lead to mouth cancer 
But doctors have identified factors that may increase the risk of mouth cancer 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of mouth cancer include 
Tobacco use of any kind, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff, among others 
However, you can reduce your risk of mouth cancer if you 
Wear a broad brimmed hat that effectively shades your entire face, including your mouth 
Apply a sunscreen lip product as part of your routine sun protection regimen 
Overview Liver cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver 
Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common 
SymptomsMost people don t have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer 
Yellow discoloration of your skin and the whites of your eyes jaundice 
Causes Liver cancer happens when liver cells develop changes mutations in their DNA 
Sometimes the cause of liver cancer is known, such as with chronic hepatitis infections 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of primary liver cancer include 
Liver diseases that can increase the risk of liver cancer include hemochromatosis and Wilson s disease 
An accumulation of fat in the liver increases the risk of liver cancer 
Aflatoxins are poisons produced by molds that grow on crops that are stored poorly 
If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink 
For women, this means no more than one drink a day 
For men, this means no more than two drinks a day 
Don t use intravenous IV drugs, but if you do, use a clean needle 
Reduce your risk of HCV by not injecting illegal drugs 
Contaminated drug paraphernalia is a common cause of hepatitis C infection 
Seek safe, clean shops when getting a piercing or tattoo 
Needles that may not be properly sterilized can spread the hepatitis C virus 
Research shows that treatment can reduce the risk of liver cancer 
Discuss the pros and cons of screening with your doctor 
Together you can decide whether screening is right for you based on your risk 
Screening typically involves a blood test and an abdominal ultrasound exam every six months 
Overview Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide 
SymptomsLung cancer typically doesn t cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages 
Signs and symptoms of lung cancer typically occur when the disease is advanced 
If you smoke and have been unable to quit, make an appointment with your doctor 
In these cases, there may be no clear cause of lung cancer 
At first your body may be able to repair this damage 
But with each repeated exposure, normal cells that line your lungs are increasingly damaged 
Over time, the damage causes cells to act abnormally and eventually cancer may develop 
Your doctor makes treatment decisions based on which major type of lung cancer you have 
Non small cell lung cancer is an umbrella term for several types of lung cancers 
Non small cell lung cancers include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma 
Risk factors A number of factors may increase your risk of lung cancer 
Some risk factors can be controlled, for instance, by quitting smoking 
And other factors can t be controlled, such as your family history 
Quitting at any age can significantly lower your risk of developing lung cancer 
Unsafe levels of radon can accumulate in any building, including homes 
Tell your doctor if you experience pain, as many treatments are available to control pain 
Fluid accumulating in the chest can cause shortness of breath 
Cancer that spreads to other parts of the body metastasis 
Once lung cancer has spread beyond the lungs, it s generally not curable 
Treatments are available to decrease signs and symptoms and to help you live longer 
Quitting reduces your risk of lung cancer, even if you ve smoked for years 
Talk to your doctor about strategies and stop smoking aids that can help you quit 
If you live or work with a smoker, urge him or her to quit 
At the very least, ask him or her to smoke outside 
Avoid areas where people smoke, such as bars and restaurants, and seek out smoke free options 
High radon levels can be remedied to make your home safer 
Take precautions to protect yourself from exposure to toxic chemicals at work 
For instance, if you re given a face mask for protection, always wear it 
Ask your doctor what more you can do to protect yourself at work 
Your risk of lung damage from workplace carcinogens increases if you smoke 
Choose a healthy diet with a variety of fruits and vegetables 
Avoid taking large doses of vitamins in pill form, as they may be harmful 
Results showed the supplements actually increased the risk of cancer in smokers 
Merkel cell carcinoma is also called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin 
The nodule may be skin colored or may appear in shades of red, blue or purple 
Merkel cells are found at the base of the outermost layer of your skin epidermis 
Just how this virus causes Merkel cell carcinoma has yet to be determined 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of Merkel cell carcinoma include 
The majority of Merkel cell carcinomas appear on skin surfaces frequently exposed to sun 
Your risk of Merkel cell carcinoma increases as you age 
Merkel cell carcinoma usually arises in people who have light colored skin 
Whites are much more likely to be affected by this skin cancer than are blacks 
Complications Cancer that spreads to other parts of the bodyEven with treatment 
, Merkel cell carcinoma commonly spreads metastasizes beyond the skin 
Merkel cell carcinoma tends to travel first to nearby lymph nodes 
Cancer that has metastasized is more difficult to treat and can be fatal 
Reducing your sun exposure may reduce your risk of skin cancer 
Wear a wide brimmed hat, tightly woven clothing and sunglasses with ultraviolet UV light protection 
Mesothelioma treatments are available, but for many people with mesothelioma, a cure isn t possible 
Doctors divide mesothelioma into different types based on what part of the mesothelium is affected 
Mesothelioma most often affects the tissue that surrounds the lungs pleura 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of mesothelioma vary depending on where the cancer occurs 
Unusual lumps of tissue under the skin on your chest 
The mutations tell the cell to grow and multiply out of control 
Asbestos is a mineral that s found naturally in the environment 
This indicates that other factors may be involved in determining whether someone gets mesothelioma 
Pain caused by pressure on the nerves and spinal cord 
PreventionReducing your exposure to asbestos may lower your risk of mesothelioma 
Ask your employer whether you have a risk of asbestos exposure on the job 
Be safe around asbestos in your homeOlder homes and buildings may contain asbestos 
Breaking up asbestos may cause fibers to become airborne, where they can be inhaled 
Don t attempt to remove asbestos from your home hire a qualified expert 
Healthy plasma cells help fight infections by making proteins called antibodies 
In multiple myeloma, cancerous plasma cells build up in bone marrow 
The bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made 
In the bone marrow, the cancer cells crowd out healthy blood cells 
Rather than make helpful antibodies, the cancer cells make proteins that don t work right 
Multiple myeloma begins with one plasma cell in the bone marrow 
Something happens that turns the plasma cell into a cancerous myeloma cell 
The myeloma cell begins making a lot more myeloma cells quickly 
Healthy cells grow at a set pace and die at a set time 
This leads to tiredness and not being able to fight infections 
The myeloma cells continue trying to make antibodies, as healthy plasma cells do 
But the body can t use these antibodies, called monoclonal proteins or M proteins 
Myeloma cells can damage bones and increase the risk of broken bones 
In MGUS, the level of M proteins in the blood is low 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of multiple myeloma include 
Men are more likely to develop the disease than are women 
Black people are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than are people of other races 
Having a sibling or parent with multiple myeloma increases the risk of the disease 
Multiple myeloma starts as MGUS, so having this condition increases the risk 
If you get multiple myeloma, you didn t do anything to cause it 
Having multiple myeloma lowers the body s ability to fight infections 
Multiple myeloma can cause bone pain, thinning bones and broken bones 
It occurs much more frequently in other parts of the world specifically Southeast Asia 
Treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma usually involves radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination of the two 
SymptomsIn its early stages, nasopharyngeal carcinoma may not cause any symptoms 
A lump in your neck caused by a swollen lymph node 
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is more common in men than it is in women 
Inuits in Alaska also have an increased risk of nasopharyngeal cancer 
Being exposed to these chemicals at an early age may increase the risk even more 
This common virus usually produces mild signs and symptoms, such as those of a cold 
The Epstein Barr virus is also linked to several rare cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
Having a family member with nasopharyngeal carcinoma increases your risk of the disease 
Heavy alcohol intake and tobacco use can raise your risk of developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
Screening may involve blood tests to detect the Epstein Barr virus 
Some forms of neuroblastoma go away on their own, while others may require multiple treatments 
Your child s neuroblastoma treatment options will depend on several factors 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of neuroblastoma vary depending on what part of the body is affected 
A mass under the skin that isn t tender when touched 
Neuroblastoma in the chest may cause signs and symptoms such as 
Changes to the eyes, including drooping eyelids and unequal pupil size 
It isn t clear what causes the initial genetic mutation that leads to neuroblastoma 
Yet, familial neuroblastoma is thought to comprise a very small number of neuroblastoma cases 
In most cases of neuroblastoma, a cause is never identified 
Tumors may grow and press on the spinal cord, causing spinal cord compression 
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma are among the most common subtypes 
Causes In most instances, doctors don t know what causes non Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Old lymphocytes die, and your body creates new ones to replace them 
In non Hodgkin s lymphoma, your lymphocytes don t die, and your body keeps creating new ones 
This oversupply of lymphocytes crowds into your lymph nodes, causing them to swell 
B cells and T cellsNon Hodgkin s lymphoma most often begins in the 
T cells are a type of lymphocyte that s involved in killing foreign invaders directly 
But the disease can also spread to other parts of your lymphatic system 
These include the lymphatic vessels, tonsils, adenoids, spleen, thymus and bone marrow 
Occasionally, non Hodgkin s lymphoma involves organs outside of your lymphatic system 
Risk factors Most people diagnosed with non Hodgkin s lymphoma don t have any obvious risk factors 
And many people who have risk factors for the disease never develop it 
Some factors that may increase the risk of non Hodgkin s lymphoma include 
Certain viral and bacterial infections appear to increase the risk of non Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Viruses linked to this type of cancer include HIV and Epstein Barr infection 
Bacteria linked to non Hodgkin s lymphoma include the ulcer causing Helicobacter pylori 
Non Hodgkin s lymphoma can occur at any age, but the risk increases with age 
Overview Ovarian cancer is a growth of cells that forms in the ovaries 
The cells multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue 
The female reproductive system contains two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus 
SymptomsWhen ovarian cancer first develops, it might not cause any noticeable symptoms 
When ovarian cancer symptoms happen, they re usually attributed to other, more common conditions 
The cancer cells continue living when healthy cells would die 
It includes several subtypes, including serous carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma 
These rare tumors are usually diagnosed at an earlier stage than other ovarian cancers 
These rare ovarian cancers tend to occur at a younger age 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of ovarian cancer include 
The genes that increase the risk of ovarian cancer include BRCA and BRCA 
Being overweight or obese increases the risk of ovarian cancer 
If you ve never been pregnant, you may have an increased risk of ovarian cancer 
Ask your doctor whether birth control pills oral contraceptives may be right for you 
Taking birth control pills reduces the risk of ovarian cancer 
Your doctor can determine what this may mean for your own risk of cancer 
The pancreas lies behind the lower part of the stomach 
It makes enzymes that help digest food and hormones that help manage blood sugar 
The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a mix of these 
SymptomsPancreatic cancer often doesn t cause symptoms until the disease is advanced 
When they happen, signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer may include 
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice 
New diagnosis of diabetes or diabetes that s getting harder to control 
Doctors have found some factors that might raise the risk of this type of cancer 
These include smoking and having a family history of pancreatic cancer 
These hormones help the body process the sugar in the foods you eat 
Most pancreatic cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas 
This type of cancer is called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or pancreatic exocrine cancer 
These types of cancer are called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or pancreatic endocrine cancer 
Risk factors Factors that might raise the risk of pancreatic cancer include 
Family history of DNA changes that can increase cancer risk 
These include changes in the BRCA gene, Lynch syndrome and familial atypical multiple mole melanoma 
Complications As pancreatic cancer progresses, it can cause complications such as 
Pancreatic cancer that blocks the liver s bile duct can cause jaundice 
Signs include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes 
This is done using a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, also called ERCP 
The tube goes through the stomach and into the upper part of the small intestine 
The dye helps the ducts show up on imaging tests 
When medicines aren t helping, a health care professional might suggest a celiac plexus block 
The alcohol stops the nerves from sending pain signals to the brain 
This can block the flow of digested food from the stomach into the intestines 
Sometimes, it might help to have surgery to place a feeding tube 
It might be an option if you have a very high risk of pancreatic cancer 
Pancreatic cancer screening might involve imaging tests, such as MRI and ultrasound 
Talk about the benefits and risks of pancreatic cancer screening with your health care team 
Together you can decide whether screening is right for you 
Ways to lower riskYou might reduce your risk of pancreatic cancer if you 
These might include support groups, medicines and nicotine replacement therapy 
If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain it 
To help you lose weight, exercise most days of the week 
Choose a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and whole grains with smaller portions 
But sometimes paraneoplastic syndromes can result in permanent damage to the nervous system 
Symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include 
Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects 
Types of paraneoplastic syndromesExamples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include 
The limbic system controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions 
This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord 
There may be a wide variety of symptoms depending on the area affected 
This syndrome occurs when the cerebellum or its connections don t work properly 
This term refers to a syndrome that involves injury to the spinal cord 
This syndrome is caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles 
Symptoms include muscle weakness in the pelvis and legs, and fatigue 
It also may cause trouble swallowing and speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision 
Myasthenia gravis also is related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles 
These include muscles in the face, eyes, arms and legs 
The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well 
Neuromyotonia occurs when there are an excess number of nerve impulses that control muscle movement 
It also may cause muscle cramps, slowed movement and other issues with the muscles 
Symptoms may include low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing 
They re also not caused by other complications, such as infections or treatment side effects 
Overview Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate 
Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer 
SymptomsProstate cancer may cause no signs or symptoms in its early stages 
Prostate cancer that s more advanced may cause signs and symptoms such as 
The changes tell the cells to grow and divide more rapidly than normal cells do 
The abnormal cells continue living, when other cells would die 
The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can grow to invade nearby tissue 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of prostate cancer include 
In Black people, prostate cancer is also more likely to be aggressive or advanced 
Complications Complications of prostate cancer and its treatments include 
Prostate cancer that spreads to the bones can cause pain and broken bones 
Both prostate cancer and its treatment can cause urinary incontinence 
PreventionYou can reduce your risk of prostate cancer if you 
Fruits and vegetables contain many vitamins and nutrients that can contribute to your health 
Whether you can prevent prostate cancer through diet has yet to be conclusively proved 
Exercise improves your overall health, helps you maintain your weight and improves your mood 
Ask your doctor for help creating a plan for healthy weight loss 
Talk to your doctor about increased risk of prostate cancer 
These drugs are used to control prostate gland enlargement and hair loss 
If you re concerned about your risk of developing prostate cancer, talk with your doctor 
Overview Rectal cancer is cancer that begins in the rectum 
The rectum is the last several inches of the large intestine 
While rectal and colon cancers are similar in many ways, their treatments are quite different 
The tight space can make surgery to remove rectal cancer complex 
A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or more frequent bowel movements 
With time, the cancer cells can grow to invade and destroy healthy tissue nearby 
And cancerous cells can break away and travel metastasize to other parts of the body 
These mutations are involved in only a small percentage of rectal cancers 
People with Lynch syndrome tend to develop colon cancer before age 
Genetic testing can detect these and other, rarer inherited colorectal cancer syndromes 
If you re inactive, you re more likely to develop colorectal cancer 
Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of cancer 
People with poorly controlled type diabetes may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer 
People who smoke may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer 
PreventionTo reduce your risk of colorectal cancer, consider trying to 
Several screening options exist each with its own benefits and drawbacks 
Also, talk to your doctor before beginning any exercise program 
If you re having trouble quitting, talk to your doctor about options 
The retina is the light sensitive lining on the inside of the eye 
The light causes the retina to send signals to the brain 
For most children, treatment doesn t require removing the eye to get rid of the cancer 
The outlook for children diagnosed with retinoblastoma is quite good 
Causes Retinoblastoma is caused by changes inside the cells in the eye 
It s not always clear what causes the changes that lead to this eye cancer 
Retinoblastoma starts when cells in the eye get changes in their DNA 
The instructions also tell the cells to die at a set time 
In retinoblastoma, this growth of cells happens in the retina 
However, it s possible for children to inherit DNA changes from their parents 
Risk factors Risk factors for retinoblastoma include 
DNA variations that increase the risk of retinoblastoma can be passed from parents to children 
Children with these inherited DNA changes tend to get retinoblastoma at a younger age 
For this reason, your child s healthcare team will create a plan of follow up appointments 
Your child s follow up plan will depend on the treatments your child received 
Your child s healthcare team might recommend tests to screen for these other types of cancers 
Some retinoblastomas are caused by DNA changes that run in families 
If retinoblastoma runs in your family, tell your healthcare professional 
This person can help you decide whether to undergo genetic testing 
Your healthcare team may have options to help you manage this risk 
Checking your skin for suspicious changes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages 
Early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment 
Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions 
Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men 
In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs 
A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds 
Signs and symptoms of less common skin cancersOther, less common types of skin cancer include 
Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk 
This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin 
Your doctor will investigate your skin changes to determine a cause 
Causes Skin cancer occurs when errors mutations occur in the DNA of skin cells 
Cells involved in skin cancerSkin cancer begins in your skin s top layer the epidermis 
Squamous cells lie just below the outer surface and function as the skin s inner lining 
Basal cells, which produce new skin cells, sit beneath the squamous cells 
Where your skin cancer begins determines its type and your treatment options 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of skin cancer include 
However, having less pigment melanin in your skin provides less protection from damaging UV radiation 
Tanning, including exposure to tanning lamps and beds, also puts you at risk 
A tan is your skin s injury response to excessive UV radiation 
Living at higher elevations, where the sunlight is strongest, also exposes you to more radiation 
If you have a history of abnormal moles, watch them regularly for changes 
Having skin lesions known as actinic keratoses can increase your risk of developing skin cancer 
If you developed skin cancer once, you re at risk of developing it again 
People with weakened immune systems have a greater risk of developing skin cancer 
This includes people living with HIV AIDS and those taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant 
Exposure to certain substances, such as arsenic, may increase your risk of skin cancer 
You absorb UV radiation year round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays 
Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer 
But they play a major role in an overall sun protection program 
Look for those that block both types of UV radiation UVA and UVB rays 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the side effects of any medications you take 
Examine your chest and trunk, and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands 
The soft tissues connect, support and surround other body structures 
Soft tissues include muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and linings of the joints 
It happens most often in the arms, legs and belly 
SymptomsA soft tissue sarcoma may not cause any symptoms at first 
Causes It s not clear what causes most soft tissue sarcomas 
Soft tissue sarcoma starts when a connective tissue cell gets changes in its DNA 
The changes turn the connective tissue cells into cancer cells 
The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and make more cells 
In some types of soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells stay in one location 
They continue making more cells and cause the tumor to get bigger 
Risk factors Factors that may raise the risk of sarcoma include 
A risk of soft tissue sarcoma can run in families 
Being exposed to certain chemicals may increase the risk of soft tissue sarcomas 
Radiation therapy for other cancers can increase the risk of soft tissue sarcomas 
The squamous cells make up the middle and outer layers of the skin 
Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually not life threatening 
Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are caused by too much ultraviolet UV radiation 
UV radiation comes either from sunlight or from tanning beds or lamps 
SymptomsSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin most often occurs on sun exposed skin 
This includes the scalp, the backs of the hands, the ears or the lips 
The nodule might be the same color as the skin, or it might look different 
It can look pink, red, black or brown, depending on skin color 
A new sore or raised area on an old scar or sore 
A rough, scaly patch on the lip that may become an open sore 
A raised patch or wartlike sore on or in the anus or on the genitals 
Cells DNA holds the instructions that tell cells what to do 
Ultraviolet UV radiation causes most of the DNA changes in skin cells 
UV radiation can come from sunlight, tanning lamps and tanning beds 
But skin cancers also can grow on skin that s not usually in sunlight 
This means that other factors might add to the risk of skin cancer 
One such factor might be having a condition that weakens the immune system 
Anyone of any skin color can get squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 
But it s more common in people who have low levels of melanin in their skin 
It also helps protect the skin from damaging ultraviolet UV radiation 
People with Black or brown skin have more melanin than people with white skin 
UV radiation from the sun increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 
Covering the skin with clothes or sunblock can help lower the risk 
Some types of skin sores can turn into skin cancer 
Having one of these conditions increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma 
People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of skin cancer 
Complications Untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can destroy nearby healthy tissue 
It can spread to the lymph nodes or other organs 
And it can be fatal, although this is not common 
PreventionMost squamous cell carcinomas of the skin can be prevented 
Stay out of the sun during the middle of the day 
Apply again every two hours, or more often if you re swimming or sweating 
Wear dark, tightly woven clothes that cover arms and legs 
Wear a wide brimmed hat that shades your face and ears 
Look for those that block both types of UV radiation, UVA and UVB rays 
Check your skin often and report changes to your health care team 
Use mirrors to check your face, neck, ears and scalp 
Look at the front and back of your legs and your feet 
Look at the bottom of the feet and the spaces between your toes 
Overview Testicular cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the testicles 
The testicles, which are also called testes, are in the scrotum 
The scrotum is a loose bag of skin underneath the penis 
The first sign of testicular cancer often is a bump or lump on a testicle 
They often spread outside the testicle to other parts of the body 
Testicular cancer is highly treatable, even when it spreads to other parts of the body 
These include pain, swelling or lumps in your testicles or groin area 
Testicular cancer starts when something causes changes to the DNA of testicle cells 
The changes tell the cells to grow and multiply quickly 
Some cells might break away and spread to other parts of the body 
Testicular cancer most often spreads to the lymph nodes, liver and lungs 
It s not clear what causes DNA changes in the germ cells 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of testicular cancer include 
If you have a testicle that never descended, your risk of testicular cancer is higher 
If testicular cancer runs in your family, you might have an increased risk 
But it s most common in teens and young adults between and 
If you get testicular cancer, there s nothing you could have done to prevent it 
Testicular cancer screeningSome health care providers recommend regular testicle self exams 
During a testicular self exam you feel your testicles for any lumps or other changes 
Overview Throat cancer refers cancer that develops in your throat pharynx or voice box larynx 
Your voice box sits just below your throat and also is susceptible to throat cancer 
Subglottic cancer begins in the lower portion of your voice box, below your vocal cords 
Changes in your voice, such as hoarseness or not speaking clearly 
Causes Throat cancer occurs when cells in your throat develop genetic mutations 
The accumulating cells can form a tumor in your throat 
It s not clear what causes the mutation that causes throat cancer 
But doctors have identified factors that may increase your risk 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of throat cancer include 
PreventionThere s no proven way to prevent throat cancer from occurring 
But in order to reduce your risk of throat cancer, you can 
Stopping smoking can be very difficult, so get some help 
The vitamins and antioxidants in fruits and vegetables may reduce your risk of throat cancer 
Overview Thyroid cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the thyroid 
The thyroid produces hormones that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight 
Most types grow slowly, though some types can be very aggressive 
Thyroid cancers found in this way are usually small cancers that respond well to treatments 
SymptomsMost thyroid cancers don t cause any signs or symptoms early in the disease 
A lump nodule that can be felt through the skin on your neck 
A feeling that close fitting shirt collars are becoming too tight 
Causes Thyroid cancer happens when cells in the thyroid develop changes in their DNA 
The changes, which doctors call mutations, tell the cells to grow and multiply rapidly 
The cells go on living when healthy cells would naturally die 
The type of thyroid cancer is considered in determining your treatment and prognosis 
Differentiated thyroid cancers cells appear similar to healthy cells when viewed under a microscope 
This rare type of thyroid cancer usually affects people older than 
Follicular thyroid cancer cells don t often spread to the lymph nodes in the neck 
But some large and aggressive cancers may spread to other parts of the body 
Follicular thyroid cancer most often spreads to the lungs and bones 
This rare type of thyroid cancer was once considered a type of follicular thyroid cancer 
This rare type of thyroid cancer grows quickly and can be difficult to treat 
However, treatments can help slow the progression of the disease 
Anaplastic thyroid cancer tends to occur in people older than 
Familial medullary thyroid cancer increases the risk of thyroid cancer 
Other very rare types of cancer can start in the thyroid 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of thyroid cancer include 
Thyroid cancer occurs more often in women than in men 
Experts think it may be related to the hormone estrogen 
Radiation therapy treatments to the head and neck increase the risk of thyroid cancer 
This could happen if cancer cells spread beyond the thyroid before it s removed 
Thyroid cancer that comes back still has a good prognosis 
It s often treatable, and most people will have successful treatment 
Other areas of the body, such as the lungs and bones 
Overview Vaginal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the vagina 
It s a muscular tube that connects the uterus with the outer genitals 
Most cancer that happens in the vagina starts somewhere else and spreads to the vagina 
When the cancer spreads beyond the vagina, it s much harder to treat 
As it grows, vaginal cancer may cause signs and symptoms, such as 
Vaginal bleeding that isn t typical, such as after menopause or after sex 
Causes Vaginal cancer begins when cells in the vagina develop changes in their DNA 
Vaginal squamous cell carcinoma, which begins in thin, flat cells called squamous cells 
Vaginal adenocarcinoma, which begins in the glandular cells on the surface of the vagina 
It s linked to a medicine called diethylstilbestrol that was once used to prevent miscarriage 
Vaginal melanoma, which begins in the pigment producing cells, called melanocytes 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of vaginal cancer include 
HPV is thought to cause many types of cancer, including vaginal cancer 
For most people, HPV infection goes away on its own and never causes any problems 
Diethylstilbestrol, also called DES, was once used to prevent miscarriage 
It s linked to a type of vaginal cancer called clear cell adenocarcinoma 
Complications Vaginal cancer can spread to other parts of the body 
It most often spreads to the lungs, liver and bones 
Ask your healthcare team whether an HPV vaccine is right for you 
The mutations tell the cell to grow and divide rapidly 
The cell and its offspring go on living when other normal cells would die 
This cancer begins in the thin, flat cells that line the surface of the vulva 
This cancer begins in the pigment producing cells found in the skin of the vulva 
The risk of vulvar cancer increases with age, though it can occur at any age 
Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is a precancerous condition that increases the risk of vulvar cancer 
Condoms may reduce your risk of contracting HPV but can t fully protect against it 
Ask your doctor about pelvic examsAsk your doctor how often you should undergo pelvic exams 
Overview Wilms tumor is a rare kidney cancer that mainly affects children 
Also known as nephroblastoma, it s the most common cancer of the kidneys in children 
Wilms tumor most often affects children ages to 
But it can sometimes be in both kidneys at the same time 
With treatment, the outlook for most children with Wilms tumor is good 
But others with Wilms tumor have one or more of these symptoms 
A mass in the stomach area that can be felt 
Cells DNA holds the instructions that tell the cells what to do 
The cancer cells live while healthy cells die as part of their natural life cycle 
With Wilms tumor, the changes make extra cells in the kidney that form the tumor 
Rarely, DNA changes passed from parents to children can increase the risk of Wilms tumor 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of Wilms tumor include 
Asian American children appear to have a lower risk than children of other races 
Wilms tumor occurs more often in children who have certain conditions present at birth, including 
Wilms tumor can occur as part of rare syndromes, including 
This syndrome includes Wilms tumor, aniridia, genital and urinary system problems, and intellectual disabilities 
This syndrome includes Wilms tumor, kidney disease and male pseudohermaphroditism soo do her MAF roe dit iz um 
Oral thrush causes creamy white lesions, usually on your tongue or inner cheeks 
Initially, you may not even notice symptoms of oral thrush 
Redness, burning or soreness that may be severe enough to cause difficulty eating or swallowing 
They can pass the infection to their mothers during breast feeding 
Women whose breasts are infected with candida may experience these signs and symptoms 
Shiny or flaky skin on the darker, circular area around the nipple areola 
The most common type of candida fungus is Candida albicans 
Several factors, such as a weakened immune system, can increase your risk of oral thrush 
Vaginal yeast infections are caused by the same fungus that causes oral thrush 
Complications Oral thrush is seldom a problem for healthy children and adults 
Untreated oral thrush can lead to more serious systemic candida infections 
PreventionThese measures may help reduce your risk of developing candida infections 
Ask your dentist for the best way to clean your type of dentures 
See your dentist regularly, especially if you have diabetes or wear dentures 
Ask your dentist how often you need to be seen 
Ask your doctor about ways to avoid or treat your dry mouth 
A vaginal yeast infection isn t considered a sexually transmitted infection 
SymptomsYeast infection symptoms can range from mild to moderate, and include 
Thick, white, odor free vaginal discharge with a cottage cheese appearance 
Complicated yeast infectionYou might have a complicated yeast infection if 
You have four or more yeast infections in a year 
Your infection is caused by a less typical type of fungus 
Your immune system is weakened because of certain medications or conditions such as HIV infection 
When to see a doctorMake an appointment with your doctor if 
This is the first time you ve had yeast infection symptoms 
Your symptoms aren t relieved after treating with over the counter antifungal vaginal creams or suppositories 
The fungus candida albicans is responsible for most vaginal yeast infections 
Your vagina naturally contains a balanced mix of yeast, including candida, and bacteria 
Certain bacteria lactobacillus act to prevent an overgrowth of yeast 
Antibiotic use, which causes an imbalance in natural vaginal flora 
Taking oral contraceptives or hormone therapy that increase estrogen levels 
Candida albicans is the most common type of fungus to cause yeast infections 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing a yeast infection include 
Unnecessary antibiotic use, such as for colds or other viral infections 
Staying in wet clothes, such as swimsuits and workout attire, for long periods of time 
Overview Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide builds up in the blood 
This can lead to serious tissue damage, or even death 
Carbon monoxide is gas that has no odor, taste or color 
Burning fuels, including gas, wood, propane or charcoal, make carbon monoxide 
SymptomsCarbon monoxide poisoning affects the brain and heart the most 
Carbon monoxide poisoning can be especially dangerous for people who are asleep, drugged or drunk 
Carbon monoxide can cause brain damage or death before anyone realizes there s a problem 
For possible carbon monoxide poisoning, get into fresh air and seek medical care right away 
Examples are using a charcoal grill indoors or a running car inside a garage 
Breathing the fumes causes carbon monoxide to replace oxygen in the blood 
Breathing in smoke during a fire also can cause carbon monoxide poisoning 
Risk factors Breathing in carbon monoxide can be especially dangerous for 
Fetal blood cells take up carbon monoxide more easily than adult blood cells do 
Older people who have carbon monoxide poisoning may be more likely to get brain damage 
Damage to the heart, possibly leading to life threatening heart problems 
Put them near each sleeping area on every level of the house 
Leave the house and call or the fire department 
Carbon monoxide detectors are also made for motor homes and boats 
Don t run a generator in an enclosed space, such as the basement or garage 
These include all gas appliances, space heaters and wood burning stoves 
Have professionals set up all gas, oil or coal burning appliances 
Carcinoid syndrome typically occurs in people who have carcinoid tumors that are advanced 
Medications may be recommended to relieve your carcinoid syndrome symptoms and make you more comfortable 
Flushing episodes may last from a few minutes to a few hours or longer 
Purplish areas of spiderlike veins may appear on your nose and upper lip 
Periods of a fast heart rate could be a sign of carcinoid syndrome 
Only a small percentage of carcinoid tumors secrete the chemicals that cause carcinoid syndrome 
Some carcinoid tumors don t have to be advanced to cause carcinoid syndrome 
The liver usually neutralizes the chemicals before they can affect the rest of the body 
Signs and symptoms of carcinoid heart disease include fatigue and shortness of breath 
Surgical repair of damaged heart valves may be an option 
Carcinoid crisis causes a severe episode of flushing, low blood pressure, confusion and breathing difficulty 
Your doctor may give you medications before surgery to reduce the risk of carcinoid crisis 
If the cancer has spread metastasized , those sites might be discovered, too 
Doctors consider the location of the primary tumor when choosing the most appropriate treatments 
Changes in bowel habits, such as new and persistent constipation or diarrhea 
Causes In general, cancer forms when cells develop changes mutations in their DNA 
The DNA contains instructions that tell cells what to do 
The original cancer is too small to be detected by imaging tests 
The original cancer was killed by the body s immune system 
The original cancer was removed in an operation for another condition 
Risk factors The risk of carcinoma of unknown primary might be related to 
This type of cancer is most likely to occur in people older than 
Without immediate treatment, sudden cardiac arrest can lead to death 
Sudden cardiac arrest isn t the same as a heart attack 
A heart attack happens when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked 
SymptomsSymptoms of sudden cardiac arrest are immediate and severe and include 
If you see someone who s unconscious and not breathing, call or local emergency services 
The American Heart Association recommends doing CPR with hard and fast chest compressions 
Use an automated external defibrillator, called an AED, if one is available 
How to do CPRDo CPR if the person isn t breathing 
If you ve been trained in CPR, check the person s airway 
Keep doing this until an AED is available or emergency workers arrive 
Causes A change in the heart s electrical activity causes sudden cardiac arrest 
Electric signals in the heart control the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat 
Certain heart conditions can make you more likely to have this type of heartbeat problem 
However, sudden cardiac arrest can happen in people who have no known heart disease 
Also, a heart attack can leave scar tissue in the heart 
This condition usually happens when the walls in the heart muscle stretch 
Heart problem present at birth, called a congenital heart defect 
If the heart rhythm isn t quickly restored, sudden death can occur 
Young people with LQTS are especially at risk of sudden death 
Other things that might increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest include 
A previous episode of sudden cardiac arrest or a family history of it 
Growing older the risk of sudden cardiac arrest increases with age 
Complications When sudden cardiac arrest occurs, less blood flows to the brain 
If the heart rhythm isn t rapidly restored, complications may include brain damage and death 
PreventionKeeping the heart healthy may help prevent sudden cardiac arrest 
You also might consider purchasing an automated external defibrillator AED for home use 
AEDs help reset the heart s rhythm when a person has sudden cardiac arrest 
But they can be expensive and aren t always covered by health insurance 
Treatment for myocardial ischemia involves improving blood flow to the heart muscle 
Treatment may include medications, a procedure to open blocked arteries angioplasty or bypass surgery 
Making heart healthy lifestyle choices is important in treating and preventing myocardial ischemia 
The low blood flow decreases the amount of oxygen your heart muscle receives 
Myocardial ischemia can develop slowly as arteries become blocked over time 
Or it can occur quickly when an artery becomes blocked suddenly 
The plaques that develop in atherosclerosis can rupture, causing a blood clot 
Rarely, a blood clot might travel to the coronary artery from elsewhere in the body 
Coronary artery spasm is an uncommon cause of myocardial ischemia 
Chest pain associated with myocardial ischemia can be triggered by 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of developing myocardial ischemia include 
Smoking and long term exposure to secondhand smoke can damage the inside walls of arteries 
Over time, high blood pressure can accelerate atherosclerosis, resulting in damage to the coronary arteries 
Cholesterol is a major part of the deposits that can narrow your coronary arteries 
Triglycerides, another type of blood fat, also may contribute to atherosclerosis 
Obesity is associated with diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol levels 
An abnormal heart rhythm can weaken your heart and may be life threatening 
Over time, repeated episodes of ischemia may lead to heart failure 
When treated immediately, about half the people who develop the condition survive 
Drug overdoses or poisoning with substances that can affect your heart s pumping ability 
Have blockages coronary artery disease in several of your heart s main arteries 
Complications If not treated immediately, cardiogenic shock can lead to death 
If you smoke, the best way to reduce your heart attack risk is to quit 
Losing just pounds kilograms can lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol levels 
Limiting these, especially saturated fat, can reduce your risk of heart disease 
Aim for less than , milligrams mg a day of sodium 
This will help you avoid nutrient poor calories and help you maintain a healthy weight 
It s recommended to spread out this exercise during the course of a week 
Greater amounts of exercise will provide even greater health benefits 
If you have a heart attack, quick action can help prevent cardiogenic shock 
Seek emergency medical help if you think you re having a heart attack 
Other tests are then needed to diagnose the condition that s causing the enlarged heart 
Heart damage and certain types of heart disease can cause an enlarged heart 
Depending on the condition, an enlarged heart may be temporary or permanent 
Treatment for an enlarged heart may include medications, medical procedures or surgery 
SymptomsIn some people, an enlarged heart cardiomegaly causes no signs or symptoms 
Talk to your health care provider if you have concerns about your heart 
Sometimes the heart gets larger and becomes weak for unknown reasons 
The strain can lead to heart swelling and eventual heart failure 
It can make it harder for the heart to pump blood 
Fluid buildup in the sac around the heart pericardial effusion 
Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction 
The strain can cause the heart muscle to grow larger and become weak 
High blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs pulmonary hypertension 
The heart has to work harder to move blood between the lungs and the heart 
The strain may lead to thickening or enlargement of the right side of the heart 
Iron can build up in various organs, including the heart 
This can cause the lower left heart chamber to swell 
Amyloid protein deposits in the heart cause an irreversible thickening of the heart wall 
The heart has to work harder to fill with blood 
In some athletes, the heart becomes enlarged as a response to frequent and prolonged exercise 
Usually, this type of enlarged heart isn t considered a disease and doesn t need treatment 
Some people have extra fat around the heart that can appear on a chest X ray 
Unless there are other heart conditions associated, no treatment is necessary 
Risk factors Things that can increase the risk of an enlarged heart cardiomegaly include 
This means having a blood pressure measurement higher than millimeters of mercury 
Heart failure may occur if the left lower heart chamber left ventricle becomes enlarged 
In heart failure, the heart can t pump the proper amount of blood throughout the body 
Blood clots may form in the lining of the heart 
If a clot blocks blood flow, you could have a heart attack or stroke 
The interrupted blood flow creates a sound called a heart murmur 
Although not necessarily harmful, heart murmurs should be monitored by a health care provider 
An enlarged heart may cause the heart to beat too fast or too slow 
The irregular heartbeat arrhythmia may lead to fainting, cardiac arrest or sudden death 
Monitor and manage high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes 
Overview Cardiomyopathy kahr dee o my OP uh thee is a disease of the heart muscle 
Cardiomyopathy also can lead to some other serious heart conditions 
Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgically implanted devices and heart surgery 
Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and how serious it is 
Shortness of breath or trouble breathing with activity or even at rest 
Swelling of the legs, ankles, feet, stomach area and neck veins 
In others, it might not become worse for a long time 
When to see a doctorSee your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of cardiomyopathy 
Some types of cardiomyopathy can be passed down through families 
Other people are born with cardiomyopathy because of a gene passed on from a parent 
Certain health conditions or behaviors that can lead to acquired cardiomyopathy include 
Certain infections, especially those that cause inflammation of the heart 
Lack of essential vitamins or minerals in the diet, such as thiamin vitamin B 
When this happens in the heart or lungs, it s called sarcoidosis 
The buildup of irregular proteins in the organs, called amyloidosis 
Use of some chemotherapy medicines and radiation to treat cancer 
In this type of cardiomyopathy, the heart s chambers thin and stretch, growing larger 
The condition tends to start in the heart s main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle 
As a result, the heart has trouble pumping blood to the rest of the body 
Conditions that can lead to a dilated heart include coronary artery disease and heart attack 
But for some people, gene changes play a role in the disease 
The condition mostly affects the muscle of the heart s main pumping chamber 
But it tends to be worse if it happens during childhood 
Most people with this type of cardiomyopathy have a family history of the disease 
In this type, the heart muscle becomes stiff and less flexible 
As a result, it can t expand and fill with blood between heartbeats 
This least common type of cardiomyopathy can happen at any age 
Restrictive cardiomyopathy can occur for no known reason, also called an idiopathic cause 
It mainly affects the muscle in the lower right heart chamber, called the right ventricle 
The muscle is replaced by fat that can become scarred 
Risk factors Many things can raise the risk of cardiomyopathy, including 
Family history of cardiomyopathy, heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest 
These include a past heart attack, coronary artery disease or an infection in the heart 
Illicit drug use, such as cocaine, amphetamines and anabolic steroids 
The growth of small patches of inflamed tissue in organs, called sarcoidosis 
The heart can t pump enough blood to meet the body s needs 
Because the heart can t pump well, blood clots might form in the heart 
This can cause blood to flow backward in the valve 
Sometimes, irregular heartbeats can cause sudden death if the heart stops beating effectively 
Let your healthcare professional know if you have a family history of the condition 
Stay away from alcohol or illegal drugs such as cocaine 
Control any other conditions you have, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes 
These healthy habits also can help people with inherited cardiomyopathy control their symptoms 
It typically starts in the heart s main pumping chamber left ventricle 
A person with dilated cardiomyopathy might not notice any symptoms at first 
Shortness of breath dyspnea during activity or while lying down 
Swelling edema in the legs, ankles, feet or belly abdomen 
If a family member has dilated cardiomyopathy, talk to your health care provider 
Some types of dilated cardiomyopathy run in families are inherited 
Causes It may be difficult to determine the cause of dilated cardiomyopathy 
However, many things can cause the left ventricle to dilate and weaken, including 
Heart valve disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve regurgitation 
Risk factors Risk factors for dilated cardiomyopathy include 
Damage to the heart muscle from certain diseases, such as hemochromatosis 
Family history of dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest 
Inflammation of the heart muscle from immune system disorders, such as lupus 
Cardiomyopathy may make it harder for heart valves to close 
Changes in the heart s size and shape can interfere with the heart s rhythm 
Dilated cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to suddenly stop beating 
Pooling of blood in the left lower heart chamber can lead to blood clots 
Blood clots can cause stroke, heart attack or damage to other organs 
PreventionHealthy lifestyle habits can help prevent or reduce complications of dilated cardiomyopathy 
Eat a healthy diet that is low in salt sodium 
The thickened heart muscle can make it harder for the heart to pump blood 
Many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy don t realize they have it 
Some people with HCM have changes in the heart s electrical system 
These changes can result in life threatening irregular heartbeats or sudden death 
SymptomsSymptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can include one or more of the following 
Fainting, especially during or just after exercise or other physical activity 
When to see a doctorMany conditions can cause shortness of breath and fast, pounding heartbeats 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically affects the wall between the two bottom chambers of the heart 
The thickened wall might block blood flow out of the heart 
If there s no significant blocking of blood flow, the condition is called nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
But the heart s main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, might stiffen 
Heart muscle cells also become arranged differently in people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
Risk factors Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually is passed down through families 
In many people, the thickened heart muscle blocks the blood flow leaving the heart 
This can cause shortness of breath with activity, chest pain, dizziness and fainting spells 
If it doesn t close properly, blood can leak backward into the left upper chamber 
The condition tends to start in the left lower heart chamber 
As a result, the heart can t pump enough blood to meet the body s needs 
An irregular heartbeat or blockage of blood flow can sometimes cause fainting 
Rarely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause heart related sudden death in people of all ages 
As a result, sudden cardiac death might be the first sign of the condition 
PreventionThere is no known way to prevent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HCM 
But not everyone with HCM has a gene change that tests can detect 
Echocardiograms use sound waves to make pictures of the heart 
For people who have a family member with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
Screening with echocardiograms should continue every to years through ages to 
After that, the screenings can be done every five years through adulthood 
Overview Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart 
Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices 
SymptomsHeart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease 
Cholesterol deposits plaques in the heart arteries are usually the cause of coronary artery disease 
Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body 
It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain angina or stroke 
Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women 
For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain 
Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort angina 
Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back 
It s important to watch for heart symptoms and discuss concerns with your health care provider 
Heart cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups 
Swelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes 
In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain 
Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood 
Symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren t immediately life threatening include 
They open and close to move blood through the heart 
A heart valve may become narrowed stenosis , leaky regurgitation or insufficiency or close improperly prolapse 
Depending on which valve isn t working properly, heart valve disease symptoms generally include 
When to see a doctorSeek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms 
Talk to your health care provider if you have any concerns about your heart health 
Together, you and your provider can discuss ways to reduce your heart disease risk 
This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease 
Causes Heart disease causes depend on the specific type of heart disease 
The valves open only one way and only when they need to 
Valves must open all the way and close tightly so there s no leakage 
HeartbeatsA beating heart squeezes contracts and relaxes in a continuous cycle 
During contraction systole , the lower heart chambers ventricles squeeze tight 
This action forces blood to the lungs and the rest of the body 
During relaxation diastole , the ventricles fill with blood from the upper heart chambers atria 
The heartbeat controls the continuous exchange of oxygen rich blood with oxygen poor blood 
Electrical signals start in the upper right chamber right atrium 
The signals travel through specialized pathways to the lower heart chambers ventricles 
Risk factors include a poor diet, lack of exercise, obesity and smoking 
Healthy lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of atherosclerosis 
Use of certain medications, including those bought without a prescription, and herbs and supplements 
A congenital heart defect forms as the baby s heart develops, about a month after conception 
Congenital heart defects change the flow of blood in the heart 
Some medical conditions, medications and genes increase the risk of congenital heart defects 
The cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown 
Dilated cardiomyopathy typically starts in the heart s main pumping chamber left ventricle 
Causes of heart valve diseaseMany things can cause diseases of the heart valves 
Some people are born with heart valve disease congenital heart valve disease 
Heart valve disease may also be caused by conditions such as 
Risk factors Risk factors for heart disease include 
Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers 
Diets high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol have been linked to heart disease 
Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause the arteries to become hard and thick 
These changes interrupt blood flow to the heart and body 
Obesity and high blood pressure increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease 
Unrelieved stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease 
It s important to brush and floss your teeth and gums often 
This is one of the most common complications of heart disease 
Heart failure occurs when the heart can t pump enough blood to meet the body s needs 
The risk factors that lead to heart disease can also lead to an ischemic stroke 
This type of stroke happens when the arteries to the brain are narrowed or blocked 
An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of an artery 
If an aneurysm bursts, you may have life threatening internal bleeding 
This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking claudication 
Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness 
It s usually due to a problem with the heart s electrical system 
If not treated immediately, it results in sudden cardiac death 
PreventionThe same lifestyle changes used to manage heart disease may also help prevent it 
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the U S 
The first sign of the condition might be a stroke or transient ischemic attack TIA 
A TIA is a temporary shortage of blood flow to the brain 
Treatment of carotid artery disease usually involves lifestyle changes, medicines and sometimes surgery 
SymptomsIn its early stages, carotid artery disease often doesn t have symptoms 
When to see a doctorSeek emergency care for any symptoms of a stroke 
Managing the risk factors might protect you from a stroke 
Plaques are clumps that include cholesterol, fat and blood cells that form in the artery 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of carotid artery disease include 
Too much pressure on artery walls can weaken them and make them easier to damage 
Arteries become less flexible and more likely to be injured with age 
Excess weight increases the chances of high blood pressure, atherosclerosis and diabetes 
Spells of stopping breathing at night might increase the risk of stroke 
Complications Carotid artery disease causes about to of strokes 
The piece of plaque can get stuck in one of these smaller arteries 
This blockage cuts off blood supply to part of the brain 
Some plaques are prone to cracking and forming irregular surfaces on the artery wall 
It sends blood cells that help the clotting process to the area 
PreventionThese steps can help prevent carotid artery disease or keep it from getting worse 
Focus on fruits and vegetables, whole grains and fish, nuts and legumes 
Too much salt can increase blood pressure in some people 
Experts recommend that healthy adults eat less than , milligrams of salt a day 
It also helps you lose weight, control diabetes and reduce stress 
Managing conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure helps protect arteries 
Overview Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common hand conditions 
Wrist anatomy, health conditions and possibly repetitive hand motions can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome 
Proper treatment usually relieves the tingling and numbness and restores hand function 
SymptomsSymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually start gradually and include 
Tingling and numbness may occur in the fingers or hand 
Usually the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers are affected, but not the little finger 
You might have a feeling like an electric shock in these fingers 
The sensation also can travel from the wrist up the arm 
Many people shake out their hands to try to relieve their symptoms 
People with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience weakness in the hand and drop objects 
Causes Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve 
This nerve also provides signals to move the muscles around the base of the thumb 
A wrist fracture can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve 
Many times, there is no single cause of carpal tunnel syndrome 
Risk factors Several factors have been linked with carpal tunnel syndrome 
A wrist fracture or dislocation can alter the space within the carpal tunnel 
People who have smaller carpal tunnels may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome 
Being obese is a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome 
Fluid retention may increase the pressure within the carpal tunnel, irritating the median nerve 
Carpal tunnel syndrome that happens with pregnancy generally gets better on its own after pregnancy 
However, computer use may cause a different form of hand pain 
If your work involves a cash register or keyboard, for instance, hit the keys softly 
Taking a break for even a few minutes each hour can make a difference 
Do not bend your wrist all the way up or down when using a keyboard 
A relaxed middle position with the wrists parallel to the floor is best 
This can cause neck pain and also may bother the hands and arms 
Make sure that your computer mouse is comfortable to use and doesn t strain your wrist 
Overview Childhood apraxia of speech CAS is a rare speech disorder 
Children with this disorder have trouble controlling their lips, jaws and tongues when speaking 
In CAS, the brain has trouble planning for speech movement 
The brain isn t able to properly direct the movements needed for speech 
The speech muscles aren t weak, but the muscles don t form words the right way 
SymptomsChildren with childhood apraxia of speech CAS may have a variety of speech symptoms 
Symptoms vary depending on a child s age and the severity of the speech problems 
Speaking first words late, typically after ages to months old 
These symptoms are usually noticed between ages months and years 
Suspected CAS means a child may potentially have this speech disorder 
The child s speech development should be watched to determine if therapy should begin 
Children usually produce more speech between ages and 
They also may have a hard time moving smoothly to the next sound 
Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS, which helps to make a diagnosis 
Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders 
Trouble moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another 
Vowel distortions, such as trying to use the correct vowel but saying it incorrectly 
Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying BUH NAN UH 
Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables 
These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria 
Unlike in CAS, the child doesn t have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak 
A child with CAS might say duh instead of duck or uh instead of up 
The child might say tun instead of sun or doo instead of zoo 
The child might say ting instead of string or fog instead of frog 
Dysarthria is a speech disorder that occurs because the speech muscles are weak 
People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice 
Causes Childhood apraxia of speech CAS has a number of possible causes 
There usually isn t an observable problem in the brain of a child with CAS 
However, CAS can be the result of brain conditions or injury 
These may include a stroke, infections or traumatic brain injury 
CAS also may occur as a symptom of a genetic disorder, syndrome or metabolic condition 
These problems aren t due to CAS, but they may be seen along with CAS 
Symptoms or problems that are often present along with CAS include 
Delays in intellectual and motor development and problems with reading, spelling and writing 
Trouble with gross and fine motor movement skills or coordination 
Most cataracts develop slowly and don t disturb eyesight early on 
At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help deal with cataracts 
But if impaired vision affects usual activities, cataract surgery might be needed 
As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens 
Proteins and fibers in the lens begin to break down 
Long term use of steroid medicines also may cause cataracts to develop 
The lens sits behind the colored part of your eye, called the iris 
This produces clear, sharp images on the back part of the eye, called the retina 
As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less clear and thicker 
A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens 
This prevents a sharply defined image from reaching your retina 
Cataracts usually happen in both eyes, but not always at the same rate 
The cataract in one eye may be worse than the other 
Cataracts affecting the center of the lens, called nuclear cataracts 
A nuclear cataract may even improve your reading vision for a short time 
Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens, called cortical cataracts 
Cataracts that affect the back of the lens, called posterior subcapsular cataracts 
These types of cataracts tend to grow faster than others 
Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood 
They also may be associated with an infection or trauma while in the womb 
These may include myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type or rubella 
If they do, they re usually removed soon after they re found 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include 
PreventionNo studies have proved how to prevent or slow the growth of cataracts 
But health care professionals think several strategies may be helpful, including 
Eye exams can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages 
Ask your health care team how often you should have an eye examination 
Ask a member of your health care team how to stop smoking 
Medicines, counseling and other strategies are available to help you 
Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables 
Adding fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you re getting many vitamins and nutrients 
Studies haven t proved that antioxidants in pill form can prevent cataracts 
Eating them is a safe way to get enough minerals and vitamins in your diet 
Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B rays when you re outdoors 
Drinking too much alcohol can increase the risk of cataracts 
They may be present in the brain or spinal cord 
CCMs can run in families, but most often they occur on their own 
CCMs are one of several types of brain vascular malformations, which contain abnormal blood vessels 
It s common to have both a DVA and a CCM 
CCMs may leak blood and lead to bleeding in the brain or spinal cord hemorrhage 
Brain hemorrhages can cause many signs and symptoms, such as seizures 
Seizures may occur when there is a CCM on the outer surface of the brain 
Neurological issues can progressively worsen over time with recurrent bleeding 
Repeat bleeding can happen soon after an initial bleed or much later 
They occur as a single formation without an apparent cause and without any family history 
A diagnosis of the inherited form can be confirmed by genetic testing 
Familial CCMs are inherited through a mutation in one of these genes 
It isn t fully understood why these mutations lead to CCM 
Bleeding is more likely to recur in people with prior diagnosed hemorrhages 
They re also more likely to happen again with malformations located in the brainstem 
Overview Cavities are areas in the hard surface of your teeth that are damaged 
Cavities and tooth decay are among the world s most common health problems 
But anyone who has teeth can get cavities, including babies 
If cavities aren t treated, they get larger and affect deeper layers of your teeth 
SymptomsThe symptoms of cavities vary, depending on how many you have and where they re located 
When a cavity is just beginning, you may not have any symptoms 
As the decay gets larger, it may cause symptoms such as 
Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold 
Holes or pits in your teeth that you can see 
Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth 
When to see a dentistYou may not be aware that a cavity is forming 
Dental plaque is a clear sticky film that coats your teeth 
Plaque that stays on your teeth can harden under or above your gumline into tartar 
Tartar makes plaque harder to remove and creates a shield for bacteria 
The acids from bacteria remove minerals in your tooth s hard, outer enamel 
Decay most often occurs in your back teeth your molars and premolars 
That s why they re harder to keep clean than your smoother, easy to reach front teeth 
It also can reverse the earliest stages of tooth damage 
Because of its benefits for teeth, fluoride is added to many public water supplies 
It s also a common ingredient in toothpaste and mouth rinses 
In the U S , cavities are common in very young children and teenagers 
Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away food and plaque from your teeth 
Substances found in saliva also help counter the acid produced by bacteria 
Over the years, dental fillings can weaken, begin to break down or get rough edges 
This allows plaque to build up more easily and makes it harder to remove 
Dental devices can stop fitting well, allowing decay to begin under them 
It can wear away the enamel of your teeth and cause a lot of damage 
This exposes more of the dentin to bacteria, creating tooth decay 
Anorexia and bulimia can lead to a lot of tooth erosion and cavities 
Eating disorders also can get in the way of saliva production 
Complications Cavities and tooth decay are so common that you may not take them seriously 
Pain that makes it hard to live your daily life 
Weight loss or nutrition problems because it s painful or difficult to eat or chew 
Tooth loss, which may affect your appearance, confidence and self esteem 
In rare cases, a tooth abscess, which can lead to more serious or even life threatening infections 
PreventionGood oral and dental hygiene can help keep you from getting cavities 
To clean between your teeth, floss or use an interdental cleaner 
This cleaner helps reach areas where a toothbrush can t reach 
Your dentist can recommend a schedule that s best for you 
A sealant is a protective plastic coating applied to the chewing surface of back teeth 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends sealants for all school age children 
Most public water supplies have added fluoride, which can reduce tooth decay greatly 
If you snack or drink throughout the day, your teeth are under constant attack 
Some foods and beverages are better for your teeth than others 
They may twist on themselves, cutting off their blood supply volvulus 
The air sacs alveoli inside the lungs don t develop as they should 
This results in problems with blood flow and increased pressure inside the lung s blood vessels 
Severe trouble breathing due to small lungs that don t work well pulmonary hypoplasia 
When to see a doctorCDH may be found during a routine fetal ultrasound 
Your health care provider can discuss treatment options with you 
Causes In most cases, the cause of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not known 
Complications Complications that can occur with CDH include 
Changes in the shape of the chest and curve of the spine 
Typically, the ligament runs across the largest blood vessel in the body aorta 
But sometimes the ligament or artery may be out of place, causing MALS 
Treatment involves surgery to release decompress the ligament and restore blood flow through the artery 
SymptomsOften, compression of the celiac artery doesn t cause any symptoms 
However, those with median arcuate ligament syndrome MALS can have long term chronic stomach pain 
Pain in the upper middle stomach area, which may go away when leaning forward 
When to see a doctorThere are many different causes of stomach pain 
If your stomach pain continues despite home care, call your health care provider 
You ll need a complete physical exam and tests to determine the specific cause 
Seek immediate medical help if your stomach pain occurs with 
Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes jaundice 
Sometimes upper stomach pain can be confused with chest pain 
Pain that lasts more than a few minutes or gets worse with activity 
Causes Doctors aren t exactly sure what causes median arcuate ligament syndrome 
The causes and diagnosis of MALS are a subject of controversy 
MALS has been seen in children, even twins, which might mean genetics plays a role 
The pain can lead to a fear of eating and significant weight loss 
The pain and related depression or anxiety can greatly impact quality of life 
MALS symptoms may be vague and can mimic other conditions 
It may take some time to get an accurate diagnosis 
Overview Celiac disease is an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten 
Gluten is a protein found in foods containing wheat, barley or rye 
The intestinal damage often causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating or anemia 
It also can lead to serious complications if it is not managed or treated 
In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms 
Anemia, usually from iron deficiency due to decreased iron absorption 
Loss of bone density, called osteoporosis, or softening of bones, called osteomalacia 
ChildrenChildren with celiac disease are more likely than adults to have digestive problems, including 
Neurological symptoms, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD , learning disabilities, headaches, lack of muscle coordination and seizures 
The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp or buttocks 
Be sure to consult your health care team before trying a gluten free diet 
Sometimes celiac disease becomes active after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection or severe emotional stress 
Villi absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat 
Risk factors Celiac disease tends to be more common in people who have 
Complications Celiac disease that is not treated can lead to 
This occurs if your small intestine can t absorb enough nutrients 
In children, malnutrition can cause slow growth and short stature 
In adults, it can lead to a loss of bone density, called osteopenia or osteoporosis 
Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D can contribute to reproductive issues 
Once your intestine has healed, you might be able to tolerate dairy products again 
Nonresponsive celiac disease is often due to contamination of the diet with gluten 
Working with a dietitian can help you learn how to avoid all gluten 
Truly refractory celiac disease that is not responding to a gluten free diet 
Medically proven treatment options are available as well, though results aren t immediate or long lasting 
It s sometimes described as having a cottage cheese or orange peel texture 
Risk factors Cellulite is much more common in women than in men 
Cellulite is also more common with aging, when the skin loses elasticity 
Weight gain can make cellulite more noticeable, but some lean people have cellulite, as well 
An inactive lifestyle also can increase your chances of having cellulite, as can pregnancy 
Cellulitis Overview Cellulitis sel u LIE tis is a common, potentially serious bacterial skin infection 
The infection happens when a break in the skin allows bacteria to enter 
You have a swollen, tender rash or a rash that s changing rapidly 
See your health care provider, preferably within the same day, if 
The incidence of a more serious staphylococcus infection called methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA is increasing 
Risk factors Several factors increase the risk of cellulitis 
Any cut, fracture, burn or scrape gives bacteria an entry point 
Having had cellulitis before increases the risk of getting it again 
Complications Untreated cellulitis might lead to bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, toxic shock syndrome or sepsis 
Rarely, the infection can spread to the deep layer of tissue called the fascial lining 
PreventionIf your cellulitis recurs, your health care provider may recommend preventive antibiotics 
For most surface wounds, a nonprescription ointment Vaseline, Polysporin, others provides adequate protection 
Irritation, pain and pus all signal possible infection and the need for medical care 
People with diabetes or poor circulation need to take extra precautions to prevent skin injury 
Regularly check your feet for signs of injury so that you can catch infections early 
Promptly treating infections on the skin s surface, such as athlete s foot 
Minor skin infections can easily spread from person to person 
There are several types of central nervous system vascular malformations, including 
These are unusual tangles of blood vessels that connect arteries and veins 
Most often they occur in or near the brain or the spine 
This type poses the highest risk of brain bleeds and other complications 
These are small blood vessels, called capillaries, that are wider than usual 
These are blood vessels in the brain or spinal cord that are formed unusually 
These are unusually enlarged veins in the brain or spinal cord 
SymptomsSymptoms depend on the type of central nervous system vascular malformation and where it s found 
Symptoms for some central nervous system vascular malformations can include 
Brain and nervous system problems, called neurological deficits, that get worse over time 
Neurological deficits can affect speech, vision, balance, memory and other abilities 
Causes The cause of central nervous system vascular malformations is unclear 
Some genetic conditions can increase the risk of having vascular malformation 
Injury to the central nervous system might be another cause 
Complications Central nervous system vascular malformations can damage the brain or spinal cord 
Damage can come from bleeding, called hemorrhage, into nearby tissues 
Once bleeding occurs, there s a greater risk of having another bleed 
For someone who has a vascular malformation, being pregnant might increase the risk of bleeding 
Central sleep apnea is less common than obstructive sleep apnea 
Central sleep apnea can result from other conditions, such as heart failure and stroke 
Causes Central sleep apnea occurs when your brain doesn t transmit signals to your breathing muscles 
The cause varies with the type of central sleep apnea you have 
During Cheyne Stokes breathing, breathing effort and airflow gradually rise and then lessen 
During the weakest breathing effort, a total lack of airflow can occur 
These medicines can be taken by mouth or by shot, also called injection 
They include morphine MS Contin, Mitigo, others , oxycodone Roxicodone, Oxycontin, others and codeine 
A Cheyne Stokes breathing pattern can occur if you re at a very high altitude 
It is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apneas 
Several medical conditions, including end stage kidney disease and stroke, may lead to central sleep apnea 
Primary central sleep apnea, also known as idiopathic sleep apnea 
The cause of this uncommon type of central sleep apnea is not known 
Risk factors Certain factors put you at increased risk of central sleep apnea 
Males are more likely to develop central sleep apnea than are females 
Central sleep apnea is more common among older adults, especially those older than age 
Heart problems put people at higher risk of central sleep apnea 
An irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation, can increase the risk 
Stroke, brain tumor or a structural problem with the brainstem 
These brain conditions can affect the brain s ability to regulate breathing 
High altitude sleep apnea resolves a few weeks after returning to a lower altitude 
Opioid medicines may increase the risk of central sleep apnea 
For some people, complex sleep apnea goes away with continued use of their CPAP device 
Other people may be treated with a different kind of positive airway pressure therapy 
The repeated awakenings associated with sleep apnea make restorative sleep impossible 
People with central sleep apnea often have severe fatigue, daytime drowsiness and irritability 
These parasites can t survive in people, so they soon die 
Swimmer s itch usually clears on its own within a few days 
SymptomsSwimmer s itch symptoms include an itchy rash that looks like pimples or blisters 
Usually the rash affects skin that s not covered by swimsuits, wetsuits or waders 
If you notice pus at the rash site, check with your health care provider 
You might be referred to a doctor who specializes in skin conditions dermatologist 
The parasites eggs get into the water through the animals waste 
The snails then release the parasites into the water, where they can infect humans 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of swimmer s itch include 
Forgetting to dry off with a towel after getting out of the water 
Also avoid being in marshy areas where snails are often found 
Rinse exposed skin with clean water right after leaving the water 
Overview Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement and posture 
It s caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain, most often before birth 
Symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years and vary from very mild to serious 
The cause of cerebral palsy and its effect on function vary from person to person 
Some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need assistance 
Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also might affect some people with cerebral palsy 
There is no cure, but treatments can help improve function 
General symptoms include trouble with movement and coordination, speech and eating, development, and other issues 
This is the most common movement condition related to cerebral palsy 
Variations in muscle tone, such as being either too stiff or too floppy 
People with cerebral palsy may walk on their toes or crouch down when they walk 
They also may have a scissors like walk with their knees crossing 
Or they may have a wide gait or a walk that s not steady 
Trouble with fine motor skills, such as buttoning clothes or picking up utensils 
Speech and eatingThese symptoms related to speech and eating may occur 
DevelopmentSome children with cerebral palsy have these symptoms related to development 
Delays in reaching motor skills milestones, such as sitting up or crawling 
Delayed growth, resulting in smaller size than would be expected 
Other symptomsDamage to the brain can contribute to other neurological symptoms, such as 
Mental health conditions, such as emotional conditions and behavior issues 
The brain condition causing cerebral palsy doesn t change with time 
However, as the child gets older, some symptoms might become more or less clear 
And muscle shortening and muscle rigidity can worsen if not treated aggressively 
Also see a health professional if your child has delays in development 
Inflammation triggered by infection or fever can damage the unborn baby s developing brain 
This is a bacterial infection that s usually spread by sexual contact 
This bacterial infection causes swelling in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord 
This viral infection also causes swelling in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord 
Jaundice appears as a yellowing of the skin and eyes 
The condition occurs when certain byproducts of used blood cells aren t filtered from the bloodstream 
Cerebral palsy risk increases with the number of babies sharing the uterus 
If one or more of the babies die, the survivors risk of cerebral palsy increases 
Babies born prematurely are at higher risk of cerebral palsy 
The earlier a baby is born, the greater the cerebral palsy risk 
Events during labor and delivery may increase the risk of cerebral palsy 
Contracture is muscle tissue shortening due to severe muscle tightening 
These can include a dislocated hip, a curved spine or other bone changes 
Some children or adults need a feeding tube to get enough nutrition 
People with cerebral palsy might have mental health conditions, such as depression 
Social isolation and the challenges of coping with disabilities can contribute to depression 
People with cerebral palsy may develop heart disease, lung disease and breathing conditions 
Trouble swallowing can result in respiratory issues, such as aspiration pneumonia 
Aspiration pneumonia happens when a child inhales food, drink, saliva or vomit into the lungs 
PreventionOften cerebral palsy can t be prevented, but you can reduce risks 
If you re pregnant or planning to become pregnant, take these steps to minimize pregnancy complications 
Getting vaccinated against diseases such as rubella might prevent an infection 
It s best to make sure you re fully vaccinated before getting pregnant 
Proper prenatal care can reduce health risks to you and your unborn baby 
Rarely, cerebral palsy can be caused by brain damage that occurs in childhood 
There are three layers that surround the spinal cord and brain 
When there is a hole or tear in the outermost layer, a CSF leak occurs 
There are two distinct types of CSF leaks spinal CSF leaks and cranial CSF leaks 
A spinal CSF leak occurs anywhere in the spinal column 
The most common symptom of a spinal CSF leak is a headache 
Some CSF leaks may heal with bed rest and other conservative treatment 
Spinal CSF leaksThe most common symptom of a spinal CSF leak is a headache 
Clear, watery drainage from one side of the nose or ear 
An epidural in the spine for pain relief, such as during labor and delivery 
Irregularities of the dura mater around the nerve roots in the spine 
Risk factors Risk factors for spinal CSF leaks include 
Having a previous surgery or procedure on or around the spine 
Complications If a cranial CSF leak is left untreated, complications may occur 
The blood increases pressure on brain cells and damages them 
Getting emergency medical help quickly can reduce brain damage and other stroke complications 
The good news is that fewer Americans die of stroke now than in the past 
Some treatments are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins 
Numbness, weakness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg 
The person can try to raise both arms over the head 
If one arm begins to fall, it may be a sign of a stroke 
Also, one side of the mouth may droop when trying to smile 
The person may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes 
A sudden, severe headache may be a symptom of a stroke 
Vomiting, dizziness and a change in consciousness may occur with the headache 
Someone having a stroke may stumble or lose balance or coordination 
If you see any of these signs, call or emergency medical help right away 
The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability 
An ischemic stroke is caused by a blocked artery in the brain 
It happens when the brain s blood vessels become narrowed or blocked 
Hemorrhagic strokeHemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures 
Bulges at weak spots in the blood vessel walls, known as aneurysms 
Protein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall 
An AVM is an irregular tangle of thin walled blood vessels 
A transient ischemic attack is sometimes known as a ministroke 
Seek emergency care even if you think you ve had a TIA 
Having a TIA increases your risk of having a stroke later 
Risk factors Many factors can increase the risk of stroke 
Personal or family history of stroke, heart attack or transient ischemic attack 
Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include 
Sex Men have a higher risk of stroke than do women 
Hormones Taking birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen can increase risk 
Complications A stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities 
You may become paralyzed on one side of the body 
A stroke might affect the muscles in the mouth and throat 
This can make it hard to talk clearly, swallow or eat 
You also may have trouble with language, including speaking or understanding speech, reading or writing 
Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss 
Others may have trouble thinking, reasoning, making judgments and understanding concepts 
People who have had strokes may have more trouble controlling their emotions 
They also may need help with grooming and daily chores 
If you ve had a stroke, these measures might help prevent another stroke 
The follow up care you receive in the hospital and afterward also may play a role 
Many stroke prevention strategies are the same as strategies to prevent heart disease 
Healthy lifestyle changes and medicines often are used to treat high blood pressure 
Lower the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in your diet 
Smoking raises the risk of stroke for smokers and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke 
If lifestyle factors aren t enough to control blood sugar, you may be prescribed diabetes medicine 
Aerobic exercise reduces the risk of stroke in many ways 
Moderate intensity activities can include walking, jogging, swimming and bicycling 
A small to moderate amount is about one drink a day 
Talk to your healthcare professional about what s appropriate for you 
Your healthcare professional may recommend a sleep study if you have symptoms of OSA 
Anti platelet medicines make these cells less sticky and less likely to clot 
Your healthcare professional can recommend the right dose of aspirin for you 
If you can t take aspirin, you may be prescribed clopidogrel alone 
Ticagrelor Brilinta is another anti platelet medicine that can be used for stroke prevention 
Heparin is a fast acting anticoagulant that may be used short term in the hospital 
Slower acting warfarin Jantoven may be used over a longer term 
You also need regular blood tests to monitor warfarin s effects 
These medicines include dabigatran Pradaxa , rivaroxaban Xarelto , apixaban Eliquis and edoxaban Savaysa 
These medicines also are associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to warfarin 
Earwax is a helpful and natural part of your body s defenses 
Wax removal is most safely done by a health care provider 
Your ear canal and eardrum are delicate and can be damaged easily 
Children usually have their ears checked as part of any medical exam 
At the opening, it s washed away or falls out as new wax replaces it 
This usually just pushes wax deeper into the ear, rather than removing it 
Cervical dystonia can also cause your head to uncontrollably tilt forward or backward 
Symptoms generally begin gradually and then reach a point where they don t get substantially worse 
The disorder sometimes resolves without treatment, but sustained remissions are uncommon 
In some people, the pain from cervical dystonia can be exhausting and disabling 
Causes In most people with cervical dystonia, the cause is unknown 
Some people who have cervical dystonia have a family history of the disorder 
Cervical dystonia is also sometimes linked to head, neck or shoulder injuries 
Risk factors Risk factors for cervical dystonia include 
Women are more likely to develop cervical dystonia than are men 
The most common locations include the face, jaw, arms and trunk 
This can cause tingling, numbness and weakness in the arms, hands, legs or feet 
More than of people older than age are affected by cervical spondylosis 
When symptoms do occur, they typically include pain and stiffness in the neck 
If the spinal cord or nerve roots become pinched, you might experience 
Tingling, numbness and weakness in the arms, hands, legs or feet 
Disks act like cushions between the vertebrae of the spine 
By the age of , most people s spinal disks begin drying out and shrinking 
As the disks become smaller, there is more bone on bone contact between the vertebrae 
Cracks also appear on the exterior of the spinal disks 
The soft interior of a disk can squeeze through these cracks 
Sometimes, it presses on the spinal cord and nerve roots 
These bone spurs can sometimes pinch the spinal cord and nerve roots 
Ligaments are cords of tissue that connect bone to bone 
Spinal ligaments can stiffen with age, making the neck less flexible 
Risk factors Risk factors for cervical spondylosis include 
Previous neck injuries appear to increase the risk of cervical spondylosis 
Some individuals in certain families will experience more of these changes over time 
Rarely, neck pain can be a symptom of a more serious problem 
Even minor things, such as reading in bed, can strain neck muscles 
As with other joints in the body, neck joints tend to wear with age 
Certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, meningitis or cancer, can cause neck pain 
PreventionMost neck pain is associated with poor posture combined with age related wear and tear 
To help prevent neck pain, keep your head centered over your spine 
Adjust your desk, chair and computer so that the monitor is at eye level 
Your head and neck should be aligned with your body 
However, it s also possible to have cervicitis and not experience any signs or symptoms 
Often, cervicitis results from a sexually transmitted infection, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea 
Successful treatment of cervicitis involves treating the underlying cause of the inflammation 
If you do have signs and symptoms, they may include 
Vaginal bleeding after sex, not associated with a menstrual period 
When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have 
Most often, the bacterial and viral infections that cause cervicitis are transmitted by sexual contact 
An allergy, either to contraceptive spermicides or to latex in condoms, may lead to cervicitis 
Risk factors You re at greater risk of cervicitis if you 
Cervicitis can also increase the risk of getting HIV from an infected sexual partner 
This damage is mostly in the arms and legs peripheral nerves 
Charcot Marie Tooth disease is also called hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 
You may also experience loss of sensation and muscle contractions, and difficulty walking 
Foot deformities such as hammertoes and high arches also are common 
Decreased sensation or a loss of feeling in your legs and feet 
The severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, even among family members 
Other mutations damage the protective coating that surrounds the nerve myelin sheath 
Both cause weaker messages to travel between your limbs and brain 
Other causes of neuropathies, such as diabetes, may cause symptoms similar to Charcot Marie Tooth disease 
These other conditions can also cause the symptoms of Charcot Marie Tooth disease to become worse 
Be sure to let your doctor know about all of the medications you re taking 
Complications Complications of Charcot Marie Tooth disease vary in severity from person to person 
Foot abnormalities and difficulty walking are usually the most serious problems 
This allows the hip joint to become partially or completely dislocated 
Most people with hip dysplasia are born with the condition 
In infants, you might notice that one leg is longer than the other 
During diaper changes, one hip may be less flexible than the other 
Sometimes, there might be a sensation of instability in the hip 
Factors that may reduce the amount of space in the womb include 
Hip dysplasia can also make the joint more likely to develop osteoarthritis 
This happens because of higher contact pressures over a smaller surface of the socket 
Substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs 
When you re addicted, you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes 
The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug 
As time passes, you may need larger doses of the drug to get high 
Soon you may need the drug just to feel good 
Attempts to stop drug use may cause intense cravings and make you feel physically ill 
Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts 
Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect 
Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended 
Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug 
Spending money on the drug, even though you can t afford it 
Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn t do, such as stealing 
Driving or doing other risky activities when you re under the influence of the drug 
Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug 
Possible signs that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include 
Neglected appearance lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks 
Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than natural or harmless products 
Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection 
Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts 
Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive 
These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death 
Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnoticsBarbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants 
Examples include prescription sleeping medicines such as zolpidem Ambien and zaleplon Sonata 
Larger than usual pupils, the black circles in the middle of the eyes 
Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose if snorting drugs 
Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs meth mouth 
Club drugsClub drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties 
Examples include methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also called MDMA, ecstasy or molly, and gamma hydroxybutyric acid, known as GHB 
Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include 
HallucinogensUse of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug 
The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide LSD and phencyclidine PCP 
Flashbacks, a reexperience of the hallucinations even years later 
A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings 
InhalantsSigns and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance 
Appearing under the influence of drugs, with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination 
Opioid painkillersOpioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically 
This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone, fentanyl and oxycodone 
Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include 
Lack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things 
The sooner you seek help, the greater your chances for a long term recovery 
You continue using the drug despite the harm it causes 
Your drug use has led to unsafe behavior, such as sharing needles or unprotected sex 
You think you may be having withdrawal symptoms after stopping drug use 
You can find these lines listed on the internet or in the phone book 
Has signs of a possible heart attack, such as chest pain or pressure 
Has any other troublesome physical or psychological reaction to use of the drug 
Causes Like many mental health disorders, several factors may contribute to development of drug addiction 
The addicting drug causes physical changes to some nerve cells neurons in your brain 
These changes can remain long after you stop using the drug 
Certain factors can affect the likelihood and speed of developing an addiction 
Smoking or injecting drugs can increase the potential for addiction 
Complications Drug use can have significant and damaging short term and long term effects 
GHB and flunitrazepam may cause sedation, confusion and memory loss 
At high doses, they can cause seizures, coma and death 
The danger increases when these drugs are taken with alcohol 
Other life changing complicationsDependence on drugs can create a number of dangerous and damaging complications, including 
Behavioral changes may cause relationship or family conflict and custody issues 
Drug use can cause declining performance at work, absenteeism and eventual loss of employment 
Drug use can negatively affect academic performance and motivation to excel in school 
Talk to your children about the risks of drug use and misuse 
Children of parents who misuse drugs are at greater risk of drug addiction 
Don t go back to the neighborhood where you used to get your drugs 
Chemo brain can also be called chemo fog, cancer related cognitive impairment or cognitive dysfunction 
Researchers are working to understand the memory changes that people with cancer experience 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of chemo brain may include the following 
Trouble with visual memory, such as recalling an image or list of words 
Medications for other cancer related signs and symptoms, such as pain medications 
Other medical conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, depression, anxiety and nutritional deficiency 
SymptomsChest pain can feel different depending on what s triggering the symptom 
Heart related chest painChest pain is often associated with heart disease 
Chest discomfort due to a heart attack or another heart problem may feel like 
Usually, chest pain is less likely due to a heart problem if it happens with 
A sour taste or a sensation of food reentering the mouth 
Pain that gets better or worse when you change body position 
Pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough 
Causes Chest pain has many possible causes, all of which need medical care 
This is chest pain caused by poor blood flow to the heart 
These plaques narrow the arteries and restrict the heart s blood supply, particularly during physical activity 
Angina can be the main symptom felt during a heart attack 
This life threatening condition involves the main artery leading from the heart, called the aorta 
This condition usually causes sharp pain that gets worse when breathing in or lying down 
Digestive causesChest pain can be caused by disorders of the digestive system, including 
Problems with the esophagus can make swallowing difficult and even painful 
Chronic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, may cause long term pain that affects the chest muscles 
A blood clot in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism 
This condition causes chest pain that gets worse when you breathe in or cough 
This condition affects the arteries carrying blood to the lungs 
Always seek medical help if you aren t sure of the cause of chest pain 
Pain caused by costochondritis might mimic that of a heart attack or other heart conditions 
Costochondritis is sometimes known as chest wall pain syndrome, costosternal syndrome or costosternal chondrodynia 
Sometimes, swelling accompanies the pain Tietze syndrome What causes costochondritis is unclear 
Worsens when taking a deep breath, coughing, sneezing or with any chest wall movement 
However, costochondritis might be associated with trauma, illness or physical strain, such as severe coughing 
Overview Chickenpox is an illness caused by the varicella zoster virus 
It brings on an itchy rash with small, fluid filled blisters 
Chickenpox used to be a widespread problem, but today the vaccine protects children from it 
Other symptoms that may appear to days before the rash include 
Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases 
Raised bumps called papules, which break out over a few days 
So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time 
And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over 
The disease is by and large mild in healthy children 
Often, chickenpox can be diagnosed with an exam of the rash and other symptoms 
To avoid infecting others in the waiting room, call ahead for an appointment 
Mention that you think you or your child may have chickenpox 
This might be a sign that the skin is infected with bacteria 
You live with people who ve never had chickenpox and haven t gotten the chickenpox vaccine yet 
Most people who have had chickenpox or have gotten the vaccine are immune to chickenpox 
If you ve been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder 
You may have fewer blisters and mild or no fever 
A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare 
But it can be serious and can lead to other health problem including 
Infected skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream caused by bacteria 
Dehydration, when the body runs too low on water and other fluids 
Toxic shock syndrome, a dangerous complication of some illnesses caused by bacteria 
Reye s syndrome, a disease that causes swelling in the brain and liver 
This can happen in children and teens who take aspirin during chickenpox 
Who s at risk People who are at higher risk of chickenpox complications include 
Newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine 
This includes children under age , who have not yet had the vaccine 
People with a chronic condition, such as asthma, who take medicine that calms immune response 
Chickenpox and shinglesIf you ve had chickenpox, you re at risk of a complication called shingles 
The varicella zoster virus stays in your nerve cells after the chickenpox rash goes away 
Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States 
Talk to your provider for more information on how well they prevent shingles 
PreventionThe chickenpox vaccine, also called the varicella vaccine, is the best way to prevent chickenpox 
Even if you get chickenpox after receiving the vaccine, your symptoms may be much milder 
It can be used in the United States to vaccinate people age or older 
ProQuad combines the chickenpox vaccine with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine 
It can be used in the United States for children ages to 
This is part of the routine vaccination schedule for children 
The doses should be given at least three months apart 
Talk to your health care provider for more information on how well they prevent chickenpox 
Other people also shouldn t get the vaccine, or they should wait 
Check with your health care provider about whether you should get the vaccine if you 
Have any kind of cancer or are getting cancer treatment with radiation or medicines 
Recently received blood from a donor or other blood products 
Talk to your provider if you re not sure whether you need the vaccine 
Is it safe and effective Parents often wonder whether vaccines are safe 
They include pain, redness, soreness and swelling at the site of the shot 
Rarely, you might get a rash at the site or a fever 
It s caused by exposure to damp air that s cold but not freezing 
Symptoms may show up a few hours after being in the cold 
You may get the symptoms each cold season for years 
Small, itchy areas on your skin, often on your feet or hands 
When to see a doctorSeek medical care for chilblains if you 
Have symptoms that are long lasting or go away then flare 
Have symptoms that aren t improving after two weeks of home care 
Aren t sure whether you were in below freezing temperatures, as you might have frostbite 
They may be an unusual reaction of your body to cold followed by rewarming 
Risk factors The following factors increase the risk of chilblains 
Wearing clothing and shoes that are tight or expose skin to the cold 
This condition is most common in females between the ages of and 
This condition is most common in people with a low body mass 
When you come in from the cold, rewarm the skin gradually 
Cover all exposed skin as completely as possible when going outside in cold weather 
Child abuse takes many forms, which often occur at the same time 
Child sexual abuse is any sexual activity with a child 
This can involve sexual contact, such as intentional sexual touching, oral genital contact or intercourse 
Emotional child abuse means injuring a child s self esteem or emotional well being 
If you suspect child abuse, report the abuse to the proper authorities 
SymptomsA child who s being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused 
That s why it s vital to watch for red flags, such as 
Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self confidence 
Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary 
Keep in mind that warning signs are just that warning signs 
The presence of warning signs doesn t necessarily mean that a child is being abused 
Unexplained injuries, such as bruises, broken bones fractures or burns 
Sexual behavior or knowledge that s inappropriate for the child s age 
Statements by the child that he or she was sexually abused 
Avoidance of certain situations, such as refusing to go to school or ride the bus 
A decrease in school performance or loss of interest in school 
Excessive weight with medical complications that are not being adequately addressed 
Parental behaviorSometimes a parent s demeanor or behavior sends red flags about child abuse 
Appears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child 
Offers conflicting or unconvincing explanations for a child s injuries or no explanation 
Risk factors Factors that may increase a person s risk of becoming abusive include 
A history of being abused or neglected as a child 
Physical or mental illness, such as depression or post traumatic stress disorder PTSD 
Family crisis or stress, including domestic violence and other marital conflicts, or single parenting 
A child in the family who is developmentally or physically disabled 
Health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease and cancer 
An acceptance that violence is a normal part of relationships 
The goal is to provide safe, stable, nurturing relationships for children 
Encourage your child to tell you if there s a problem 
If you feel overwhelmed or out of control, take a break 
Find out who s supervising your child for example, at a sleepover 
Make irregular, but frequent, unannounced visits to observe what s happening 
Don t allow substitutes for your usual child care provider if you don t know the substitute 
Put the computer in a common area of your home, not the child s bedroom 
Use the parental controls to restrict the types of websites your child can visit 
Consider it a red flag if your child is secretive about online activities 
Report online harassment or inappropriate senders to your service provider and local authorities, if necessary 
Meet the families in your neighborhood, including parents and children 
you can start by talking with your family health care provider 
If you re misusing alcohol or drugs, ask your health care provider about treatment options 
Overview Childhood obesity is a serious medical condition that affects children and adolescents 
Childhood obesity can also lead to poor self esteem and depression 
Treating and preventing childhood obesity helps protect your child s health now and in the future 
And children normally carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development 
This can help determine if your child s weight is in an unhealthy range 
But genetic and hormonal factors might play a role as well 
Personal, parental and family stress can increase a child s risk of obesity 
People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets 
Some prescription drugs can increase the risk of developing obesity 
They include prednisone, lithium, amitriptyline, paroxetine Paxil , gabapentin Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant and propranolol Inderal, Hemangeol 
Complications Childhood obesity often causes complications in a child s physical, social and emotional well being 
This chronic condition affects the way your child s body uses sugar glucose 
Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle increase the risk of type diabetes 
A poor diet can cause your child to develop one or both of these conditions 
Childhood obesity can cause pain and sometimes injuries in the hips, knees and back 
Social and emotional complicationsChildren who have obesity may experience teasing or bullying by their peers 
PreventionTo help prevent excess weight gain in your child, you can 
Make healthy eating and regular physical activity a family affair 
Everyone will benefit and no one will feel singled out 
Don t be discouraged if your child doesn t immediately like a new food 
It usually takes multiple exposures to a food to gain acceptance 
Some studies indicate that too little sleep may increase the risk of obesity 
Sleep deprivation can cause hormonal imbalances that lead to increased appetite 
That makes them easy to overlook, which is why regular screening is important 
Depending on a person s sexual activity, Chlamydia trachomatis can infect the eyes, throat or rectum 
Eye infections, called conjunctivitis, cause the inside of the eyelid to be red and irritated 
Also, see your doctor if you learn your sexual partner has chlamydia 
Your doctor will likely prescribe an antibiotic even if you have no symptoms 
Causes The Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium is most commonly spread through vaginal, oral and anal sex 
Risk factors Risk factors for chlamydia include 
Less use of health services to prevent and treat sexually transmitted infections 
That s because younger people are more likely to have more than one risk factor 
PID can damage the fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus, including the cervix 
A chlamydia infection can inflame the coiled tube located beside each testicle epididymis 
The infection can result in fever, scrotal pain and swelling 
Rarely, the chlamydia organism can spread to the prostate gland 
The pregnancy needs to be removed to prevent life threatening complications, such as a burst tube 
PreventionThe surest way to prevent chlamydia infection is to abstain from sexual activities 
Use a male latex condom or a female polyurethane condom during each sexual contact 
Condoms used properly during every sexual encounter reduce but don t eliminate the risk of infection 
Overview Primary sclerosing skluh ROHS ing cholangitis koh lan JIE tis is a disease of the bile ducts 
Bile ducts carry the digestive liquid bile from your liver to your small intestine 
In primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammation causes scars within the bile ducts 
These scars make the ducts hard and narrow and gradually cause serious liver damage 
In most people with primary sclerosing cholangitis, the disease progresses slowly 
Signs and symptoms that may appear as the disease progresses include 
A majority of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have one of these diseases 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease don t always appear at the same time, though 
In some cases, primary sclerosing cholangitis is present for years before inflammatory bowel disease occurs 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis include 
A large proportion of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have inflammatory bowel disease 
People with Northern European heritage have a higher risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis 
Complications Complications of primary sclerosing cholangitis may include 
Portal hypertension refers to high blood pressure in this vein 
Portal hypertension can cause fluid from the liver to leak into your abdominal cavity ascites 
Varices are weak veins and tend to bleed easily, which can be life threatening 
People with primary sclerosing cholangitis may experience thinning bones osteoporosis 
Your doctor may recommend a bone density exam to test for osteoporosis every few years 
Calcium and vitamin D supplements may be prescribed to help prevent bone loss 
The gallbladder holds a digestive fluid bile that s released into the small intestine 
In most cases, gallstones blocking the tube leading out of the gallbladder cause cholecystitis 
This results in a bile buildup that can cause inflammation 
Other causes of cholecystitis include bile duct problems, tumors, serious illness and certain infections 
Treatment for cholecystitis often involves surgery to remove the gallbladder 
Cholecystitis symptoms often occur after a meal, particularly a large or fatty one 
Most often, cholecystitis is the result of hard particles that develop in your gallbladder gallstones 
A tumor may prevent bile from draining out of your gallbladder properly 
Kinking or scarring of the bile ducts can also cause blockage 
Risk factors Having gallstones is the main risk factor for developing cholecystitis 
Complications If untreated, cholecystitis can lead to a number of serious complications, including 
If bile builds up within your gallbladder, causing cholecystitis, the bile may become infected 
Untreated cholecystitis can cause tissue in the gallbladder to die gangrene 
PreventionYou can reduce your risk of cholecystitis by taking the following steps to prevent gallstones 
To achieve a healthy weight, reduce calories and increase your physical activity 
Maintain a healthy weight by continuing to eat well and exercise 
Diets high in fat and low in fiber may increase the risk of gallstones 
To lower your risk, choose a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
Cholera Overview Cholera is a bacterial disease usually spread through contaminated water 
Left untreated, cholera can be fatal within hours, even in previously healthy people 
Modern sewage and water treatment have virtually eliminated cholera in industrialized countries 
But cholera still exists in Africa, Southeast Asia and Haiti 
Death from severe dehydration can be prevented with a simple and inexpensive rehydration solution 
Others develop more serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection 
Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours 
Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe 
A loss of or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration 
Electrolyte imbalanceAn electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as 
These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium 
This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration 
If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in minutes 
When to see a doctorThe risk of cholera is slight in industrialized nations 
If you develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with active cholera, see your doctor 
Severe dehydration is a medical emergency that requires immediate care 
Contaminated water supplies are the main source of cholera infection 
Contaminated public wells are frequent sources of large scale cholera outbreaks 
People living in crowded conditions without adequate sanitation are especially at risk 
You re at increased risk of cholera if you live with someone who has the disease 
People with cholera lose large quantities of minerals, including potassium, in their stools 
Very low potassium levels interfere with heart and nerve function and are life threatening 
Rub soapy, wet hands together for at least seconds before rinsing 
If soap and water aren t available, use an alcohol based hand sanitizer 
Drink only safe water, including bottled water or water you ve boiled or disinfected yourself 
Don t add ice to your drinks unless you made it yourself using safe water 
Eat food that s completely cooked and hot and avoid street vendor food, if possible 
Avoid sushi, as well as raw or improperly cooked fish and seafood of any kind 
Stay away from salads and fruits that can t be peeled, such as grapes and berries 
It is a liquid dose taken by mouth at least days before travel 
Contact your doctor or local office of public health for more information about these vaccines 
Even with the vaccine, it s important to take the above precautions to prevent cholera 
But more worrisome are the potential complications, especially for your baby 
SymptomsIntense itching is the main symptom of cholestasis of pregnancy 
The itching is most common during the third trimester of pregnancy but sometimes begins earlier 
It may feel worse as your due date gets near 
But once your baby arrives, the itchiness usually goes away within a few days 
Other less common signs and symptoms of cholestasis of pregnancy may include 
Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice 
Causes The exact cause of cholestasis of pregnancy is unclear 
Bile is the digestive fluid made in the liver that helps break down fats 
Instead of leaving the liver for the small intestine, bile builds up in the liver 
Pregnancy hormones, genetics and the environment may all play a role 
Pregnancy hormones rise the closer you get to your due date 
Certain gene changes have been identified that may be linked to cholestasis of pregnancy 
Although the exact environmental factors aren t clear, risk varies by geographic location and season 
History of liver damage or disease, including hepatitis C and gallbladder stones 
Pregnancy at an older age, such as years or older 
About to of females have it happen again 
In severe cases, the risk of recurrence may be as high as 
Complications may occur in the mom, but the developing baby is especially at risk 
In moms, the condition may temporarily affect the way the body absorbs fat 
In babies, the complications of cholestasis of pregnancy can be severe 
Meconium is the sticky, green substance that typically collects in the developing baby s intestines 
Meconium may pass into the amniotic fluid if a mom has cholestasis 
Death of the baby late in pregnancy before delivery, also called stillbirth 
PreventionThere is no known way to prevent cholestasis of pregnancy 
Chondrosarcoma happens most often in the pelvis, hip and shoulder 
More rarely, it can happen in the bones of the spine 
Most chondrosarcomas grow slowly and may not cause many signs and symptoms at first 
SymptomsChondrosarcoma tends to grow slowly, so it might not cause signs and symptoms at first 
When they occur, signs and symptoms of chondrosarcoma may include 
Weakness or bowel and bladder control problems, if the cancer presses on the spinal cord 
Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes mutations in its DNA 
A cell s DNA contains the instructions that tell it what to do 
In time, cells can break away and spread metastasize to other areas of the body 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of chondrosarcoma include 
Most of these cells go away by the time you re born or soon after 
But sometimes a few of these cells remain and, rarely, they can become cancerous 
A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of suspicious cells for laboratory testing 
Determining how the biopsy should be performed requires careful planning by the medical team 
Your care team may also involve experts in endocrinology, ophthalmology and rehabilitation, as needed 
Options may include surgery, radiation therapy, radiosurgery and targeted therapies 
It can also be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain 
If surgery isn t an option, radiation therapy may be recommended instead 
Radiosurgery can be used before or after surgery for chordoma 
If surgery isn t an option, radiosurgery may be recommended instead 
Targeted therapy uses drugs that focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells 
By attacking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die 
Special tools can be passed through the tube to remove the cancer 
If you re interested in trying these newer treatments, discuss the options with your doctor 
If the condition develops before age , it s called juvenile Huntington s disease 
When Huntington s develops early, symptoms are somewhat different and the disease may progress faster 
Medications are available to help manage the symptoms of Huntington s disease 
But treatments can t prevent the physical, mental and behavioral decline associated with the condition 
Which symptoms appear first varies greatly from person to person 
Lack of impulse control that can result in outbursts, acting without thinking and sexual promiscuity 
Psychiatric disordersThe most common psychiatric disorder associated with Huntington s disease is depression 
This isn t simply a reaction to receiving a diagnosis of Huntington s disease 
Obsessive compulsive disorder, a condition marked by recurrent, intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors 
Mania, which can cause elevated mood, overactivity, impulsive behavior and inflated self esteem 
Bipolar disorder, a condition with alternating episodes of depression and mania 
Problems that often present early in the course of the disease include 
Contracted and rigid muscles that affect gait especially in young children 
Causes Huntington s disease is caused by an inherited difference in a single gene 
Complications After Huntington s disease starts, a person s functional abilities gradually worsen over time 
The time from the first symptoms to death is often about to years 
Juvenile Huntington s disease usually results in death within years after symptoms develop 
The clinical depression associated with Huntington s disease may increase the risk of suicide 
These people may consider genetic testing and family planning options 
Another option for couples is in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic diagnosis 
This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid, also known as CSF 
As the cancer grows, it can cause too much CSF in the brain 
This can lead to symptoms such as irritability, nausea or vomiting, and headaches 
DiagnosisChoroid plexus carcinoma happens the most in children under years old 
Tests and procedures used to diagnose choroid plexus carcinoma include 
During this exam, your child s vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes are tested 
This can help show which part of the brain might be affected by the tumor 
Tests to create images of your child s brain may include MRI and CT 
An MRI also helps your child s health care team to plan the surgery 
Some choroid plexus carcinomas are linked to certain genetic changes passed down in families 
Ask your child s health care provider about genetic testing and counseling 
The goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer, when possible 
Sometimes a temporary drain is put in during surgery to drain more fluid 
Sometimes chemotherapy is done at the same time as radiation therapy 
Advanced technologies help treat the cancer effectively while sparing healthy tissues 
Radiation may be used after surgery, even if the entire tumor was successfully removed 
Chronic exertional compartment syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Chronic exertional compartment syndrome may respond to nonsurgical treatment and activity modification 
If nonsurgical treatment doesn t help, your doctor might recommend surgery 
Surgery is successful for many people and might allow you to return to your sport 
Aching, burning or cramping pain in a compartment of the affected limb 
Occasionally, swelling or bulging as a result of a muscle hernia 
Pain caused by chronic exertional compartment syndrome typically follows this pattern 
Becomes less intense or stops completely within minutes of stopping the activity 
Once you take up running again, for instance, those familiar symptoms usually come back 
Causes The cause of chronic exertional compartment syndrome isn t completely understood 
Risk factors Certain factors increase your risk of developing chronic exertional compartment syndrome, including 
Repetitive impact activity such as running increases your risk of developing the condition 
A chronic cough can interrupt your sleep and leave you feeling exhausted 
Severe cases of chronic cough can cause vomiting, lightheadedness and even rib fractures 
Fortunately, chronic cough typically disappears once the underlying problem is treated 
SymptomsA chronic cough can occur with other signs and symptoms, which may include 
A feeling of liquid running down the back of your throat postnasal drip 
However, a cough that persists for weeks is usually the result of a medical problem 
This condition is also called upper airway cough syndrome UACS 
In one type of asthma cough variant asthma , a cough is the main symptom 
The coughing, in turn, worsens GERD a vicious cycle 
Chronic bronchitis can cause a cough that brings up colored sputum 
Emphysema causes shortness of breath and damages the air sacs in the lungs alveoli 
Bronchiolitis inflammation of the very small airways of the lung 
Sarcoidosis collections of inflammatory cells in different parts of your body, most commonly the lungs 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis chronic scarring of the lungs due to an unknown cause 
Frequent exposure to secondhand smoke also can lead to coughing and lung damage 
Rather than a specific headache type, chronic daily headaches include a variety of headache subtypes 
Chronic refers to how often the headaches occur and how long the condition lasts 
Aggressive initial treatment and steady, long term management might reduce pain and lead to fewer headaches 
True primary chronic daily headaches aren t caused by another condition 
Chronic migraineThis type typically occurs in people with a history of episodic migraines 
Cause pain that feels pressing or tightening, but not pulsating 
New daily persistent headacheThese headaches come on suddenly, usually in people without a headache history 
They become constant within three days of your first headache 
Cause pain that feels like pressing or tightening, but not pulsating 
Might have features of chronic migraine or chronic tension type headache 
In addition, hemicrania continua headaches are associated with at least one of the following 
Tearing or redness of the eye on the affected side 
When to see a doctorOccasional headaches are common, and usually require no medical attention 
You take a pain reliever for your headaches most days 
You need more than the recommended dose of over the counter pain remedies to relieve your headaches 
Accompanies a fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizure, double vision, weakness, numbness or difficulty speaking 
Causes The causes of many chronic daily headaches aren t well understood 
True primary chronic daily headaches don t have an identifiable underlying cause 
Inflammation or other problems with the blood vessels in and around the brain, including stroke 
Risk factors Factors associated with developing frequent headaches include 
PreventionTaking care of yourself might help ease chronic daily headaches 
The average adult needs seven to eight hours of sleep a night 
It s best to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day 
Talk to your doctor if you have sleep disturbances, such as snoring 
Avoid food or drinks, such as those containing caffeine, that seem to trigger headaches 
Regular aerobic physical activity can improve your physical and mental well being and reduce stress 
With your doctor s OK, choose activities you enjoy such as walking, swimming or cycling 
Try stress reduction techniques, such as yoga, tai chi or meditation 
Overview Myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome ME CFS is a complicated disorder 
It causes extreme fatigue that lasts for at least six months 
Symptoms worsen with physical or mental activity but don t fully improve with rest 
The cause of ME CFS is unknown, although there are many theories 
Experts believe it might be triggered by a combination of factors 
When to see a doctorFatigue can be a symptom of many illnesses 
In general, see your doctor if you have persistent or excessive fatigue 
Causes The cause of myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome ME CFS is still unknown 
Some people develop ME CFS symptoms after getting better from a viral or bacterial infection 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of ME CFS include 
ME CFS can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young to middle aged adults 
They also may develop clusters of white blood cells in infected areas 
SymptomsPeople with chronic granulomatous disease experience serious bacterial or fungal infection every few years 
Skin irritation that may include a rash, swelling or redness 
Causes A change in one of five genes can cause CGD 
People with CGD inherit the changed gene from a parent 
The enzyme is also active in immune cells that help your body heal 
When there are changes to one of these genes, the protective proteins are not produced 
Some people with CGD don t have one of these changed genes 
In these cases, health care providers don t know what causes the condition 
Risk factors Boys are more likely to have CGD 
These welts appear and fade at random as the reaction runs its course 
Chronic hives can be very uncomfortable and interfere with sleep and daily activities 
Batches of welts wheals that can arise anywhere on the body 
Welts that might be red, purple or skin colored, depending on your skin color 
Welts that vary in size, change shape, and appear and fade repeatedly 
If you get hives as part of a severe allergic reaction, seek emergency care 
Medical conditions, such as thyroid disease, infection, allergy and cancer 
Complications Chronic hives don t put you at sudden risk of a serious allergic reaction anaphylaxis 
If you do get hives as part of a severe allergic reaction, seek emergency care 
In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms 
You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced 
But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly 
Depending on how severe it is, loss of kidney function can cause 
Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs 
Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart 
This means they can also be caused by other illnesses 
Early detection might help prevent kidney disease from progressing to kidney failure 
Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you 
Glomerulonephritis gloe mer u low nuh FRY tis , an inflammation of the kidney s filtering units glomeruli 
Interstitial nephritis in tur STISH ul nuh FRY tis , an inflammation of the kidney s tubules and surrounding structures 
Vesicoureteral ves ih koe yoo REE tur ul reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include 
Complications Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body 
Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures 
Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection 
Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart pericardium 
Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus 
Taking too many pain relievers for a long time could lead to kidney damage 
Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse 
If you re a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting 
Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop 
Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage 
Hashimoto s disease Overview Hashimoto s disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid gland 
The thyroid produces hormones that help regulate many functions in the body 
An autoimmune disorder is an illness caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissues 
In Hashimoto s disease, immune system cells lead to the death of the thyroid s hormone producing cells 
Hashimoto s disease is also known as Hashimoto s thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis 
You may not notice signs or symptoms of the disease 
Eventually, the decline in thyroid hormone production can result in any of the following 
The immune system wrongly enlists disease fighting agents that damage cells and lead to cell death 
What causes the immune system to attack thyroid cells is not clear 
Risk factors The following factors are associated with an increased risk of Hashimoto s disease 
Hashimoto s disease can occur at any age but more commonly occurs during middle age 
People exposed to excessive levels of environmental radiation are more prone to Hashimoto s disease 
Complications Thyroid hormones are essential for the healthy function of many body systems 
Therefore, when Hashimoto s disease and hypothyroidism are left untreated, many complications can occur 
Hypothyroidism can result in poor heart function, an enlarged heart and irregular heartbeats 
Men with hypothyroidism may have a reduced libido, erectile dysfunction and a lowered sperm count 
Hypothyroidism during pregnancy may increase the risk of a miscarriage or preterm birth 
This rare, life threatening condition can develop due to long term, severe, untreated hypothyroidism 
Its signs and symptoms include drowsiness followed by profound lethargy and unconsciousness 
Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus sputum production and wheezing 
Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD 
These two conditions usually occur together and can vary in severity among individuals with COPD 
Although COPD is a progressive disease that gets worse over time, COPD is treatable 
Causes The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking 
They may be misdiagnosed as having COPD until a more thorough evaluation is performed 
The air sacs have very thin walls full of tiny blood vessels capillaries 
Causes of airway obstruction Causes of airway obstruction include 
This lung disease causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli 
Small airways collapse when you exhale, impairing airflow out of your lungs 
You develop a chronic cough trying to clear your airways 
Alpha antitrypsin deficiency can cause liver disease, lung disease or both 
Risk factors Risk factors for COPD include 
The most significant risk factor for COPD is long term cigarette smoking 
The more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke, the greater your risk 
Asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease, may be a risk factor for developing COPD 
The combination of asthma and smoking increases the risk of COPD even more 
The uncommon genetic disorder alpha antitrypsin deficiency is the cause of some cases of COPD 
Other genetic factors likely make certain smokers more susceptible to the disease 
People with COPD are more likely to catch colds, the flu and pneumonia 
People with COPD have a higher risk of developing lung cancer 
Difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy 
And dealing with serious illness can contribute to the development of depression 
It s critical to find a tobacco cessation program that can help you quit for good 
It s your best chance for reducing damage to your lungs 
Occupational exposure to chemical fumes and dusts is another risk factor for COPD 
Here are some steps you can take to help prevent complications associated with COPD 
Quit smoking to help reduce your risk of heart disease and lung cancer 
But tests may not be able to find a cause for chronic pelvic pain 
In that case, the goal of treatment is to ease pain and other symptoms 
You might describe the pain in one or more of the following ways 
Or it may be so intense that you miss work and can t sleep or exercise 
Sometimes, tests may find that a single disease is the cause 
In other cases, the pain may stem from more than one medical condition 
These growths inside, on or attached to the uterus aren t cancer 
It s linked with pain in the bladder that keeps coming back 
The pain may get better for a while after you empty your bladder 
Enlarged, varicose type veins around the uterus and ovaries can lead to pelvic pain 
Risk factors Many conditions are linked to chronic pelvic pain 
A history of sexual or physical abuse also may raise the risk 
The condition lasts weeks or longer, even with treatment 
The area around the eyes might feel swollen or tender 
Thick, discolored mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose 
Mucus down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip 
Pain, tenderness and swelling around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead 
But acute sinusitis is a short lived infection of the sinuses often linked to a cold 
The symptoms of chronic sinusitis last at least weeks 
There might be many bouts of acute sinusitis before it becomes chronic sinusitis 
When to see a doctorSchedule an appointment with your health care provider for 
Repeated sinusitis, and if the condition doesn t get better with treatment 
Causes The cause of chronic sinusitis usually is not known 
Some medical conditions, including cystic fibrosis, can cause chronic sinusitis in children and teens 
A common cold or other infection that affects the sinuses 
Risk factors The following factors raise the risk of getting chronic sinusitis 
Other serious infections can spread to the bones, called osteomyelitis, or to skin, called cellulitis 
PreventionTake these steps to lower the risk of getting chronic sinusitis 
Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before meals 
Overview Chronic traumatic encephalopathy CTE is a brain disorder likely caused by repeated head injuries 
It causes the death of nerve cells in the brain, known as degeneration 
CTE is a rare disorder that is not yet well understood 
CTE doesn t appear to be related to a single head injury 
It s related to repeated head injuries, often occurring in contact sports or military combat 
It also may occur in military members who were exposed to explosive blasts 
It s thought that these develop years to decades after head trauma occurs 
CTE can t be definitively diagnosed during life except in people with high risk exposures 
Researchers are currently developing diagnostic biomarkers for CTE, but none has been validated yet 
When the symptoms associated with CTE occur, health care providers may diagnose traumatic encephalopathy syndrome 
SymptomsThere are no specific symptoms that have been clearly linked to CTE 
Some of the possible symptoms can occur in many other conditions 
Parkinsonism, which causes shaking, slow movement and trouble with speech 
Motor neuron disease, which destroys cells that control walking, speaking, swallowing and breathing 
Experts believe that they develop over years or decades after repeated head trauma 
Experts also believe that CTE symptoms appear in two forms 
Symptoms of this form include depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior and aggression 
These symptoms include memory and thinking problems that are likely to progress to dementia 
Research shows that people with CTE may be at increased risk of suicide 
If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call or your local emergency number 
Depending on the symptoms, your or your child s provider may recommend seeking immediate medical care 
See your health care provider if you have concerns about your memory 
Also see your provider if you experience other thinking or behavior problems 
See your health care provider if you experience depression, anxiety, aggression or impulsive behavior 
Causes Repeated head trauma is likely the cause of CTE 
CTE is thought to cause areas of the brain to waste away, known as atrophy 
This happens because injuries to nerve cells that conduct electrical impulses affect communication between cells 
But CTE may be prevented because it s associated with recurrent concussions 
People who have had one concussion are more likely to have another head injury 
It lasts at least three months and has no clear cause 
And your care team might be able to find a cause for your pain 
How often the symptoms happen and where exactly they re felt varies from person to person 
Your pain might be constant, or it may come and go 
It might flare up only when the vulva is touched 
This is known as localized vulvodynia, and it s more common than the generalized kind 
The tissue of the vulva might look slightly inflamed or swollen 
If you don t have a gynecologist, you might be referred to one 
Injury to or irritation of the nerves of the vulva 
Muscle spasm or weakness in the pelvic floor, which supports the uterus, bladder and bowel 
Complications Without treatment, vulvodynia can affect mental health, relationships and other aspects of your life 
It s also tied to less sexual desire, arousal and enjoyment 
The liver damage caused by cirrhosis generally can t be undone 
SymptomsCirrhosis often has no symptoms until liver damage is severe 
Clubbing of the fingers, in which the fingertips spread out and become rounder than usual 
For women, absence of or loss of periods not related to menopause 
For men, loss of sex drive, testicular shrinkage or breast enlargement, known as gynecomastia 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which fat accumulates in the liver 
Hemochromatosis, a condition that causes iron buildup in the body 
Autoimmune hepatitis, which is a liver disease caused by the body s immune system 
Destruction of the bile ducts caused by primary biliary cholangitis 
Hardening and scarring of the bile ducts caused by primary sclerosing cholangitis 
Wilson s disease, a condition in which copper accumulates in the liver 
Poorly formed bile ducts, a condition known as biliary atresia 
Inherited disorders of sugar metabolism, such as galactosemia or glycogen storage disease 
High blood pressure in the veins that supply the liver 
Cirrhosis slows the regular flow of blood through the liver 
This increases pressure in the vein that brings blood to the liver 
Portal hypertension can cause the spleen to trap white blood cells and platelets 
This makes the spleen swell, a condition known as splenomegaly 
Portal hypertension can cause blood to be redirected to smaller veins 
Strained by the extra pressure, these smaller veins can burst, causing serious bleeding 
If the liver can t make enough clotting factors, this also can contribute to continued bleeding 
If you have cirrhosis, your body may have a hard time fighting infections 
With time, hepatic encephalopathy can progress to unresponsiveness or coma 
Jaundice causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes and darkening of urine 
Some people with cirrhosis lose bone strength and are at greater risk of fractures 
A large proportion of people who develop liver cancer have pre existing cirrhosis 
Researchers now believe this is a complication in some people who have cirrhosis 
PreventionLower your risk of cirrhosis by taking these steps to care for your liver 
If you have liver disease, you should not drink alcohol 
Cut down on the amount of fatty and fried foods you eat 
It belongs to a group of human and animal diseases known as prion disorders 
Symptoms of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease can be similar to those of Alzheimer s disease 
But Creutzfeldt Jakob disease usually gets worse much faster and leads to death 
They developed variant CJ, known as vCJD, after eating meat from diseased cattle 
However, most cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease haven t been linked to eating beef 
All types of CJD are serious but are very rare 
Symptoms get worse quickly, usually within several weeks to a few months 
People with Creutzfeldt Jakob disease usually die of medical issues associated with the disease 
Symptoms of dementia include the loss of the ability to think, reason and remember 
Variant CJD affects people at a younger age than CJD 
Another rare form of prion disease is called variably protease sensitive prionopathy VPSPr 
It causes changes in mental abilities and problems with speech and thinking 
The course of the disease is longer than other prion diseases about months 
But when they encounter infectious prions, they fold and become another shape that s not typical 
How Creutzfeldt Jakob disease developsThe risk of getting CJD is low 
It also can t be spread by touching or sexual contact 
Most people with Creutzfeldt Jakob disease develop the disease for no apparent reason 
This type, called spontaneous CJD or sporadic CJD, accounts for most cases 
Fewer than of people with CJD have a family history 
They may test positive for genetic changes associated with the disease 
This causes an inability to sleep and changes in memory and thinking 
A small number of people have developed CJD as a result of medical procedures 
These procedures included injections of pituitary human growth hormone from an infected source 
They also included cornea and skin transplants from people who had CJD 
Medical centers have changed their procedures to eliminate these risks 
Also, a few people have developed Creutzfeldt Jakob disease after brain surgery with contaminated instruments 
This happened because standard cleaning methods don t destroy the prions that cause the disease 
Today instruments that may have been contaminated with CJD are destroyed 
Cases related to medical procedures are referred to as iatrogenic CJD 
A small number of people have developed variant CJD from eating contaminated beef 
Variant CJD is linked to eating beef from cattle infected with mad cow disease 
Mad cow disease is known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE 
Risk factors Most cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease occur for unknown reasons 
But a few factors seem to be associated with different kinds of CJD 
Sporadic CJD tends to develop later in life, usually around age 
People with familial CJD have genetic changes that cause the disease 
People who ve received infected human growth hormone may be at risk of iatrogenic CJD 
In countries that have implemented effective public health measures, the risk is virtually nonexistent 
Chronic wasting disease CWD is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, reindeer and moose 
It has been found in some areas of North America 
To date, no documented cases of chronic wasting disease CWD have caused disease in humans 
Complications Creutzfeldt Jakob disease has serious effects on the brain and body 
Over time, people with CJD withdraw from friends and family 
This is used instead of taking the hormone from human pituitary glands 
Destroying surgical instruments that may have been exposed to CJD 
Single use kits for spinal taps, also known as lumbar punctures 
Have a blood relative who has been diagnosed with familial CJD 
CJD incidence peaked in the U K between and and has been declining since 
Tight restrictions on importing cattle from countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE is common 
Restrictions on which parts of cattle can be processed for food 
Claudication Overview Claudication is pain caused by too little blood flow to muscles during exercise 
The condition is also called intermittent claudication because the pain usually isn t constant 
As claudication worsens, however, the pain may occur during rest 
Pain, ache, discomfort or fatigue in muscles every time those muscles are used 
Signs or symptoms of peripheral artery disease, usually in more advanced stages, include 
Claudication can lead to a cycle that results in worsening cardiovascular health 
Pain may make exercise intolerable, and a lack of exercise results in poorer health 
Causes Claudication is most often a symptom of peripheral artery disease 
The peripheral arteries are the large vessels that deliver blood to the legs and arms 
When you re at rest, the limited blood flow is generally enough 
The plaque can cause the arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow 
Risk factors Potential risk factors for peripheral artery disease and claudication include 
A family history of atherosclerosis, peripheral artery disease or claudication 
Age older than years if you also smoke or have diabetes 
Obesity a body mass index, or body mass index BMI , over 
Other complications of peripheral artery disease due to atherosclerosis include 
If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar in good control 
Cleft lip and cleft palate are among the most common birth defects 
SymptomsUsually, a split cleft in the lip or palate is immediately identifiable at birth 
Difficulty swallowing, with potential for liquids or foods to come out the nose 
Males are more likely to have a cleft lip with or without cleft palate 
Cleft palate without cleft lip is more common in females 
One of the most immediate concerns after birth is feeding 
While most babies with cleft lip can breast feed, a cleft palate may make sucking difficult 
If the cleft extends through the upper gum, tooth development may be affected 
Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both 
SymptomsAlthough depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes 
During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include 
Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort 
Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain 
Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self blame 
Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide 
Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why 
Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as 
As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as 
People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains 
The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes 
Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression 
Changes in the body s balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression 
Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this condition 
Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression 
Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include 
Certain personality traits, such as low self esteem and being too dependent, self critical or pessimistic 
Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide 
Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain or heart disease 
Excess weight or obesity, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes 
Take steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and boost your self esteem 
Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening 
Consider getting long term maintenance treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms 
In clubfoot, the tissues connecting the muscles to the bone tendons are shorter than usual 
About half of children with clubfoot have it in both feet 
SymptomsIf your child has clubfoot, here s what it might look like 
The calf muscles in the affected leg are usually underdeveloped 
Despite its look, clubfoot itself doesn t cause any discomfort or pain 
Risk factors Boys are about twice as likely to develop clubfoot than girls are 
Smoking during pregnancy can significantly increase the baby s risk of clubfoot 
Complications Clubfoot typically doesn t cause any problems until your child starts to stand and walk 
If the clubfoot is treated, your child will most likely walk fairly normally 
PreventionBecause doctors don t know what causes clubfoot, you can t completely prevent it 
Overview Cluster headache is a very painful type of headache 
It usually occurs in periods of frequent attacks known as clusters 
Treatments can shorten cluster headache attacks and lessen the pain 
But some people might first have migraine like nausea and aura 
Extreme sharp or stabbing pain, usually in, behind or around one eye 
The pain can spread to other areas of the face, head and neck 
Pain on one side of the head in a single cluster 
Pain can switch to the other side in another cluster 
Skin color changes on the side of the face that hurts 
Cluster periodsA cluster period usually lasts for several weeks to months 
Cluster periods might go on for more than a year 
If a cluster period lasts a year without letup, it s called chronic cluster headache 
Headaches usually come every day, often several times a day 
The attacks often occur at the same time each day 
Most attacks occur at night, usually to hours after bedtime 
Your provider can rule out other illnesses and suggest treatment 
Even bad headache pain isn t usually the result of another disease 
Seek emergency care if you have any of these symptoms 
These might point to a stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, a brain tumor or other problems 
A headache that worsens over days and changes in pattern 
Risk factors Risk factors for cluster headache include 
Men are more likely to have cluster headaches than women are 
Most people who develop cluster headaches are between ages and 
Having a parent, brother or sister who has cluster headache might increase the risk 
Valley fever Overview Valley fever is a fungal infection caused by coccidioides kok sid e OY deze organisms 
It can cause signs and symptoms such as a fever, cough and tiredness 
These fungi are commonly found in soil in specific regions 
The fungi can cause valley fever, also known as acute coccidioidomycosis kok sid e oy doh my KOH sis 
Mild cases of valley fever usually resolve on their own 
In more severe cases, doctors treat the infection with antifungal medications 
Signs and symptoms occur one to three weeks after exposure 
Red, spotty rash, mainly on lower legs but sometimes on the chest, arms and back 
The nodules typically don t cause problems, but they can look like cancer on X rays 
If you develop symptoms, especially severe ones, the course of the disease is highly variable 
This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems 
coccidioidomycosisThe most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, is uncommon 
Meningitis an infection of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord 
Live in or have recently traveled to an area where this disease is common 
Causes Valley fever is caused by a person inhaling spores of certain fungi 
The fungi can also often be found in northern Mexico and Central and South America 
Like many other fungi, coccidioides species have a complex life cycle 
The spores are extremely small and can be carried far by the wind 
Once inside the lungs, the spores reproduce, continuing the disease cycle 
Risk factors Risk factors for valley fever include 
Anyone who inhales the spores that cause valley fever is at risk of infection 
New mothers are vulnerable right after their babies are born 
Anyone with a weakened immune system is at increased risk of serious complications 
People with diabetes may have a higher risk of severe lung infections 
A small percentage of people develop thin walled nodules cavities in their lungs 
This is the most serious complication of coccidioidomycosis but it s uncommon 
Affected skin develops itchy welts hives People with cold urticaria experience widely different symptoms 
Some have minor reactions to the cold, while others have severe reactions 
If you think you have this condition, consult your doctor 
Treatment usually includes preventive steps such as taking antihistamines and avoiding cold air and water 
Temporary itchy welts hives on the area of skin that was exposed to cold 
Swelling of the tongue and throat, which can make it difficult to breathe 
Damp and windy conditions may make a flare of symptoms more likely 
The worst reactions generally occur with full skin exposure, such as swimming in cold water 
Such a reaction could lead to loss of consciousness and drowning 
When to see a doctorIf you have skin reactions after cold exposure, see your doctor 
These chemicals cause hives and sometimes a whole body systemic reaction 
Risk factors You re more likely to have this condition if 
This familial type causes painful welts and flu like symptoms after exposure to cold 
PreventionThe following tips may help prevent a recurrent episode of cold urticaria 
Protect your skin from the cold or sudden changes in temperature 
Avoid ice cold drinks and food to prevent swelling of your throat 
If you re scheduled for surgery, talk with your surgeon beforehand about your cold urticaria 
The surgical team can take steps to help prevent cold induced symptoms in the operating room 
Hypothermia hi poe THUR me uh occurs as your body temperature falls below F C 
When your body temperature drops, your heart, nervous system and other organs can t work normally 
Hypothermia is often caused by exposure to cold weather or immersion in cold water 
Primary treatments for hypothermia are methods to warm the body back to a normal temperature 
While you wait for emergency help to arrive, gently move the person inside if possible 
Carefully remove his or her wet clothing, replacing it with warm, dry coats or blankets 
Causes Hypothermia occurs when your body loses heat faster than it produces it 
The most common causes of hypothermia are exposure to cold weather conditions or cold water 
Being unable to get out of wet clothes or move to a warm, dry location 
How your body loses heatThe mechanisms of heat loss from your body include the following 
Most heat loss is due to heat radiated from unprotected surfaces of your body 
A wind chill factor is important in causing heat loss 
Risk factors Risk factors for hypothermia include 
The body s ability to regulate temperature and to sense cold may lessen with age 
The body s natural shivering response is diminished in people who ve been drinking alcohol 
Some health disorders affect your body s ability to regulate body temperature 
Some drugs can change the body s ability to regulate its temperature 
Examples include certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, narcotic pain medications and sedatives 
Decay and death of tissue resulting from an interruption in blood flow gangrene 
Avoid activities that would cause you to sweat a lot 
Outer clothing made of tightly woven, water repellent material is best for wind protection 
Wool, silk or polypropylene inner layers hold body heat better than cotton does 
Have children come inside frequently to warm themselves when they re playing outside 
Run the car for minutes each hour to warm it up 
Cold water safetyWater doesn t have to be extremely cold to cause hypothermia 
Any water that s colder than normal body temperature causes heat loss 
If you plan to ride in a watercraft, wear a life jacket 
Keep a whistle attached to your life jacket to signal for help 
Unless a boat, another person or a life jacket is close by, stay put 
Swimming will use up energy and may shorten survival time 
Hold your knees to your chest to protect the trunk of your body 
Check in services to see if you and your home are warm enough during cold weather 
Community warming centers, safe and warm daytime locations where you can go during cold weather 
Overview Cold sores, or fever blisters, are a common viral infection 
They are tiny, fluid filled blisters on and around the lips 
After the blisters break, a scab forms that can last several days 
Cold sores usually heal in to weeks without leaving a scar 
Cold sores spread from person to person by close contact, such as kissing 
The virus can spread even if you don t see the sores 
There s no cure for cold sores, but treatment can help manage outbreaks 
Prescription antiviral medicine or creams can help sores heal more quickly 
And they may make future outbreaks happen less often and be shorter and less serious 
Small fluid filled blisters often form along the border of the lips 
Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth 
This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over 
Symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence 
And the blisters can take to weeks to heal completely 
Children under years old may have cold sores inside their mouths 
Canker sores involve only the mucous membrane and aren t caused by the herpes simplex virus 
When to see a doctorCold sores generally clear up without treatment 
Causes Cold sores are caused by certain strains of the herpes simplex virus HSV 
Shared eating utensils, razors and towels can also spread HSV 
Cold sores are most likely to spread when you have oozing blisters 
But you can spread the virus even if you don t have blisters 
Many people who are infected with the virus that causes cold sores never develop symptoms 
Hormonal changes, such as those related to a menstrual period 
Risk factors Almost everyone is at risk of cold sores 
Most adults carry the virus that causes cold sores, even if they ve never had symptoms 
Both HSV and HSV can be spread to the fingers 
This type of infection is often referred to as herpes whitlow 
Children who suck their thumbs may transfer the infection from their mouths to their thumbs 
Take these steps to help avoid spreading cold sores to other people 
Avoid kissing and skin contact with people while blisters are present 
The virus spreads most easily when the blisters leak fluid 
Overview The common cold is an illness affecting your nose and throat 
Most often, it s harmless, but it might not feel that way 
Often, adults may have two or three colds each year 
Most people recover from a common cold in to days 
Most often, you don t need medical care for a common cold 
If symptoms don t get better or if they get worse, see your health care provider 
Illnesses of the nose and throat caused by germs are called upper respiratory tract infections 
Most often, it doesn t mean that you have a bacterial illness 
Fever greater than degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius that lasts more than three days 
Most children with a common cold don t need to see a health care provider 
Get medical care right away if your child has any of the following 
Fever of degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius in newborns up to weeks 
Rising fever or fever lasting more than two days in a child of any age 
A cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose 
Droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks 
Sharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones 
Touching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus 
Risk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold 
Having a long term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk 
Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter 
Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold 
This is the swelling and build up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum 
A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don t have asthma 
For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse 
These are air filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose 
A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis 
People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions 
You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness 
Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least seconds 
Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands 
These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops 
This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold 
Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands 
Don t share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members 
Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you re in crowds 
Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy 
Colic Overview Colic is frequent, prolonged and intense crying or fussiness in a healthy infant 
These episodes often occur in the evening, when parents themselves are often tired 
The range for what s considered typical crying is difficult to pin down 
Intense crying that may seem more like screaming or an expression of pain 
Gas is likely the result of swallowed air during prolonged crying 
Risk factors Risk factors for colic are not well understood 
Research has not shown differences in risk when the following factors were considered 
Complications Colic does not cause short term or long term medical problems for a child 
Research has shown an association between colic and the following problems with parent well being 
Shaking a baby can cause serious damage to the brain and death 
This segment of the large intestine is called the colon 
It also may be due to reduced blood flow caused by low blood pressure 
The diminished blood flow doesn t provide enough oxygen for the cells in the digestive system 
This can result in tissue damage to the affected area of the intestine 
Ischemic colitis can be misdiagnosed because it can easily be confused with other digestive problems 
You may need medicine to treat ischemic colitis or prevent infection 
Or you may need surgery if your colon has been damaged 
Pain, tenderness or cramping in your belly, which can occur suddenly or happen over time 
They more frequently have to undergo surgery and also have a higher risk of death 
Contact your health care provider if you develop worrisome symptoms, such as bloody diarrhea 
Causes The precise cause of diminished blood flow to the colon isn t always clear 
But several factors can increase your risk of ischemic colitis 
Buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of an artery, also called atherosclerosis 
Low blood pressure, also called hypotension, associated with dehydration, heart failure, surgery, trauma or shock 
Bowel obstruction caused by a hernia, scar tissue or a tumor 
Surgery involving the heart or blood vessels, or the digestive or gynecological systems 
Risk factors Risk factors for ischemic colitis include 
The condition occurs mostly frequently in adults older than age 
Reduced blood flow, due to heart failure, low blood pressure or shock 
It may also be caused by certain conditions, such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis 
Scar tissue that forms after surgery may cause reduced blood flow 
Complications Ischemic colitis usually gets better on its own within to days 
Tissue death, also called gangrene, resulting from diminished blood flow 
Hole formation, also known as perforation, in the intestine or persistent bleeding 
Most people who have ischemic colitis recover quickly and may never have another episode 
Overview Microscopic colitis is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the large intestine 
The tissue appears typical on exam with a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy 
Collagenous colitis, in which a thick layer of protein called collagen grows in colon tissue 
Lymphocytic colitis, in which white blood cells called lymphocytes increase in colon tissue 
Researchers believe collagenous kuh LAYJ uh nus colitis and lymphocytic colitis may be forms of the same condition 
Symptoms, testing and treatment are the same for both subtypes 
Not being able to control bowel movements, called fecal incontinence 
Bile acid not absorbed as it should be that inflames the lining of the colon 
Bacteria that make toxins or viruses that interact with the lining of the colon 
Autoimmune disease linked to microscopic colitis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease or psoriasis 
Autoimmune disease happens when the body s immune system attacks healthy tissues 
Risk factors Risk factors for microscopic colitis include 
Microscopic colitis is most common in people older than age 
Women are more likely to have microscopic colitis than are men 
Some studies suggest a link between post menopausal hormone therapy and microscopic colitis 
Pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others and naproxen sodium Aleve 
Complications There are minimal complications for most people once microscopic colitis is successfully treated 
The condition does not increase the risk of colon cancer 
In most people, symptoms usually develop over time, rather than suddenly 
Ulcerative colitis can be draining and can sometimes lead to life threatening complications 
SymptomsUlcerative colitis symptoms can vary, depending on the severity of inflammation and where it occurs 
Rectal bleeding passing small amount of blood with stool 
Most people with ulcerative colitis have mild to moderate symptoms 
TypesHealth care providers often classify ulcerative colitis according to its location 
Inflammation is confined to the area closest to the anus, also called the rectum 
Rectal bleeding may be the only sign of the disease 
Inflammation involves the rectum and sigmoid colon the lower end of the colon 
Inflammation extends from the rectum up through the sigmoid and descending portions of the colon 
An unexplained fever lasting more than a day or two 
Although ulcerative colitis usually isn t fatal, it s a serious disease 
However, researchers now know that these factors may aggravate but don t cause ulcerative colitis 
However, most people with ulcerative colitis don t have this family history 
Risk factors Ulcerative colitis affects about the same number of women and men 
Some people may not develop the disease until after age 
If you re of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, your risk is even higher 
A hole in the colon, also called a perforated colon 
A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall 
This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse 
Symptoms usually include sudden chest pain and shortness of breath 
On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life threatening event 
SymptomsThe main symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden chest pain and shortness of breath 
Severity of symptoms may depend on how much of the lung is collapsed 
If your chest pain is severe or breathing becomes increasingly difficult, get immediate emergency care 
Any blunt or penetrating injury to your chest can cause lung collapse 
Small air blisters blebs can develop on the top of the lungs 
A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe 
The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest 
Anyone who has had one pneumothorax is at increased risk of another 
But over time, some colon polyps can develop into colon cancer 
Colon cancer can be fatal when found in its later stages 
The best prevention for colon cancer is regular screening for and removal of polyps 
SymptomsMost people with colon polyps do not have any symptoms 
However, several other conditions also can cause changes in bowel habits 
Blood can show up as red streaks in your stool or make stool appear black 
A change in color also may be caused by certain foods, medicines or dietary supplements 
Bleeding from polyps can happen slowly over time, without visible blood in your stool 
A large colon polyp can block part of your bowel, leading to crampy abdominal pain 
When to see a doctorSee your health care provider if you experience 
A change in your bowel habits that lasts longer than a week 
You have risk factors, such as a family history of colon cancer 
Some high risk individuals should begin regular screening much earlier than age 
Causes Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way 
In the colon and rectum, this continued growth of cells can cause polyps to form 
There are two main categories of polyps, nonneoplastic and neoplastic 
Adenomas are the most likely to turn into cancer if given enough time to grow 
Serrated polyps also may become cancerous, depending on their size and location 
In general for neoplastic polyps, the larger the polyp, the greater the risk of cancer 
Risk factors Factors that might cause colon polyps or cancer include 
If many family members have them, your risk is even greater 
Alcohol intake combined with smoking also appears to increase the risk 
Black Americans have a higher risk of developing colon cancer 
Hereditary polyp disordersRarely, people inherit genetic irregularities that cause colon polyps to form 
Screening and early detection can help prevent the growth or spread of these cancers 
People with MAP often develop multiple adenomatous polyps and colon cancer at a young age 
The earlier polyps are removed, the less likely it is that they will become cancerous 
But it isn t clear whether calcium has any protective benefits against colon cancer 
Other studies have shown that vitamin D may protect against colorectal cancer 
If you have a family history of colon polyps, consider having genetic counseling 
Men are more likely to be born with color blindness 
Most people with color blindness can t distinguish between certain shades of red and green 
Less commonly, people with color blindness can t distinguish between shades of blue and yellow 
Certain eye diseases and some medications also can cause color blindness 
SymptomsYou may have a color vision deficiency and not know it 
People affected by color blindness may not be able to distinguish 
Often, a person who is red green or blue yellow deficient isn t completely insensitive to both colors 
It s important that children get comprehensive eye exams, including color vision testing, before starting school 
The cones are sensitive to short blue , medium green or long red wavelengths of light 
Inherited color deficiencies are much more common in males than in females 
The most common color deficiency is red green, with blue yellow deficiency being much less common 
It is rare to have no color vision at all 
You can inherit a mild, moderate or severe degree of the disorder 
Inherited color deficiencies usually affect both eyes, and the severity doesn t change over your lifetime 
Your ability to see colors deteriorates slowly as you age 
Overview Coma is a state of prolonged loss of consciousness 
Quick action is needed to preserve life and brain function 
Depressed brainstem reflexes, such as pupils not responding to light 
When to see a doctorA coma is a medical emergency 
Seek immediate medical care for the person in a coma 
These are often caused by traffic collisions or acts of violence 
Tumors in the brain or brainstem can cause a coma 
Blood sugar levels that become too high or too low can cause a coma 
Severe cases of these infections can result in brain damage or a coma 
Overdosing on drugs or alcohol can result in a coma 
Some people who recover from a coma end up with major or minor disabilities 
Common cold in babies Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Nasal congestion and a runny nose are the main signs of a cold 
Also, they have not yet developed immunity to many common infections 
Within the first year of life, most babies have six to eight colds 
They may have even more if they re in child care centers 
SymptomsThe first signs of the common cold in a baby are often 
Other signs and symptoms of a common cold in a baby may include 
Trouble nursing or taking a bottle due to nasal congestion 
When to see a doctorYour baby s immune system will need time to mature 
But it s important to take your baby s signs and symptoms seriously 
If symptoms don t improve or if they worsen, it s time to talk to your doctor 
If your baby is months old or older, call the doctor if your baby 
Has red eyes or develops yellow or greenish eye discharge 
Coughs hard enough to cause vomiting or changes in skin color 
A cold virus enters your baby s body through his or her mouth, eyes or nose 
Once infected by a virus, your baby generally becomes immune to that virus 
Some viruses live on surfaces for two hours or longer 
Your baby may catch a virus by touching a contaminated surface, such as a toy 
Risk factors A few factors put babies at higher risk of a common cold 
Exposure to anyone with a cold can increase the risk of getting a cold 
Complications These conditions can occur along with a common cold 
This is the most common complication of the common cold 
Ear infections occur when bacteria or viruses enter the space behind the eardrum 
A cold can trigger wheezing, even if your child doesn t have asthma 
If your child does have asthma, a cold can make it worse 
A common cold that doesn t resolve may lead to an infection within the sinuses sinusitis 
A common cold can lead to other infections, including pneumonia, bronchiolitis and croup 
The best defense against the common cold is commonsense precautions and frequent hand washing 
If you have a newborn, don t allow visits from anyone who s sick 
If possible, avoid public transportation and public gatherings with your newborn 
Wash your hands thoroughly and often with soap and water for at least seconds 
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands 
Teach everyone in the household to cough or sneeze into a tissue 
Throw away used tissues right away and then wash your hands thoroughly 
If you can t reach a tissue in time, cough or sneeze into your elbow 
Simple preventive measures can help keep the common cold at bay 
There s also an increased risk of digestive disorders, autoimmune disorders, blood disorders and cancer 
SymptomsHow bad symptoms are varies greatly between people with CVID 
Symptoms of common variable immunodeficiency may appear during childhood or the teen years 
If you have CVID, you ll likely have repeated infections before being diagnosed 
The most common types of infections include pneumonia, sinusitis, ear infections and gastrointestinal infections 
In around of people with CVID, a gene change has been found 
Common warts are caused by a virus and are transmitted by touch 
Common warts are usually harmless and eventually disappear on their own 
But many people choose to remove them because they find them bothersome or embarrassing 
SymptomsCommon warts usually occur on your fingers or hands and may be 
Sprinkled with black pinpoints, which are small, clotted blood vessels 
When to see a doctorSee your doctor for common warts if 
The growths are painful or change in appearance or color 
You ve tried treating the warts, but they persist, spread or recur 
Causes Common warts are caused by the human papillomavirus HPV 
Risk factors People at higher risk of developing common warts include 
People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV AIDS or people 
Warts occur more often in skin that has been broken 
Nibbling the skin around your fingernails opens the door for the virus 
And avoid brushing, clipping or shaving areas that have warts 
Complex regional pain syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The pain is out of proportion to the severity of the initial injury 
Continuous burning or throbbing pain, usually in the arm, leg, hand or foot 
Changes in skin temperature alternating between sweaty and cold 
Changes in skin color, ranging from white and blotchy to red or blue 
Changes in skin texture, which may become tender, thin or shiny in the affected area 
Symptoms may change over time and vary from person to person 
Over time, the affected limb can become cold and pale 
It may undergo skin and nail changes as well as muscle spasms and tightening 
In some people, signs and symptoms of CRPS go away on their own 
In others, signs and symptoms may persist for months to years 
CRPS typically occurs as a result of a trauma or an injury 
CRPS occurs in two types, with similar signs and symptoms, but different causes 
Once referred to as causalgia, this type has symptoms similar to those of type 
But type CRPS occurs after a distinct nerve injury 
Many cases of CRPS occur after a forceful trauma to an arm or a leg 
Not everyone who has such an injury will go on to develop CRPS 
PreventionThese steps might help you reduce the risk of developing CRPS 
Gradually these feelings ease, and it s possible to accept loss and move forward 
For some people, feelings of loss are debilitating and don t improve even after time passes 
This is known as complicated grief, sometimes called persistent complex bereavement disorder 
The order and timing of these phases may vary from person to person 
Adjusting to a new reality in which the deceased is no longer present 
Intense sorrow, pain and rumination over the loss of your loved one 
Extreme focus on reminders of the loved one or excessive avoidance of reminders 
Inability to enjoy life or think back on positive experiences with your loved one 
Complicated grief also may be indicated if you continue to 
Believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death 
If you have thoughts of suicideAt times, people with complicated grief may consider suicide 
If you re thinking about suicide, talk to someone you trust 
Risk factors Complicated grief occurs more often in females and with older age 
Factors that may increase the risk of developing complicated grief include 
Social isolation or loss of a support system or friendships 
Past history of depression, separation anxiety or post traumatic stress disorder PTSD 
Complications Complicated grief can affect you physically, mentally and socially 
Increased risk of physical illness, such as heart disease, cancer or high blood pressure 
You may experience distress at the thought of getting rid of the items 
You gradually keep or gather a huge number of items, regardless of their actual value 
Countertops, sinks, stoves, desks, stairways and all other surfaces are usually piled with stuff 
You may not be able to use some areas for their intended purpose 
For example, you may not be able to cook in the kitchen 
SymptomsThe first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years 
Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior 
You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home 
Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others 
Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value 
Building up clutter to the point where you can t use rooms 
Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in 
Disorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items 
Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas 
Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home 
Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home 
Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter 
Also, they don t cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder 
Hoarding animalsPeople who hoard animals may collect dozens or even hundreds of pets 
Because of the large numbers, these animals often aren t cared for properly 
Check with the local or county government for resources in your area 
Genetics, brain function and stressful life events are being studied as possible causes 
Risk factors Hoarding usually starts around ages to 
Hoarding is more common in older adults than in younger adults 
Complications Hoarding disorder can cause a variety of complications, including 
Conditions that aren t clean and can be a health risk 
Other mental health disordersHoarding disorder also is linked with other mental health conditions, such as 
Overview Compulsive sexual behavior is sometimes called hypersexuality or sexual addiction 
It s an intense focus on sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors that can t be controlled 
Compulsive sexual behavior may involve different kinds of commonly enjoyable sexual experiences 
But with treatment and self help, you can learn to manage compulsive sexual behavior 
SymptomsSome signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include 
You ve tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior 
You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems 
You have trouble making and keeping healthy and stable relationships 
As you decide whether to seek professional help, ask yourself 
Set aside any shame or embarrassment and focus on the benefits of getting treatment 
Remember that you re not alone many people struggle with compulsive sexual behavior 
Mental health professionals are trained to be understanding and not judge people 
But not all mental health providers are experienced in treating this condition 
Look for a provider who has experience in diagnosing and treating compulsive sexual behavior 
Ask for help right awayAsk a health care provider for help right away if 
You think you may hurt yourself or others because of uncontrolled sexual behavior 
You feel like your sexual behavior is slipping out of control 
Although the exact causes of compulsive sexual behavior are not clear, possible causes may include 
Compulsive sexual behavior, over time, might cause changes in the brain s pathways, called neural circuits 
This may happen especially in areas of the brain that are related to reinforcement 
Over time, more intense sexual content and stimulation are usually needed to get satisfaction or relief 
When these are out of balance, your sexual desire and behavior could be affected 
Also, treatment of Parkinson s disease with certain medicines may cause compulsive sexual behavior 
Factors that may increase the risk of compulsive sexual behavior include 
Also, the risk of compulsive sexual behavior may be higher in people who have 
Another mental health condition, such as depression, anxiety or a gambling addiction 
Family conflicts or family members with problems such as addiction 
Complications Compulsive sexual behavior can cause many problems that affect both you and others 
Develop other mental health conditions, such as depression, severe distress and anxiety 
Neglect or lie to your partner and family, harming or destroying important relationships 
Have financial problems from buying pornography, internet or telephone sex, and sexual services 
But a few things may help you keep control of problem behavior 
Getting help also may prevent shame, relationship problems and harmful acts from getting worse 
Depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions can make compulsive sexual behavior worse 
Often the items stolen have little value and you could afford to buy them 
Inability to resist powerful urges to steal items that you don t need 
Feeling increased tension, anxiety or arousal leading up to the theft 
Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft 
Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle 
They steal simply because the urge is so powerful that they can t resist it 
Episodes of kleptomania generally happen suddenly, without planning and without help from another person 
Most people with kleptomania steal from public places, such as stores 
Some may steal from friends or acquaintances, such as at a party 
The stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used 
When to see a doctorIf you can t stop shoplifting or stealing, seek medical advice 
However, a mental health provider usually doesn t report your thefts to authorities 
Some people seek medical help because they re afraid they ll get caught and have legal problems 
Or they ve already been arrested, and they re legally required to seek treatment 
You re concerned because you care about the person s health and well being 
If you need help preparing for this conversation, talk with your health care provider 
Low levels of serotonin are common in people prone to impulsive behaviors 
Stealing may cause the release of dopamine another neurotransmitter 
Dopamine causes pleasurable feelings, and some people seek this rewarding feeling again and again 
An imbalance in this system could make it harder to resist urges 
This creates a strong habit that becomes hard to break 
Complications Left untreated, kleptomania can result in severe emotional, family, work, legal and financial problems 
For example, you know stealing is wrong but you feel powerless to resist the impulse 
As a result, you may be filled with guilt, shame, self loathing and humiliation 
Overview A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that affects brain function 
Not everyone who experiences a blow to the body or head has a concussion 
Some concussions cause the person to lose consciousness, but most do not 
SymptomsThe symptoms of a concussion can be subtle and may not occur right away 
The amnesia usually involves forgetting the event that caused the concussion 
A witness may observe these symptoms in the person with a concussion 
Forgetfulness, such as asking the same question over and over 
But sometimes symptoms may not occur for days after the injury, such as 
When to see a doctorSee a healthcare professional within to days if 
You or your child experiences a head injury, even if emergency care isn t required 
For example, the person may not recognize people or places 
Dizziness that doesn t go away or that goes away and comes back 
Large head bumps or bruises, such as bruises around the eyes or behind the ears 
When symptoms occur in athletesNever return to play or vigorous activity immediately following a concussion 
Gradual return to learning and physical activity is individual and depends on the symptoms 
It also may be caused by the sudden acceleration or deceleration of the head 
Risk factors Events and factors that may increase the risk of a concussion include 
Activities that can lead to falls, especially in young children and older adults 
High risk sports such as American football, hockey, soccer, rugby, boxing or other contact sports 
Not using proper safety equipment and supervision when playing high risk sports 
Having had a previous concussion also increases the risk of having another 
Some people experience concussion related headaches for several days to weeks after a brain injury 
A small number of people may have multiple symptoms that last longer than expected 
Longer lasting symptoms may include headaches, dizziness and trouble with thinking 
If these symptoms persist beyond three months, they re called persistent post concussive symptoms 
At this time, there s no conclusive evidence that these repeated brain injuries affect brain function 
It s important that athletes never return to sports while they re still experiencing symptoms of concussion 
PreventionThese tips may help you prevent or minimize the risk of a concussion 
Make sure the equipment fits properly, is well maintained and is worn correctly 
Follow the rules of the game and practice good sportsmanship 
Wearing a seat belt may prevent serious injury, including head injury, during a traffic accident 
Keep your floors free of anything that might cause you to trip and fall 
Falls around the home are a leading cause of head injury 
Educate coaches, athletes, parents and others about concussions to help spread awareness 
Overview Genital warts are one of the most common types of sexually transmitted infections 
The virus that causes the warts is called human papillomavirus HPV 
Genital warts affect the moist tissues of the genital area 
Often, the warts are too small to be seen with your eyes 
Vaccines can help protect against certain strains of genital HPV 
Area between the outer part of the genitals and the anus 
Small swellings in the genital area that may be skin colored or a different color 
A cauliflower like shape caused by a few warts close together 
Genital warts can be so small and flat that you can t see them 
But rarely, they can multiply into large clusters in someone with a weakened immune system 
There are more than strains of HPV that affect the genital area 
Having sex without a condom or with more than one partner 
Having sex with a partner whose sexual history you don t know 
Having a weakened immune system, such as from HIV or medicines from an organ transplant 
Complications An HPV infection can lead to health problems such as 
Cervical cancer has been closely linked with genital HPV infection 
Pap tests are key for those who ve been infected with higher risk types of HPV 
Warts on the vaginal wall can hinder the stretching of vaginal tissues during childbirth 
Large warts on the vulva or in the vagina can bleed when stretched during delivery 
The baby might need surgery to keep the airway from being blocked 
And if you have sex, limit your number of partners 
It s safest to have sex with just one partner who only has sex with you 
It s also a good idea to use a condom every time you have sex 
That s because HPV can infect parts of the body that the condom doesn t cover 
But the vaccine can be given as early as age 
It s ideal for children to receive the vaccine before they have sexual contact 
They include soreness where the shot was given, headaches, a low grade fever or flu like symptoms 
Research has shown that two doses work for children under 
The third dose should be given months after the first 
Other HPV vaccines are offered outside of the United States 
Cortisol, which regulates the body s response to illness or stress 
Mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, which regulate sodium and potassium levels 
This rarer, more severe form is usually detected at birth or in early infancy 
It may not be identified until childhood or early adulthood 
Classic CAH causes the body to produce an insufficient amount of cortisol 
This is known as an adrenal crisis, and it can be life threatening 
Pubic hair and other signs of puberty may appear at a very early age 
Rapid growth may occur during childhood with an advanced bone age 
Nonclassic CAHOften there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born 
Females who have nonclassic CAH may have typical appearing genitals at birth 
Irregular menstrual periods, or not having any at all, and problems getting pregnant 
Masculine characteristics such as facial hair, excessive body hair and a deepening voice 
In both females and males, signs of nonclassic CAH may also include 
Early appearance of pubic hair and other signs of early puberty 
Rapid growth during childhood with an advanced bone age and shorter than expected final height 
In children who have nonclassic CAH, signs and symptoms of early puberty may appear 
This enzyme is required by the body to make proper amounts of hormones 
There are other much rarer enzyme deficiencies that also cause CAH 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of having CAH include 
Being of Ashkenazi Jewish, Latino, Mediterranean, Yugoslav or Yup ik ancestry 
Complications People who have classic CAH are at risk of adrenal crisis 
This is a life threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment 
Adrenal crisis can occur within the first few days after birth 
People who have either classic or nonclassic CAH may experience fertility problems 
Some congenital heart defects in children are simple and don t need treatment 
Swelling in the legs, belly or areas around the eyes 
Shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain 
Less serious congenital heart defects may not be diagnosed until later in childhood 
Signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects in older children may include 
Altered connections allow blood to flow where it usually wouldn t 
An altered connection can cause oxygen poor blood to mix with oxygen rich blood 
This lowers the amount of oxygen sent through the body 
The change in blood flow forces the heart and lungs to work harder 
Types of altered connections in the heart or blood vessels include 
Atrial septal defect is a hole between the upper heart chambers atria 
But in some babies, it stays open, causing incorrect blood flow between the two arteries 
Heart valves are like doorways between the heart chambers and the blood vessels 
Heart valves open and close to keep blood moving in the proper direction 
If the heart valves can t open and close correctly, blood can t flow smoothly 
This creates a small, narrowed opening for blood to pass through 
The heart must work harder to pump blood through the valve 
Eventually, this leads to enlarging of the heart and thickening of the heart muscle 
Very complex heart problems may cause significant changes in blood flow or undeveloped heart chambers 
A hole in the wall between the heart s lower chambers ventricles 
A narrowed passage between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery 
A shift in the connection of the aorta to the heart 
Blood can t travel its usual route to get oxygen from the lungs 
This congenital heart defect restricts blood flow and causes the right ventricle to be underdeveloped 
Complete transposition of the great arteries is typically noticed during pregnancy or soon after birth 
A major part of the heart fails to develop properly 
Having rubella during pregnancy can cause problems in a baby s heart development 
A blood test done before pregnancy can determine if you re immune to rubella 
Certain medications taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects, including congenital heart defects 
Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects 
Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of a congenital heart defect in the baby 
Many children with an extra st chromosome Down syndrome have congenital heart defects 
A missing piece deletion of genetic material on chromosome also causes heart defects 
This serious complication may develop in babies who have a significant heart defect 
They may be smaller than other children of the same age 
Talk to your child s provider if you re concerned about your child s mental health 
It may help reduce the risk of heart defects as well 
A rubella infection during pregnancy may affect a baby s heart development 
During pregnancy, have someone else do any painting and cleaning with strong smelling products 
Tell your provider about all the medications you take, including those bought without a prescription 
Treatment may include regular checkups watchful waiting , medications or surgery 
SymptomsFor some people, signs or symptoms of congenital heart disease aren t noticed until adulthood 
Symptoms may return years after a congenital heart defect is treated 
Causes Researchers aren t sure what causes most types of congenital heart disease 
Some congenital heart diseases are passed down through families inherited 
To understand congenital heart disease, it helps to know how the heart typically works 
For instance, children with Down syndrome often have congenital heart defects 
Taking certain medications while pregnant can cause congenital heart disease and other birth defects 
Complications Congenital heart disease can contribute to other health concerns later in life 
Complications may occur years after a congenital heart defect is treated 
Faulty heart signaling causes the heart to beat too fast, too slowly or irregularly 
In some people, severe arrhythmias may cause stroke or sudden cardiac death if not treated 
Scar tissue in the heart from previous surgeries can contribute to this complication 
Untreated, this infection can damage or destroy the heart valves or cause a stroke 
Healthy gums and teeth reduce the risk that bacteria will enter the bloodstream 
Some congenital heart defects send more blood to the lungs, causing pressure to build 
This eventually causes the heart muscle to weaken and sometimes to fail 
PreventionSome types of congenital heart disease occur in families inherited 
In mild cases, the condition might not be detected until later in childhood 
Surgery to bypass or remove the diseased part of the colon is the treatment 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of Hirschsprung s disease vary with the severity of the condition 
Delayed passage of meconium a newborn s first bowel movement 
Hirschsprung s disease occurs when nerve cells in the colon don t form completely 
Nerves in the colon control the muscle contractions that move food through the bowels 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of Hirschsprung s disease include 
Complications Children who have Hirschsprung s disease are prone to a serious intestinal infection called enterocolitis 
Heart tissue or heart muscle problems near the mitral valve 
More than one opening in the area of the mitral valve 
Types of heart valve disease caused by mitral valve anomalies include 
Narrowing of the mitral valve, also called mitral valve stenosis 
The valve flaps are stiff and the valve opening may be narrowed 
This condition reduces blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle 
Sometimes they push backward into the left upper heart chamber as the heart squeezes 
You can have both mitral valve stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation 
People with mitral valve anomalies also often have other heart problems present at birth 
A heart murmur is a symptom of mitral valve disease 
An echocardiogram is the main test used to diagnose congenital mitral valve anomalies 
In an echocardiogram, sound waves create video images of the beating heart 
Sound waves from the device go through the chest to the heart 
The device records the sound wave echoes from the heart 
Your provider may recommend another test called a transesophageal echocardiogram 
TreatmentTreatment depends on the symptoms and how severe the condition is 
If you have congenital mitral valve anomalies, you should have regular health checkups 
Some people may eventually need surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve 
Mitral valve repairMitral valve repair is done when possible, as it saves the heart valve 
Surgeons may do one or more of the following during mitral valve repair 
Separate, shorten, lengthen or replace the cords that support the valve 
Remove excess valve tissue so that the leaflets can close tightly 
Tighten or reinforce the ring around a valve annulus using an artificial ring 
In mitral valve replacement, a surgeon removes the damaged valve 
The tissue valve is also called a biological tissue valve 
Follow up carePeople born with congenital mitral valve anomalies need lifelong health checkups 
It s best to be cared for by a provider trained in congenital heart conditions 
These types of providers are called pediatric and adult congenital cardiologists 
There are many types of congenital myasthenic syndromes, depending on which gene is affected 
Congenital myasthenic syndromes are usually identified at birth or early childhood and are lifelong conditions 
Medications are generally an effective treatment for muscle weakness symptoms 
Rarely, some children may have a mild form that doesn t need treatment 
Common to all congenital myasthenic syndromes is muscle weakness that worsens with physical activity 
Droopy eyelids and poor eye control, often with double vision 
Delayed development of wrist, hand and finger skills, such as brushing teeth or combing hair 
Depending on the type of congenital myasthenic syndrome, other signs and symptoms can include 
Unusual facial features, such as narrow jaw or wide set eyes 
Disrupted signals that cause loss of muscle function can occur in different locations 
Muscle cells where the impulse is received postsynaptic , the most common location 
Some types of congenital myasthenic syndromes are the result of congenital disorders of glycosylation 
Glycosylation is a complex chemical process that plays a role in regulating communication between cells 
Glycosylation defects can adversely affect the transmission of signals from nerve cells to muscles 
Congenital myasthenic syndromes are most commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern 
The affected child inherits two copies of the abnormal gene one from each parent 
In some cases, the affected gene occurs randomly and is not inherited 
The anterior fontanel is the soft spot felt just behind a baby s forehead 
In rare cases, craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes syndromic craniosynostosis 
Early diagnosis and treatment allow your baby s brain adequate space to grow and develop 
A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected 
Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures 
Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndromes and is called syndromic craniosynostosis 
The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected 
Other reasons for a misshapen headA misshapen head doesn t always indicate craniosynostosis 
Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby s head growth or shape 
These syndromes usually also include other physical features and health problems 
These conditions include narrowed arteries in the heart and high blood pressure 
Try to lose weight, exercise, use less salt and manage stress 
Some may need a heart transplant or a device to help the heart pump blood 
Chest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack 
Call or emergency medical help if you have any of the following 
Rapid or irregular heartbeat with shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting 
Sudden, severe shortness of breath and coughing up white or pink, foamy mucus 
Call your health care provider right away if you have heart failure and 
You gain pounds kilograms or more within a few days 
Causes Heart failure can be caused by a weakened, damaged or stiff heart 
If the heart is damaged or weakened, the heart chambers may stretch and get bigger 
The heart can t pump out the needed amount of blood 
Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure 
The disease results from the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries 
This reduces blood flow and can lead to heart attack 
A heart attack occurs suddenly when an artery feeding the heart becomes completely blocked 
The valves of the heart keep blood flowing the right way 
If a valve isn t working properly, the heart must work harder to pump blood 
Treating some types of heart valve problems may reverse heart failure 
A heart problem that you re born with, also called a congenital heart defect 
Treating an irregular heart rhythm may reverse heart failure in some people 
Heart failure usually begins with the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle 
The lower right heart chamber is called the right ventricle 
This type affects the lower right heart chamber, called the right ventricle 
Fluid may back up into the belly, legs and feet, causing swelling 
This type affects the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle 
Fluid may back up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath 
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction HFrEF , also called systolic heart failure 
The left ventricle can t squeeze as strong as it should 
The heart isn t strong enough to pump enough blood to the body 
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction HFpEF , also called diastolic heart failure 
Risk factors Diseases and conditions that increase the risk of heart failure include 
Narrowed arteries may limit the heart s supply of oxygen rich blood, resulting in weakened heart muscle 
A heart attack is a form of coronary artery disease that occurs suddenly 
Having a heart valve that doesn t work properly raises the risk of heart failure 
The heart works harder than it has to when blood pressure is high 
Having diabetes increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease 
People who have obesity have a higher risk of developing heart failure 
Medicines that may increase the risk of heart failure include 
Don t stop taking these medicines without first talking to your health care provider 
The heart s ability to work decreases with age, even in healthy people 
Drinking too much alcohol may weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure 
Using tobacco increases the risk of heart disease and heart failure 
Your health care provider can examine you and run tests to check for complications 
Heart failure can reduce the blood flow to the kidneys 
Kidney damage from heart failure can require dialysis for treatment 
Heart failure can cause changes in the heart s size and function 
These changes may damage heart valves and cause irregular heartbeats 
Heart failure can cause fluid buildup that puts too much pressure on the liver 
These conditions include coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity 
Overview Conjoined twins are two babies who are born physically connected to each other 
Conjoined twins develop when an early embryo only partially separates to form two individuals 
Conjoined twins may also share one or more internal body organs 
It also depends on the experience and skill of the surgical team 
SymptomsThere are no specific symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy 
And there may be more tiredness, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy 
Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using an ultrasound 
How twins are joinedConjoined twins are usually classified according to where they re joined 
The twins sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies 
Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites 
Thoracopagus thor uh KOP uh gus twins are joined face to face at the chest 
They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine 
This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins 
The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs 
But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue 
Cephalopagus sef uh LOP uh gus twins are joined at the head and upper body 
An alternative theory suggests that two separate embryos may somehow fuse together in early development 
What might cause either chain of events to occur is unknown 
Complications Pregnancy with conjoined twins is complex and greatly increases the risk of serious complications 
Severe health issues for twins can occur immediately, such as trouble breathing or heart problems 
Later in life, health issues such as scoliosis, cerebral palsy or learning disabilities may occur 
When small blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen and irritated, they re more visible 
This is what causes the whites of the eyes to appear reddish or pink 
Pink eye is most often caused by a viral infection 
Though pink eye can be irritating, it rarely affects your vision 
When to see a doctorThere are serious eye conditions that can cause eye redness 
Wearing contact lenses that aren t cleaned properly or aren t your own can cause bacterial conjunctivitis 
In response to allergens, your body produces an antibody called immunoglobulin E IgE 
Most allergic conjunctivitis can be controlled with allergy eye drops 
A chemical splash into the eye can cause permanent eye damage 
Ongoing symptoms could indicate that you still have the foreign body in your eye 
Risk factors Risk factors for pink eye include 
Exposure to someone infected with the viral or bacterial form of conjunctivitis 
Prompt evaluation and treatment by your health care provider can reduce the risk of complications 
PreventionPreventing the spread of pink eyePractice good hygiene to control the spread of pink eye 
Keep in mind that pink eye is no more contagious than the common cold 
That s why shortly after birth, an antibiotic ointment is applied to every newborn s eyes 
A lack of dietary fiber, fluids and exercise can cause constipation 
But other medical conditions or certain medicines may be the cause 
Constipation is usually treated with changes in diet and exercise or with nonprescription medicines 
Chronic constipation is having two or more of these symptoms for three months or longer 
Other unusual changes in the shape or color of stools 
Causes Patterns of bowel movements vary from one person to another 
The typical range is three times a day to three times a week 
So it s important to know what is typical for you 
If the stool moves slowly, the body absorbs too much water from the stool 
The stool can become hard, dry and difficult to pass 
Lifestyle causesSlow stool movement may happen when a person does not 
Use the toilet when there s an urge to pass stool 
MedicinesConstipation may be a side effect of some medicines, particularly opioid pain relievers 
Other medicines that may cause constipation include some that treat the following conditions 
Problems with weakness or coordination of these muscles can cause chronic constipation 
Also, tumors in the colon, rectum or nearby tissues can cause a blockage 
Chronic constipation may be linked to any number of things, including 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of chronic constipation include 
Having a mental health condition such as depression or an eating disorder 
Hard stools backed up into the colon, also called fecal impaction 
Eat lots of high fiber foods, including vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grain foods 
Eat fewer foods with low amounts of fiber such as processed foods, dairy and meats 
Create a regular schedule for passing stool, especially after a meal 
Constipation in children Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Constipation in children Overview Constipation in children is a common problem 
A constipated child has infrequent bowel movements or hard, dry stools 
Common causes include early toilet training and changes in diet 
Bowel movements that are hard, dry and difficult to pass 
When to see a doctorConstipation in children usually isn t serious 
However, chronic constipation may lead to complications or signal an underlying condition 
Part of the intestine coming out of the anus rectal prolapse 
Some children withhold when they re away from home because they re uncomfortable using public toilets 
Painful bowel movements caused by large, hard stools also may lead to withholding 
If you begin toilet training too soon, your child may rebel and hold in stool 
Not enough fiber rich fruits and vegetables or fluid in your child s diet may cause constipation 
Certain antidepressants and various other drugs can contribute to constipation 
Children who have family members who have experienced constipation are more likely to develop constipation 
This may be due to shared genetic or environmental factors 
Risk factors Constipation in children is more likely to affect kids who 
Complications Although constipation in children can be uncomfortable, it usually isn t serious 
Painful breaks in the skin around the anus anal fissures 
Rectal prolapse, when the rectum comes out of the anus 
A diet rich in fiber can help your child s body form soft, bulky stool 
For adolescent girls and young women, it s grams a day 
And for adolescent boys and young men, it s grams a day 
Regularly set aside time after meals for your child to use the toilet 
If such delays occur often, they can contribute to constipation 
Give children small rewards for trying to move their bowels 
And don t punish a child who has soiled his or her underwear 
The rash isn t contagious, but it can be very uncomfortable 
Many substances can cause this reaction, such as cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry and plants 
You can try soothing your skin with a cool, wet cloth and other self care steps 
For example, the rash may show up along a leg that brushed against poison ivy 
Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis vary widely and may include 
Leathery patches that are darker than usual hyperpigmented , typically on brown or Black skin 
The rash is so itchy that you can t sleep or go about your day 
Your eyes or nasal passages hurt after inhaling smoke from burning poison ivy 
You think an ingested substance has damaged the lining of your mouth or digestive tract 
The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants 
Often people have irritant and allergic reactions at the same time 
This nonallergic skin reaction occurs when an irritant damages your skin s outer protective layer 
Some people react to strong irritants after a single exposure 
And some people develop a tolerance to the substance over time 
It often affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen 
People often become sensitized to allergens after many contacts with it over years 
Nickel, which is used in jewelry, buckles and many other items 
Personal care products, such as body washes, hair dyes and cosmetics 
Plants such as poison ivy and mango, which contain a highly allergenic substance called urushiol 
Scuba divers or swimmers, due to the rubber in face masks or goggles 
PreventionYou can take the following steps to help prevent contact dermatitis 
Try to identify and avoid the cause of your rash 
Apply an iron on patch to cover metal fasteners next to your skin 
This can help you avoid a reaction to jean snaps, for example 
These products can provide a protective layer for your skin 
Bathe your pet if you think it got into poison ivy or something similar 
Functional neurologic disorder conversion disorder Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
However, the symptoms are real and cause significant distress or problems functioning 
Symptoms can vary in severity and may come and go or be persistent 
Symptoms can affect body movement and function and the senses 
Signs and symptoms that affect body movement and function may include 
Seizures or episodes of shaking and apparent loss of consciousness nonepileptic seizures 
Speech problems, such as the inability to speak or slurred speech 
Causes The exact cause of functional neurologic disorder is unknown 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of functional neurologic disorder include 
Having a neurological disease or disorder, such as epilepsy, migraines or a movement disorder 
Having a family member with a neurological condition or symptoms 
Having a history of physical or sexual abuse or neglect in childhood 
Females may be more likely than males to develop functional neurologic disorder 
A complete blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack 
Symptoms may go unnoticed until a significant blockage causes problems or a heart attack occurs 
Following a heart healthy lifestyle can help prevent coronary artery disease 
Coronary artery disease may also be called coronary heart disease 
Some people say it feels like someone is standing on their chest 
The chest pain usually occurs on the middle or left side of the chest 
The pain usually goes away within minutes after the triggering event ends 
A completely blocked coronary artery will cause a heart attack 
Women may have less typical symptoms, such as neck or jaw pain, nausea and fatigue 
Some heart attacks don t cause any noticeable signs or symptoms 
If you re at high risk of coronary artery disease, talk to your health care provider 
You may need tests to check for narrowed arteries and coronary artery disease 
Besides high cholesterol, damage to the coronary arteries may be caused by 
Getting older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries 
Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease 
A family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease 
People who smoke have a significantly increased risk of heart disease 
Uncontrolled high blood pressure can make arteries hard and stiff arterial stiffness 
Too much bad cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of atherosclerosis 
Not enough good cholesterol called high density lipoprotein HDL also leads to atherosclerosis 
Obesity can lead to type diabetes and high blood pressure 
Ask your health care provider what a healthy weight is for you 
Having long term kidney disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease 
Emotional stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease 
It can also worsen other risk factors of coronary artery disease 
Sometimes coronary artery disease develops without any classic risk factors 
Other possible risk factors for coronary artery disease may include 
This condition causes breathing to stop and start during sleep 
This protein appears in higher than usual amounts when there s inflammation somewhere in the body 
High hs CRP levels may be a risk factor for heart disease 
This is a type of fat lipid in the blood 
High levels may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially for women 
But high levels of homocysteine may increase the risk of coronary artery disease 
This pregnancy complication causes high blood pressure and increased protein in the urine 
It can lead to a higher risk of heart disease later in life 
This can cause chest pain angina or shortness of breath 
The amount of damage depends in part on how quickly you are treated 
Heart failure is when the heart doesn t pump blood as it should 
Not enough blood to the heart can alter normal heart signaling, causing irregular heartbeats 
A healthy lifestyle can help keep the arteries strong and clear of plaque 
Eat a low fat, low salt diet that s rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
Small vessel disease Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Small vessel disease is treatable but may be difficult to detect 
Chest pain, squeezing or discomfort angina , which may get worse with activity or emotional stress 
Discomfort in the left arm, jaw, neck, back or abdomen along with chest pain 
See your health care provider to determine the cause of your symptoms 
Causes In coronary small vessel disease, the small arteries don t relax dilate as usual 
As a result, the heart doesn t get enough oxygen rich blood 
Risk factors Small vessel disease is more common in women than in men 
Increasing age older than in men and older than in women 
A possible complication of small vessel disease is a heart attack 
PreventionThings you can do that might reduce your risk of small vessel disease include 
Talk to your health care provider if you have trouble quitting 
Choose a diet rich in whole grains, lean meat, low fat dairy, and fruits and vegetables 
Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function and keeps blood flowing through the arteries 
Aim for at least minutes a week of moderate activity such as walking 
Ask your health care provider how often you should have your cholesterol numbers checked 
Ask your health care provider how frequently you should have your blood pressure measured 
Overview COVID , also called coronavirus disease , is an illness caused by a virus 
The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus , or more commonly, SARS CoV 
It started spreading at the end of and became a pandemic disease in 
Many people with COVID have no symptoms or mild illness 
Most people recover without long term effects, but some people have symptoms that continue for months 
SymptomsTypical COVID symptoms often show up to days after contact with the virus 
Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting or loose stools, called diarrhea 
Cold like symptoms such as congestion, runny nose or sore throat 
People who have no symptoms but test positive for COVID are called asymptomatic 
For example, many children who test positive don t have symptoms of COVID illness 
People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic 
But COVID can cause serious medical complications and lead to death 
COVID may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness 
When to see a doctorContact a healthcare professional if you test positive for COVID 
Or your healthcare team may plan regular checks to monitor your health 
Get emergency help right away for any of these symptoms 
Skin, lips or nail beds that are pale, gray or blue 
Over time, the body s defense against the COVID virus can fade 
As a virus infects a group of people, the virus copies itself 
During this process, the genetic code can randomly change in each copy 
Cats, dogs, hamsters and ferrets have caught this coronavirus and had symptoms 
It s rare for a person to get COVID from a pet 
Risk factors The main risk factors for COVID are 
If you spend more than minutes in close contact with someone who has COVID 
Many factors affect your risk of catching the virus that causes COVID 
Some people are at a higher risk of serious COVID illness than others 
This includes people age and older as well as babies younger than months 
Those age groups have the highest risk of needing hospital care for COVID 
Not every risk factor for serious COVID illness is known 
Known risk factors for serious illness include people who have not gotten a COVID vaccine 
Serious illness also is a higher risk for people who have 
Other medical conditions that may raise the risk of serious illness from COVID include 
Weakened immune system from solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants, some medicines, or HIV 
Factors linked to a health issue may raise the risk of serious COVID illness too 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the body s organs do not get enough oxygen 
This syndrome has often been called long COVID, or post COVID 
You might hear it called long haul COVID , post COVID conditions or PASC 
Other infections, such as the flu and polio, can lead to long term illness 
So, research into the specific effects of long term COVID symptoms continues 
Researchers do think that post COVID syndrome can happen after an illness of any severity 
The COVID vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused by COVID 
This vaccine is available for people age months and older 
People age and older are up to date after one Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine 
People age and older are up to date with one Moderna COVID vaccine 
This vaccine is available for people age years and older 
They usually don t need to get the same vaccine each time 
Some people should get all their vaccine doses from the same vaccine maker, including 
People age years and older with weakened immune systems 
The vaccine you or your child got earlier isn t available 
You don t know which vaccine you or your child received 
Know what to do if you get sick so you can quickly start treatment 
Avoid sharing household items such as dishes or towels if you re sick 
If you have symptoms of COVID test for the infection 
Or test five days after you came in contact with the virus 
Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms, if possible 
Or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer with at least alcohol 
For example, clean doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters regularly 
Try to spread out in crowded public areas, especially in places with poor airflow 
This is important if you have a higher risk of serious illness 
Travel and COVID Travel brings people together from areas where illnesses may be at higher levels 
Masks can help slow the spread of respiratory diseases in general, including COVID 
Symptoms also may include poor coordination, stiffness, trouble thinking, and trouble with speech or language 
Trouble moving on one or both sides of the body, which gets worse over time 
Postures of the hands or feet that can t be controlled 
Eventually, people with the disease lose the ability to walk 
The buildup of tau may lead to the breakdown of the cells 
Half of the people who have symptoms have corticobasal degeneration 
But the second most common cause of corticobasal degeneration symptoms is Alzheimer s disease 
Other causes of corticobasal degeneration include progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick s disease or Creutzfeldt Jakob disease 
Risk factors There are no known risk factors for corticobasal degeneration corticobasal syndrome 
Complications People with corticobasal degeneration corticobasal syndrome may develop serious complications 
There are two types primary cough headaches and secondary cough headaches 
Secondary cough headaches can be more serious and may require treatment with surgery 
The provider can determine whether a cough or something else caused the pain 
Begin suddenly with and just after coughing or other types of straining 
May be followed by a dull, aching pain for hours 
Secondary cough headaches often present with only a cough headache, but you may also experience 
For example, people with migraine might find that their headaches get worse when they cough 
Causes Primary cough headachesThe cause of primary cough headaches is unknown 
A defect in the part of the brain that controls balance cerebellum 
Some of these types of defects are called Chiari malformations 
A weakness in one of the blood vessels in the brain cerebral aneurysm 
This may help reduce the number of headaches you experience 
Treating conditions that would cause coughing, such as bronchitis or other lung infections 
Experts are still studying the cause of MIS C and risk factors for getting it 
Most children who catch the COVID virus have only a mild illness 
It most often happens within months after having COVID 
Most children who have MIS C eventually get better with medical care 
People with a prior infection may not have had serious symptoms 
But if no other diagnosis fits, health care professionals may diagnose MIS C if a child 
Emergency warning signs of MIS CGet help right away if your child has 
Causes The exact cause of MIS C is not known yet 
Many children with MIS C have had a recent infection with the COVID virus 
But cases are reported among children ages to 
A few cases have also happened in older kids and in babies 
Complications MIS C is thought to be a complication of COVID 
In rare cases, MIS C could lead to permanent damage or even death 
PreventionIn the U S , COVID vaccines are now offered to people age months and older 
A vaccine can prevent you or your child from getting or spreading the COVID virus 
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least seconds 
In public indoor spaces, keep distance between yourself and others 
When COVID community levels are high, wear a face mask in public indoor places 
Urge your child to follow your lead and avoid touching the face 
Cover your mouth with a tissue or your elbow when you sneeze or cough 
This includes areas of your home such as doorknobs, light switches, remotes and keyboards 
Pubic lice crabs Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
They are a different type of louse from head lice and body lice 
The most common way to get pubic lice is through sexual activity 
Pubic lice feed on your blood, and their bites can cause severe itching 
Treatment includes applying over the counter creams and lotions that kill the parasites and their eggs 
SymptomsIf you have pubic lice crabs , you may experience intense itching in your genital region 
Pubic lice can spread to other areas with coarse body hair, including the 
When to see a doctorSeek medical advice about pubic lice treatment if 
Causes Pubic lice are most commonly spread during sexual activity 
You may also get pubic lice from infested sheets, blankets, towels or clothes 
Complications Pubic lice infestations can usually be treated with a louse killing lotion or gel 
However, a pubic lice infestation sometimes leads to complications such as 
Pale blue spots may develop where pubic lice have been feeding continually 
If itchy lice bites cause you to scratch yourself raw, these wounds can become infected 
If you are being treated for pubic lice, all sexual partners also must be treated 
Overview Cradle cap causes crusty or oily scaly patches on a baby s scalp 
But it can cause thick white or yellow scales that aren t easy to remove 
Cradle cap usually clears up on its own in weeks or a few months 
Home care measures include washing your baby s scalp daily with a mild shampoo 
Oily or dry skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales 
Similar scales also may be present on the ears, eyelids, nose and groin 
Cradle cap is the common term for infantile seborrheic dermatitis 
A major difference between these conditions is that atopic dermatitis can be very itchy 
When to see a doctorSee your baby s doctor or other health care professional if 
One factor may be hormones that pass from the mother to the baby before birth 
These hormones can cause oil glands and hair follicles to make too much oil 
Cradle cap isn t contagious, and it s not caused by poor hygiene 
Risk factors Cradle cap is very common in babies 
PreventionShampooing your baby s hair every few days can help prevent cradle cap 
Overview A muscle cramp is a sudden, unexpected tightening of one or more muscles 
Sometimes called a charley horse, a muscle cramp can be very painful 
Exercising or working hard, especially in heat, can lead to muscle cramps 
SymptomsMuscle cramps occur mostly in leg muscles, most often in the calf 
After the cramp eases, the area might be sore for hours or days 
When to see a doctorMuscle cramps usually go away on their own 
But some might be related to a medical concern, such as 
Pressure on the nerves in the spine also can cause cramping pain in the legs 
Walking bent slightly forward, such as when pushing a shopping cart, might ease cramping 
Too little potassium, calcium or magnesium in the diet can cause leg cramps 
Risk factors Factors that might increase the risk of muscle cramps include 
Then the muscles can t work as hard and can get stressed more easily 
Not being in shape for an activity causes muscles to tire more easily 
Keep drinking water or other liquids without caffeine or alcohol after the activity 
Stretch gently before and after using any muscle for a time 
To avoid getting leg cramps at night, stretch before bedtime 
Overview Menstrual cramps dysmenorrhea are throbbing or cramping pains in the lower abdomen 
Many women have menstrual cramps just before and during their menstrual periods 
Conditions such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids can cause menstrual cramps 
Throbbing or cramping pain in your lower abdomen that can be intense 
You just started having severe menstrual cramps after age 
Causes During your menstrual period, your uterus contracts to help expel its lining 
Hormonelike substances prostaglandins involved in pain and inflammation trigger the uterine muscle contractions 
Higher levels of prostaglandins are associated with more severe menstrual cramps 
These noncancerous growths in the wall of the uterus can cause pain 
This infection of the female reproductive organs is usually caused by sexually transmitted bacteria 
Risk factors You might be at risk of menstrual cramps if 
Certain conditions associated with menstrual cramps can have complications, though 
Craniopharyngioma begins as a growth of cells near the brain s pituitary gland 
The pituitary gland makes hormones that control many body functions 
Symptoms include changes in vision over time, fatigue, headaches and urinating more often 
Children with craniopharyngioma may grow slowly and may be smaller than expected 
DiagnosisDiagnosing a craniopharyngioma usually starts with a medical history review and a discussion of symptoms 
The pictures can show the size and location of the tumor 
Surgeons may remove as much of the craniopharyngioma as is safe 
Radiation therapy may be used after surgery to treat any tumor cells that remain 
Using surgery and radiation together often provides good tumor control 
This approach also helps lower the risk of complications after surgery 
Other treatments, such as chemotherapy and targeted therapy, might be options in certain situations 
SurgeryMost people with craniopharyngioma have surgery to remove all or most of the tumor 
What type of surgery you have depends on the location and size of the tumor 
Also called a craniotomy, this operation involves opening the skull to access the tumor 
Also called a transsphenoidal procedure, this operation uses special surgical tools inserted through the nose 
The tools go through a natural passage to get to the tumor 
However, there are often many delicate and important structures nearby 
Surgeons do the operation in a way that avoids hurting nearby structures during the operation 
Surgeons take care to reduce the risk of vision problems 
The hypothalamus helps with many functions, including controlling appetite and alertness 
Surgery is sometimes used to relieve a fluid backup on the brain, called hydrocephalus 
A permanent tube, called a shunt, can drain the brain fluid to the abdomen 
Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to control tumor cells 
Radiation therapy is often used after surgery to treat any tumor cells that are left 
These technologies include proton beam therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy, also called IMRT 
It aims many beams of radiation from many angles at the tumor 
Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment is typically completed in one or a few treatments 
This makes it less likely to damage nearby healthy tissue 
In adults, about one out of every three craniopharyngiomas is the papillary type 
Targeted therapy uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the tumor cells 
Nearly all papillary craniopharyngioma cells contain a change in their DNA called the BRAF gene 
Targeted therapy aimed at this change may be a treatment option 
Lab testing can show whether your craniopharyngioma contains papillary cells 
Overview Sudden infant death syndrome is the unexplained death of a baby 
The baby is usually less than a year old and seems to be healthy 
It is sometimes called crib death because infants often die in their cribs 
Researchers have found some things that might put babies at higher risk 
They ve also found some things you can do to help protect your child from SIDS 
The most important action may be to place a baby on the back to sleep 
Causes Both physical and sleep factors put an infant at risk of SIDS 
Some infants are born with problems that make them more likely to die of SIDS 
The baby may have less control over such automatic processes as breathing and heart rate 
Many infants who died of SIDS had recently had a cold 
Being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby s risk of SIDS 
But researchers have found several factors that might raise the risk 
Boys are slightly more likely than girls to die of SIDS 
Infants are at higher risk between the second and fourth months of life 
Babies with siblings who died of SIDS are at higher risk of SIDS 
Babies who live with smokers have a higher risk of SIDS 
Being born early and having a low birth weight increase a baby s chances of SIDS 
But you can help your baby sleep more safely by following these tips 
Place your baby to sleep in the correct position on the back 
This won t be needed once your baby can roll over both ways without help 
Don t put your baby on the stomach or side to sleep 
Short periods of tummy time help a baby build muscle strength 
But the baby should never be left alone during tummy time 
Make sure the mattress does not sit at an angle higher than degrees 
Avoid placing your baby on thick, fluffy padding, such as lambskin or a thick quilt 
Don t leave pillows, fluffy toys or stuffed animals in the crib 
They can cause problems with breathing if your baby s face presses against them 
Or dress your baby in layers instead of using blankets 
Your baby should sleep in the same room with you for at least six months 
A baby can become trapped and suffocate between the headboard slats 
Those are the spaces between the mattress and the bed frame 
A baby also can get trapped in the space between the mattress and the wall 
The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages the use of monitors and other devices 
And they cannot be used instead of safe sleep practices 
Sucking on a pacifier at nap time or bedtime may reduce the risk of SIDS 
Make sure the pacifier does not have a strap or cord 
It usually takes to weeks to set up a nursing routine 
If your baby is not interested in the pacifier, don t force it 
If the pacifier falls out while your baby is sleeping, don t put it back in 
There s no evidence that recommended shots to protect against diseases increase the risk of SIDS 
Some evidence shows that such shots may help prevent SIDS 
Overview Crohn s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease IBD 
This inflammation often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel 
Crohn s disease can be both painful and debilitating, and sometimes may lead to life threatening complications 
With treatment, many people with Crohn s disease are able to function well 
SymptomsIn Crohn s disease, any part of your small or large intestine can be involved 
It may involve multiple segments, or it may be continuous 
Signs and symptoms of Crohn s disease can range from mild to severe 
They usually develop gradually, but sometimes will come on suddenly, without warning 
You may also have periods of time when you have no signs or symptoms remission 
However, most people with Crohn s disease do not have a family history of the disease 
Risk factors Risk factors for Crohn s disease may include 
Most people who develop Crohn s disease are diagnosed before they re around years old 
Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn s disease 
Smoking also leads to more severe disease and a greater risk of having surgery 
These include ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others , naproxen sodium Aleve , diclofenac sodium and others 
Complications Crohn s disease may lead to one or more of the following complications 
Crohn s disease can affect the entire thickness of the intestinal wall 
Fistulas near or around the anal area perianal are the most common kind 
It s often associated with painful bowel movements and may lead to a perianal fistula 
Having Crohn s disease that affects your colon increases your risk of colon cancer 
Ask your doctor whether you need to have this test done sooner and more frequently 
Many people with Crohn s disease may also develop a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa 
Crohn s disease can also cause problems in other parts of the body 
Among these problems are low iron anemia , osteoporosis, arthritis, and gallbladder or liver disease 
Work with your doctor to determine risks and benefits of medications 
Crohn s disease increases the risk of blood clots in veins and arteries 
Taking a breath often produces a high pitched whistling sound called stridor 
If there s enough swelling, irritation and coughing, a child can develop 
Makes noisy, high pitched breathing sounds when breathing both in and out 
Seems anxious, upset and restless or extra tired and has no energy 
Causes Croup is usually caused by a viral infection, most often a parainfluenza virus 
Virus particles in these droplets may also survive on toys and other surfaces 
Because children have small airways, they re likely to have more symptoms with croup 
Croup rarely occurs in children older than years of age 
In a small number of children, the airway swells enough to cause problems with breathing 
Rarely, a bacterial infection of the windpipe can occur in addition to the viral infection 
This can result in trouble breathing and requires emergency medical care 
PreventionTo prevent croup, take the same steps you use to prevent colds and flu 
Encourage your child to cough or sneeze into the elbow 
To prevent more serious infections that may cause croup, keep your child s vaccinations up to date 
There isn t a vaccine yet that protects against parainfluenza viruses 
Overview Cryoglobulinemia is a family of rare conditions, called vasculitis 
Vasculitis causes irritation and swelling, called inflammation, of the blood vessels 
This can damage the skin, joints, nerves and organs, mainly the kidneys and liver 
This type has one kind of atypical protein, called monoclonal 
This has two types of atypical protein, both monoclonal and polyclonal 
Type II most often is linked to hepatitis C virus 
Type most often is linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 
For people who have symptoms, the symptoms might come and go 
Most people with cryoglobulinemia get purple skin spots, called lesions, on their legs 
On Black or brown skin, the spots might look black or brown 
Symptoms like those of rheumatoid arthritis are common in cryoglobulinemia 
Cryoglobulinemia can damage the nerves at the tips of the fingers and toes 
Hepatitis C is the most common infection linked to cryoglobulinemia 
Risk factors Risk factors of cryoglobulinemia may include 
The main symptoms are protein or blood in the urine 
High blood pressure most often goes with the kidney symptoms 
An undescended testicle is more common in premature babies than it is in full term infants 
With an undescended testicle, that process stops or is delayed 
A retractile testicle, which moves back and forth between the scrotum and the groin 
The testicle might be easily guided by hand into the scrotum during a physical exam 
A retractile testicle is due to a muscle reflex in the scrotum 
The testicle can t be easily guided by hand into the scrotum 
Causes The exact cause of an undescended testicle isn t known 
Genes, the health of the baby s mother and other factors might have a combined effect 
Complications of a testicle not being located where it s supposed to be include 
Men who ve had an undescended testicle have a higher risk of testicular cancer 
This disease often begins in testicle cells that make immature sperm 
The risk also is higher when both testicles are affected 
Surgery to correct an undescended testicle might lower the risk of testicular cancer 
These problems make it harder to get a partner pregnant 
They re more likely to happen in men who ve had an undescended testicle 
This is the twisting of the cord that brings blood to the scrotum 
It s a painful problem that cuts off blood to the testicle 
In cutaneous T cell lymphoma, the T cells develop abnormalities that make them attack the skin 
Sezary syndrome is a less common type that causes skin redness over the entire body 
Treatments can include skin creams, light therapy, radiation therapy and systemic medications, such as chemotherapy 
Cutaneous T cell lymphoma is one of several types of lymphoma collectively called non Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Round patches of skin that may be raised or scaly and might be itchy 
Patches of skin that appear lighter in color than surrounding skin 
Lumps that form on the skin and may break open 
Thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet 
A rash like skin redness over the entire body that is intensely itchy 
Causes The exact cause of cutaneous T cell lymphoma isn t known 
In general, cancer begins when cells develop changes mutations in their DNA 
A cell s DNA contains instructions that tell a cell what to do 
The DNA mutations tell the cells to grow and multiply rapidly, creating many abnormal cells 
So having a curved erection isn t always a cause for concern 
But Peyronie disease causes a serious bend or pain in some people 
For many people, Peyronie disease also causes stress and anxiety 
SymptomsPeyronie disease symptoms might start suddenly or appear over time 
The scar tissue linked with Peyronie disease also is called plaque 
It s different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels or on your teeth 
The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side 
Peyronie disease might cause problems getting or keeping an erection 
The penis might become shorter during erections due to Peyronie disease 
In some people with Peyronie disease, the erect penis might look narrow or indented 
The curving and penile shortening linked with Peyronie disease might become worse over time 
Pain during erections usually gets better within to years 
But the penis also could be damaged during athletic activities or accidents 
Many people with Peyronie disease can t recall a specific injury that led to their symptoms 
During the healing process after injury to the penis, scar tissue forms 
Each side of the penis contains a spongelike tube called a corpus cavernosum 
When you become sexually aroused, more blood flows to these chambers 
As the chambers fill with blood, the penis expands, straightens and stiffens into an erection 
As a result, the penis bends or goes through other changes 
Risk factors Minor injury to the penis doesn t always lead to Peyronie disease 
If a family member has Peyronie disease, you have a higher risk of the condition 
But it becomes more common between the ages of and 
Curving of the penis in younger men less often is due to Peyronie disease 
A small amount of curvature in younger men is typical and not concerning 
These include certain health conditions, smoking and some types of prostate surgery 
Trouble getting or keeping an erection, also called erectile dysfunction 
Anxiety, stress, or depression over challenges having sex or the way your penis looks 
Trouble having a child because it s challenging or not possible to have sex 
Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some curves worsen as children grow 
Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening 
One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other 
A prominence on one side of the back when bending forward 
This causes the ribs or muscles on one side of the body to stick ou 
Occasionally, teachers, friends and sports teammates are the first to notice a child s scoliosis 
Certain neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy 
Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine 
Cushing syndrome also can cause high blood pressure or bone loss 
Treatments for Cushing syndrome can lower the body s cortisol levels and improve symptoms 
The sooner treatment starts, the better the chances for recovery 
SymptomsSymptoms of Cushing syndrome can vary depending on the level of extra cortisol 
Weight gain in the trunk, with thin arms and legs 
Pink or purple stretch marks on the stomach, hips, thighs, breasts and underarms 
Causes Cushing syndrome is caused by having too much cortisol in the body 
Cortisol is a hormone that is made in the adrenal glands 
It helps the body respond to stress and plays many other important roles, including 
The role of glucocorticoid medicines exogenous Cushing syndrome Cushing syndrome can happen from taking glucocorticoid medicines 
These are often used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and asthma 
Some tumors make ACTH, which creates more cortisol and can cause Cushing syndrome 
Problems with the adrenal glands also can affect cortisol and cause Cushing syndrome 
When Cushing syndrome happens this way, it may be caused by 
Pituitary adenomas are tumors that grow in the pituitary gland 
They are found at the base of the brain and are usually not cancer 
When Cushing syndrome happens this way, it s called Cushing disease 
They are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland 
Problems with the adrenal glands can cause them to make too much cortisol 
These tumors are not cancer, and only some make too much cortisol 
If these tumors make ACTH or cortisol, Cushing syndrome can happen 
Bone loss, also called osteoporosis, which can lead to broken bones 
Cutaneous B cell lymphoma starts in one type of germ fighting white blood cell called B cells 
Cutaneous B cell lymphoma symptoms include a firm bump under the skin 
The bump might be the same color as your skin 
Or it might be a darker color or look pink or purple 
DiagnosisTests and procedures used to diagnose cutaneous B cell lymphoma include 
Your provider may remove a small part of the skin lesion 
The sample is tested in a lab to look for lymphoma cells 
A sample of your blood may be analyzed to look for lymphoma cells 
A sample of your bone marrow may be tested to look for lymphoma cells 
Examples of imaging tests include computerized tomography CT and positron emission tomography PET 
TreatmentCutaneous B cell lymphoma treatment depends on the specific type of lymphoma that you have 
Radiation therapy can be used alone to treat cutaneous lymphoma 
Sometimes it s used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might be left 
This treatment is sometimes used for cutaneous lymphoma that grows very slowly 
Chemotherapy drugs can be applied to the skin to control cutaneous lymphoma 
This might be used if the cancer is growing quickly or is advanced 
Targeted therapy drugs attack specific chemicals present in cancer cells 
By blocking these chemicals, targeted drug treatments cause cancer cells to die 
Targeted therapy drugs can be injected into the cancer to treat cutaneous lymphoma 
Getting the proper treatment can help you learn healthier ways to cope 
Keeping sharp objects or other items used for self injury on hand 
Wearing long sleeves or long pants to hide self injury, even in hot weather 
Behaviors and emotions that change quickly and are impulsive, intense and unexpected 
Cutting, scratching or stabbing with a sharp object, one of the most common methods 
Burning with lit matches, cigarettes or heated, sharp objects such as knives 
Most frequently, the arms, legs, chest and belly are the targets of self injury 
Many people self injure only a few times and then stop 
But for others, self injury can become a longer term, repeated behavior 
Any form of self injury is a sign of bigger stressors that need attention 
They can help you take the first steps to successful treatment 
Express your concern, but don t yell at your child or make threats or accusations 
Gently express your concern and encourage the person to seek medical and mental health treatment 
Seek help from your school nurse or counselor, teacher, or health care provider 
Contact a spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community 
Causes There s no one single or simple cause that leads someone to self injure 
Having a hard time controlling, expressing or understanding emotions may lead to self injury 
For example, there may be feelings of worthlessness, loneliness, panic, anger, guilt, rejection and self hatred 
Manage or reduce severe distress or anxiety and provide a sense of relief 
Feel a sense of control over the body, feelings or life situations 
Feel something anything even if it s physical pain, when feeling emotionally empty 
Communicate feelings of stress or depression to the outside world 
Having friends who intentionally harm themselves makes it more likely for someone to begin self injuring 
So can growing up and remaining in an unstable family environment 
Other risk factors include questioning personal or sexual identity and social isolation 
Being highly self critical and struggling with problem solving increases the risk of self injury 
Being under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs may increase the risk of self injury 
Worsening of underlying issues and conditions, if not properly treated 
PreventionThere is no sure way to prevent someone s self injuring behavior 
But reducing the risk of self injury includes strategies that involve both individuals and communities 
Parents, family members, teachers, school nurses, coaches or friends can help 
The person can learn healthy coping skills to use during periods of distress 
Feeling lonely and disconnected may be a part of self injury 
Learn about the warning signs of self injury and what to do when you suspect it 
Teaching children critical thinking skills about the influences around them might reduce the harmful impact 
Cyclic vomiting syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Episodes can last for hours or days and alternate with symptom free periods 
Although it s more common in children, the number of cases diagnosed in adults is increasing 
The syndrome is difficult to diagnose because vomiting is a symptom of many disorders 
Treatment often involves lifestyle changes to help prevent the events that can trigger vomiting episodes 
Medications, including anti nausea and migraine therapies, may help lessen symptoms 
SymptomsThe symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome often begin in the morning 
Varying intervals of generally normal health without nausea between episodes 
Other signs and symptoms during a vomiting episode may include 
Continued vomiting may cause severe dehydration that can be life threatening 
Call your doctor if you or your child is showing symptoms of dehydration, such as 
Some possible causes include genes, digestive difficulties, nervous system problems and hormone imbalances 
Certain foods and drinks, such as alcohol, caffeine, chocolate or cheese 
Identifying the triggers for vomiting episodes may help with managing cyclic vomiting syndrome 
Risk factors The relationship between migraines and cyclic vomiting syndrome isn t clear 
People with this syndrome often demonstrate frequent showering or bathing behavior 
Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome can be confused with cyclic vomiting syndrome 
If it doesn t, your doctor will continue testing for cyclic vomiting syndrome 
Severe cases of dehydration may need to be treated in the hospital 
For children, downplaying the importance of upcoming events because excitement can be a trigger 
Avoiding trigger foods, such as alcohol, caffeine, cheese and chocolate 
Eating small meals and low fat snacks daily at regular times 
Overview Cyclothymia sy kloe THIE me uh , also called cyclothymic disorder, is a rare mood disorder 
Between these cyclothymic highs and lows, you may feel stable and fine 
The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood hypomanic symptoms 
Signs and symptoms of the highs of cyclothymia may include 
Poor judgment that can result in risky behavior or unwise choices 
Increased drive to perform or achieve goals sexual, work related or social 
Signs and symptoms of the lows of cyclothymia may include 
If you have any symptoms of cyclothymia, seek medical help as soon as possible 
Call or your local emergency services number, or go to a hospital emergency department 
Differences in the way the brain works, such as changes in the brain s neurobiology 
Environmental issues, such as traumatic experiences or prolonged periods of stress 
Risk factors Cyclothymia is thought to be relatively rare 
Cyclothymia typically starts during the teenage years or young adulthood 
It affects about the same number of males and females 
There is a high risk of later developing bipolar I or II disorder 
You may be at increased risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide 
Ganglion cysts are typically round or oval and are filled with a jellylike fluid 
Ganglion cysts can be painful if they press on a nearby nerve 
But if there are no symptoms, no treatment is necessary 
Ganglion cysts most often develop along the tendons or joints of wrists or hands 
The next most common locations are the ankles and feet 
The size of a cyst can change, often getting larger over time with joint movement 
You can get a diagnosis and find out whether you need treatment 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of ganglion cysts include 
Joints or tendons that have been injured are more likely to develop ganglion cysts 
Overview Kidney cysts are round pouches of fluid that form on or in the kidneys 
Kidney cysts can occur with disorders that may impair kidney function 
But more often, kidney cysts are a type called simple kidney cysts 
Often, one cyst occurs on the surface of a kidney 
But more than one cyst can appear on one or both kidneys 
Simple kidney cysts aren t the same as cysts that form with polycystic kidney disease 
Complex cysts need to be watched for changes that could be cancer 
Simple kidney cysts are often found during an imaging test for another condition 
But if a simple kidney cyst grows large enough, symptoms may include 
The pouch then fills with fluid, detaches and develops into a cyst 
Risk factors The risk of having simple kidney cysts increases as you get older 
A kidney cyst may become infected, causing fever and pain 
A kidney cyst that bursts causes severe pain in the back or side 
Sometimes a burst cyst may cause blood in the urine 
A kidney cyst that blocks the typical flow of urine may lead to kidney swelling 
One ovary is located on each side of the uterus 
Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond 
Eggs are released in monthly cycles during the childbearing years 
Most of the time, you have little or no discomfort, and the cysts are harmless 
Most cysts go away without treatment within a few months 
But sometimes ovarian cysts can become twisted or burst open rupture 
SymptomsMost ovarian cysts cause no symptoms and go away on their own 
When to see a doctorGet immediate medical help if you have 
These include cold, clammy skin rapid breathing and lightheadedness or weakness 
Causes Most ovarian cysts form as a result of your menstrual cycle 
Functional cystsYour ovaries grow small cysts called follicles each month 
A monthly follicle that keeps growing is known as a functional cyst 
About halfway through your menstrual cycle, an egg bursts out of its follicle 
After a follicle releases its egg, it shrinks and begins producing estrogen and progesterone 
Sometimes, the opening where the egg came from gets blocked 
Fluid builds up inside the corpus luteum, causing a cyst 
Other cystsThere are other types of cysts that are not related to menstrual cycles 
The cyst can contain tissue, such as hair, skin or teeth 
This type of cyst develops from cells on the surface of an ovary 
The cyst might be filled with a watery or mucous material 
Some of the tissue can attach to the ovary and form a cyst 
Dermoid cysts and cystadenomas can become large and move the ovary out of position 
This increases the chance of painful twisting of the ovary, called ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion may reduce or stop blood flow to the ovary 
Risk factors The risk of having an ovarian cyst is higher with 
Sometimes, the follicle that forms when you ovulate stays on your ovary throughout pregnancy 
Some of the tissue can attach to your ovary and form a cyst 
If the infection spreads to the ovaries, it can cause cysts 
If you ve had one ovarian cyst, you re likely to develop more 
Complications They don t happen often, but complications can occur with ovarian cysts 
Cysts that become large can cause the ovary to move 
This increases the chance of painful twisting of the ovary ovarian torsion 
If this happens, you might have sudden, severe pelvic pain and nausea and vomiting 
Ovarian torsion can also reduce or stop blood flow to the ovary 
A cyst that bursts open ruptures can cause severe pain and bleeding inside the pelvis 
The larger the cyst, the greater the risk of rupture 
Talk to your health care provider about changes that concern you 
Pancreatic cysts Overview Pancreatic cysts are saclike pockets of fluid on or in your pancreas 
Pancreatic cysts are typically found during imaging testing for another problem 
But some pancreatic cysts can be or can become cancerous 
Or your doctor might recommend monitoring a cyst over time for changes that indicate cancer 
When signs or symptoms of pancreatic cysts do occur, they typically include 
See a doctor if you have a fever and persistent abdominal pain 
A ruptured pancreatic cyst can be a medical emergency, but fortunately is rare 
A ruptured cyst can also cause infection of the abdominal cavity peritonitis 
Pseudocysts can also result from injury to the abdomen, such as from a car accident 
If gallstones are triggering pancreatitis, you may need to have your gallbladder removed 
If your pancreatitis is due to alcohol use, not drinking can reduce your risk 
The cyst is almost always near the tailbone at the top of the buttocks 
Pilonidal cysts usually occur when hair punctures the skin and then becomes embedded 
If a pilonidal cyst becomes infected, it can be very painful 
The cyst can be drained through a small cut in the skin 
Pilonidal cysts are most common in young adult males, and the problem tends to recur 
But if it s infected, the skin around the cyst may be swollen and painful 
Pus or blood leaking from an opening in the skin 
Causes The cause of most pilonidal cysts is loose hairs that puncture the skin 
The body creates a cyst around the hair to try to push it out 
People who groom animals or cut hair can develop a cyst between their fingers 
Risk factors Factors that might increase your risk of a pilonidal cyst include 
If a spermatocele grows large enough to cause discomfort, your doctor might suggest surgery 
SymptomsA spermatocele usually causes no signs or symptoms and might remain stable in size 
Also, call your doctor if you experience pain or swelling in your scrotum 
A number of conditions can cause testicular pain, and some require immediate treatment 
Risk factors There aren t many known risk factors for developing a spermatocele 
Any new mass in your scrotum should be evaluated promptly 
Look for any swelling on the skin of the scrotum 
Gently roll the testicle between the thumbs and the fingers 
Remember that the testicles are usually smooth, oval shaped and somewhat firm 
It s normal for one testicle to be slightly larger than the other 
If you find a lump, call your doctor as soon as possible 
Your doctor normally checks your testicles whenever you have a physical exam 
Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices 
Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease 
Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes 
Some people may not experience symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood 
People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat 
Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children 
Cystic fibrosis requires consistent, regular follow up with your doctor, at least every three months 
The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition 
If children inherit only one copy, they won t develop cystic fibrosis 
However, they will be carriers and could pass the gene to their own children 
People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia 
Infection with bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics and difficult to treat is common 
Bronchiectasis can occur next to blood vessels in the lungs 
The combination of airway damage and infection can result in coughing up blood 
Often this is only a small amount of blood, but it can also be life threatening 
Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works 
Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life threatening 
This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment with antibiotics 
Sometimes treatment can be provided at home, but hospitalization may be needed 
Decreased energy and weight loss also are common during exacerbations 
This can result in delayed growth, weight loss or inflammation of the pancreas 
The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar 
About of teenagers and to of adults with CF develop diabetes 
Intestinal blockage can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages 
DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine 
People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones 
They may also experience joint pain, arthritis and muscle pain 
This makes them prone to dehydration, especially with exercise or in hot weather 
Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure 
Dealing with a chronic illness that has no cure may cause fear, depression and anxiety 
Overview Epidermoid ep ih DUR moid cysts are noncancerous small bumps beneath the skin 
Many people refer to epidermoid cysts as sebaceous cysts, but they re different 
A small, round bump under the skin, usually on the face, neck or trunk 
A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst 
A thick, yellow, smelly material that sometimes drains from the cyst 
Redness, swelling and tenderness in the area, if inflamed or infected 
When to see a doctorMost epidermoid cysts don t cause problems or need treatment 
See your doctor if you have one or more that 
Is in an unusual location, such as a finger and toe 
The keratin is the thick, yellow substance that sometimes drains from the cyst 
An epidermoid cyst can become tender and swollen, even if it s not infected 
Your doctor is likely to postpone removing it until the inflammation subsides 
A ruptured cyst often leads to a boil like infection that requires prompt treatment 
In very rare cases, epidermoid cysts can lead to skin cancer 
Cytomegalovirus CMV infection Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Cytomegalovirus CMV infection Overview Cytomegalovirus CMV is a common virus 
If you re pregnant or if your immune system is weakened, CMV is cause for concern 
There is no cure, but there are medications that can help treat the symptoms 
SymptomsMost healthy people who are infected with CMV may experience no symptoms 
People who are more likely to experience signs and symptoms of CMV include 
Newborns who became infected with CMV before they were born congenital CMV 
Infants who become infected during birth or shortly afterward perinatal CMV 
BabiesMost babies who have congenital CMV appear healthy at birth 
The most common of these late occurring signs are hearing loss and developmental delay 
A small number of babies may also develop vision problems 
When first infected, some adults may have symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis, including 
You have a weakened immune system and you re experiencing symptoms of CMV infection 
For people who have weakened immune systems, CMV infection can be serious or even fatal 
People who have undergone stem cell or organ transplants seem to be at greatest risk 
The doctor will likely assess your baby for hearing or vision problems 
Causes CMV is related to the viruses that cause chickenpox, herpes simplex and mononucleosis 
CMV may cycle through periods when it lies dormant and then reactivates 
Casual contact doesn t transmit CMV Ways the virus can be transmitted include 
Organ, bone marrow or stem cell transplantation or blood transfusions 
An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby before or during birth 
Risk factors CMV is a widespread and common virus that can infect almost anyone 
Healthy adultsRarely, CMV causes a healthy adult to develop mononucleosis 
People who have weakened immunity Complications of CMV infection can include 
Vision loss, due to inflammation of the light sensing layer of the eye retinitis 
Digestive system problems, including inflammation of the colon colitis , esophagus esophagitis and liver hepatitis 
This is especially important if the children attend child care 
Avoid contact with tears and saliva when you kiss a child 
Instead of kissing a child on the lips, for instance, kiss on the forehead 
Avoid sharing food or drinking out of the same glass as others 
Clean any surfaces that come in contact with children s urine or saliva 
Wear a condom during sexual contact to prevent spreading CMV through semen and vaginal fluids 
Experimental vaccines are being tested for women of childbearing age 
Overview Dandruff is a common condition that causes the skin on the scalp to flake 
Mild dandruff can be treated with a gentle daily shampoo 
Skin flakes on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache, and shoulders 
When to see a doctorMost people with dandruff don t require a doctor s care 
A yeastlike fungus malassezia that feeds on oils on the scalps of most adults 
Dandruff usually begins in young adulthood and continues through middle age 
Overview Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that makes people very drowsy during the day 
People with narcolepsy find it hard to stay awake for long periods of time 
Sometimes narcolepsy also causes a sudden loss of muscle tone, known as cataplexy KAT uh plek see 
Most people who don t have cataplexy have type narcolepsy 
Narcolepsy is a life long condition for which there s no cure 
However, medicines and lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms 
SymptomsThe symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years of the disorder 
It may happen when you re bored or during a task 
For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly fall asleep 
It can be especially dangerous if you fall asleep while driving 
You might fall asleep for only a few minutes or up to a half hour 
After waking, you ll often feel refreshed but you ll get sleepy again 
Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly 
For example, you may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving 
It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles 
But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone 
For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control 
Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall 
Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year 
During sleep paralysis, you can t move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking 
It s usually brief lasting a few seconds or minutes 
You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward 
Sometimes people see things that aren t there during sleep paralysis 
These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep 
For example, you might feel as if there is a stranger in your bedroom 
Typically, people enter REM sleep to minutes after falling asleep 
But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep 
They tend to enter REM sleep within minutes of falling asleep 
REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day 
They might have obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing starts and stops during the night 
Or they may act out their dreams, known as REM sleep behavior disorder 
Or they may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, called insomnia 
People with type narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin hi poe KREE tin , also called orexin 
Exactly what causes the loss of hypocretin producing cells in the brain isn t known 
An autoimmune reaction is when the body s immune system destroys its own cells 
It s also likely that genetics plays a role in narcolepsy 
It also may be linked to a certain form of the H N vaccine 
After an hour or so of NREM sleep, brain activity changes and REM sleep begins 
In narcolepsy, you may suddenly enter REM sleep without going through NREM sleep 
This can happen both at night and during the day 
Cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hallucinations are similar to changes that occur in REM sleep 
But in narcolepsy they happen while you re awake or drowsy 
Risk factors There are only a few known risk factors for narcolepsy, including 
Narcolepsy can cause problems at work or in your personal life 
Others might see people with narcolepsy as lazy or lethargic 
Intense feelings, such as anger or joy, can trigger cataplexy 
This can cause people with narcolepsy to withdraw from emotional interactions 
You re at increased risk of a car accident if you fall asleep while driving 
Your risk of cuts and burns is greater if you fall asleep while cooking 
A clinical trial studying active monitoring as an alternative to surgery may be another option 
Most groups recommend considering routine breast cancer screening beginning in your s 
DCIS forms when genetic mutations occur in the DNA of breast duct cells 
Researchers don t know exactly what triggers the abnormal cell growth that leads to DCIS 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of DCIS include 
Personal history of benign breast disease, such as atypical hyperplasia 
Difficulty moving the thumb and wrist when doing something that involves grasping or pinching 
A sticking or stop and go sensation in the thumb when moving it 
Moving the thumb and wrist may make the pain worse 
Using nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others and naproxen sodium Aleve 
Causes De Quervain tenosynovitis affects the two tendons on the thumb side of the wrist 
If the covering becomes irritated, the tendons can thicken and swell 
Fluid retention, such as from changes in hormones during pregnancy 
Risk factors Risk factors for de Quervain tenosynovitis include 
Jobs or hobbies that involve repetitive hand and wrist motions 
This tear instability leads to inflammation and damage of the eye s surface 
If you have dry eyes, your eyes may sting or burn 
You ll likely need to take these measures indefinitely to control the symptoms of dry eyes 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms, which usually affect both eyes, may include 
Watery eyes, which is the body s response to the irritation of dry eyes 
Your tear film has three layers fatty oils, aqueous fluid and mucus 
This combination usually keeps the surface of your eyes lubricated, smooth and clear 
Problems with any of these layers can cause dry eyes 
The medical term for this condition is keratoconjunctivitis sicca ker uh toe kun junk tih VY tis SIK uh 
Blocked meibomian glands are more common in people with rosacea or other skin disorders 
Eyelid problems, such as the lids turning outward ectropion and the lids turning inward entropion 
Risk factors Factors that make it more likely that you ll experience dry eyes include 
Wearing contact lenses or having a history of refractive surgery 
Complications People who have dry eyes may experience these complications 
Your tears protect the surface of your eyes from infection 
Without adequate tears, you may have an increased risk of eye infection 
Dry eyes can make it difficult to perform everyday activities, such as reading 
Then find ways to avoid those situations in order to prevent your dry eyes symptoms 
Don t direct hair dryers, car heaters, air conditioners or fans toward your eyes 
In winter, a humidifier can add moisture to dry indoor air 
If you re reading or doing another task that requires visual concentration, take periodic eye breaks 
The air at high altitudes, in desert areas and in airplanes can be extremely dry 
This may help slow the evaporation of your tears between eye blinks 
If you don t smoke, stay away from people who do 
Deep vein thrombosis DVT Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Deep vein thrombosis can be serious because blood clots in the veins can break loose 
Leg pain, cramping or soreness that often starts in the calf 
When to see a doctorIf you develop symptoms of DVT, contact your health care provider 
The warning signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include 
Risk factors Many things can increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis DVT 
The more risk factors you have, the greater your risk of DVT 
When the legs don t move for a long time, the calf muscles don t squeeze contract 
Injury to the veins or surgery can increase the risk of blood clots 
Pregnancy increases the pressure in the veins in the pelvis and legs 
People with an inherited clotting disorder are especially at risk 
Being overweight increases the pressure in the veins in the pelvis and legs 
Smoking affects how blood flows and clots, which can increase the risk of DVT 
Some cancers increase substances in the blood that cause the blood to clot 
Some types of cancer treatment also increase the risk of blood clots 
Heart failure increases the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism 
Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis increase the risk of DVT 
A personal or family history of DVT or pulmonary embolism PE 
Some people have DNA changes that cause the blood to clot more easily 
This inherited disorder changes one of the clotting factors in the blood 
Sometimes, a blood clot in a vein can occur with no identifiable risk factor 
Get immediate medical help if you have symptoms of PE 
Damage to the veins from the blood clot reduces blood flow in the affected areas 
Symptoms include leg pain, leg swelling, skin color changes and skin sores 
Bleeding hemorrhage is a worrisome side effect of blood thinners 
It s important to have regular blood tests while taking blood thinning drugs 
If you re traveling by car, stop every hour or so and walk around 
Raise and lower your heels while keeping your toes on the floor 
Then raise your toes while keeping your heels on the floor 
If you don t replace lost fluids, you will get dehydrated 
The most common cause of dehydration in young children is severe diarrhea and vomiting 
SymptomsThirst isn t always a reliable early indicator of the body s need for water 
Many people, particularly older adults, don t feel thirsty until they re already dehydrated 
That s why it s important to increase water intake during hot weather or when you re ill 
The signs and symptoms of dehydration also may differ by age 
When to see a doctorCall your family doctor if you or a loved one 
Is irritable or disoriented and much sleepier or less active than usual 
If you have vomiting along with diarrhea, you lose even more fluids and minerals 
In general, the higher your fever, the more dehydrated you may become 
The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting 
Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose 
Risk factors Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain people are at greater risk 
Having uncontrolled or untreated diabetes puts you at high risk of dehydration 
Kidney disease also increases your risk, as do medications that increase urination 
When it s hot and humid, your risk of dehydration and heat illness increases 
This is one of the most serious, and sometimes life threatening, complications of dehydration 
Letting thirst be your guide is an adequate daily guideline for most healthy people 
People may need to take in more fluids if they are experiencing conditions such as 
In general, it s best to start hydrating the day before strenuous exercise 
Producing lots of clear, dilute urine is a good indication that you re well hydrated 
Make sure to drink extra fluids when you re not feeling well 
Some men with delayed ejaculation are unable to ejaculate at all 
Possible causes of delayed ejaculation include certain chronic health conditions, surgeries and medications 
It s normal for men to have delayed ejaculation from time to time 
Other men might not be able to ejaculate at all anejaculation 
But, there s no specific time that indicates a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation 
Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms 
With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity 
Acquired delayed ejaculation occurs after a period of normal sexual functioning 
Generalized delayed ejaculation isn t limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of stimulation 
Delayed ejaculation is an issue for you or your partner 
You have other symptoms along with delayed ejaculation that might or might not seem related 
Causes Delayed ejaculation can result from medications, certain chronic health conditions and surgeries 
In many cases, it is due to a combination of physical and psychological concerns 
Relationship problems due to stress, poor communication or other concerns 
Differences between the reality of sex with a partner and sexual fantasies 
Medications and other substances that can cause delayed ejaculation include 
Alcohol particularly drinking too much excessive alcohol use or alcoholism 
Prostate surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate or prostate removal 
Neurological diseases, such as diabetic neuropathy, stroke or nerve damage to the spinal cord 
Hormone related conditions, such as low thyroid hormone level hypothyroidism or low testosterone level hypogonadism 
Older age as men age, it s normal for ejaculation to take longer 
Medications, particularly certain antidepressants, high blood pressure medications or diuretics 
Excessive alcohol use, especially if you re a long term heavy drinker 
Marital or relationship problems due to an unsatisfactory sex life 
Ordinarily, strong muscular contractions propel food through your digestive tract 
Sometimes it s a complication of diabetes, and some people develop gastroparesis after surgery 
For people who already have gastroparesis, these medications may make their condition worse 
Gastroparesis can interfere with normal digestion, cause nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain 
It can also cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition 
A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites 
Many people with gastroparesis don t have any noticeable signs and symptoms 
A damaged vagus nerve can t send signals normally to your stomach muscles 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of gastroparesis 
Certain medications that slow the rate of stomach emptying, such as narcotic pain medications 
Nervous system diseases, such as Parkinson s disease or multiple sclerosis 
Women are more likely to develop gastroparesis than are men 
Undigested food in your stomach can harden into a solid mass called a bezoar 
In turn, poor control of blood sugar levels makes gastroparesis worse 
Symptoms can make it difficult to work and keep up with other responsibilities 
This makes it hard to wake in time for work or school 
Delayed sleep phase also is known as delayed sleep wake phase disorder 
They last at least three months and often for years 
Not being able to fall asleep at a typical bedtime, known as insomnia 
Trouble waking up in the morning in time to go to work or school 
Known as circadian rhythm, your internal clock is on a hour cycle 
But circadian rhythms can be delayed in teenagers for biological reasons 
Risk factors Delayed sleep phase can affect children and adults of any age 
However, delayed sleep phase is more common among teenagers and young adults 
It results in confused thinking and a lack of awareness of someone s surroundings 
The disorder usually comes on fast within hours or a few days 
Delirium can often be traced to one or more factors 
Symptoms of delirium are sometimes confused with symptoms of dementia 
SymptomsSymptoms of delirium usually begin over a few hours or a few days 
Symptoms tend to be worse at night when it s dark and things look less familiar 
Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions 
Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to surroundings 
People with this type may be restless and pace the room 
They also may be anxious, have rapid mood swings or see things that aren t there 
People with this type may be inactive or have reduced activity 
The person may quickly switch back and forth from being restless and sluggish 
However, episodes of delirium don t always mean a person has dementia 
Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include 
The onset of delirium occurs within a short time within a day or two 
Dementia usually begins with minor symptoms that get worse over time 
The ability to stay focused or maintain focus is impaired with delirium 
A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert 
Delirium symptoms can come and go several times during the day 
Your input about symptoms, typical thinking and usual abilities will be important for a diagnosis 
It also can help the provider find the cause of the disorder 
Causes Delirium occurs when signals in the brain aren t sent and received properly 
The disorder may have a single cause or more than one cause 
An imbalance in the body, such as low sodium or low calcium 
Severe, long lasting illness or an illness that will lead to death 
Urinary tract infection, pneumonia, the flu or COVID , especially in older adults 
Exposure to a toxin, such as carbon monoxide, cyanide or other poisons 
Poor nutrition or a loss of too much body fluid 
Surgery or another medical procedure that requires being put in a sleep like state 
Some medicines taken alone or taken in combination can trigger delirium 
Delirium is more common in older adults and in people who live in nursing homes 
Examples of other conditions that may increase the risk of delirium include 
If the causes are addressed, the recovery time is often shorter 
Recovery depends to some extent on the health and mental status before symptoms began 
People in better health are more likely to fully recover 
Delirium in seriously ill people is more likely to lead to 
Hospital stays often involve room changes, invasive procedures, loud noises and poor lighting 
Lack of natural light and lack of sleep can make confusion worse 
Some steps can help prevent or reduce the severity of delirium 
Also avoid medicines used for sleep, such as diphenhydramine Benadryl Allergy, Unisom, others 
In people who have dementia, the symptoms interfere with their daily lives 
It s often one of the early symptoms of the condition 
But having memory loss alone doesn t mean you have dementia 
Depending on the cause, some dementia symptoms might be reversible 
Trouble with visual and spatial abilities, such as getting lost while driving 
Some medical conditions that cause dementia symptoms can be treated 
The symptoms depend on the area of the brain that s damaged 
Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common 
And some medicines can cause a reaction that includes dementia symptoms 
Not getting enough of certain vitamins or minerals also can cause dementia symptoms 
These gene changes can be passed down from parent to child 
People with Alzheimer s disease have plaques and tangles in their brains 
It s thought that these clumps damage healthy brain cells and the fibers connecting them 
Lewy body dementia is one of the more common types of dementia 
Other signs include uncoordinated or slow movement, tremors, and stiffness, known as parkinsonism 
Common symptoms affect behavior, personality, thinking, judgment, language and movement 
People with mixed dementia can have Alzheimer s disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia 
Studies are ongoing to determine how having mixed dementia affects symptoms and treatments 
The disease causes certain nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to waste away 
Symptoms include a decline in thinking skills, known as cognitive skills 
This condition is most often caused by repetitive head trauma 
Dementia symptoms depend on the part of the brain that s injured 
TBI can cause depression, explosiveness, memory loss and impaired speech 
This rare brain disorder usually occurs in people without known risk factors 
This condition might be due to deposits of infectious proteins called prions 
Symptoms of this fatal condition usually appear after age 
Dementia like conditions that can be reversedSome causes of dementia like symptoms can be reversed with treatment 
Not getting enough of certain vitamins or minerals in your diet can cause dementia symptoms 
Subdural bleeding can cause symptoms similar to those of dementia 
Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain tumor 
It can result in walking problems, loss of bladder control and memory loss 
Risk factors Many factors can eventually contribute to dementia 
The risk of dementia rises as you age, especially after age 
Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition 
By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early onset Alzheimer s disease 
They ate a diet that included fish, fruits, vegetables and oils 
They also exercised, had cognitive training and participated in social activities 
Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes 
Having diabetes can increase the risk of dementia, especially if it s poorly controlled 
Smoking might increase the risk of developing dementia and blood vessel disease 
Although not yet well understood, late life depression might indicate the development of dementia 
People who ve had a severe head trauma have a greater risk of Alzheimer s disease 
The risk increases in people with more severe and multiple TBIs 
Complications Dementia can affect many body systems and, therefore, the ability to function 
Many people with dementia eventually reduce or stop eating, affecting their nutrient intake 
And food or liquids can enter the lungs, known as aspiration 
They need help using the toilet and taking medicines as directed 
Some day to day situations can present safety issues for people with dementia 
More research is needed, but it might be beneficial to do the following 
Mentally stimulating activities might delay the onset of dementia and decrease its effects 
Physical activity and social interaction might delay the onset of dementia and reduce its symptoms 
You can increase your vitamin D levels with certain foods, supplements and sun exposure 
But it s a good idea to make sure you get adequate vitamin D 
Taking a daily B complex vitamin and vitamin C also might help 
High blood pressure might lead to a higher risk of some types of dementia 
This type of diet also improves cardiovascular health, which also may help lower dementia risk 
These areas of the brain are associated with personality, behavior and language 
In frontotemporal dementia, parts of these lobes shrink, known as atrophy 
Symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected 
Some people with frontotemporal dementia have changes in their personalities 
They become socially inappropriate and may be impulsive or emotionally indifferent 
Frontotemporal dementia can be misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or as Alzheimer s disease 
But FTD tends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimer s disease 
FTD is the cause of dementia about to of the time 
SymptomsSymptoms of frontotemporal dementia differ from one person to the next 
People with frontotemporal dementia tend to have clusters of symptom types that occur together 
They also may have more than one cluster of symptom types 
Behavioral changesThe most common symptoms of frontotemporal dementia involve extreme changes in behavior and personality 
Compulsive behaviors such as tapping, clapping, or smacking lips over and over 
People with FTD typically overeat or prefer to eat sweets and carbohydrates 
Having hesitant speech that may sound telegraphic by using simple, two word sentences 
But more than half of the people with FTD have no family history of dementia 
More research is being done to understand the connection between the conditions 
Overview Lewy body dementia is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer s disease 
Protein deposits called Lewy bodies develop in nerve cells in the brain 
The protein deposits affect brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement 
This condition is also known as dementia with Lewy bodies 
Lewy body dementia causes a decline in mental abilities that gradually gets worse over time 
People with Lewy body dementia might see things that aren t there 
People with Lewy body dementia might experience Parkinson s disease symptoms 
These symptoms may include rigid muscles, slow movement, trouble walking and tremors 
People with Lewy body dementia might see shapes, animals or people that aren t there 
Signs of Parkinson s disease, known as parkinsonian signs, may occur 
These symptoms include slowed movement, rigid muscles, tremor or a shuffling walk 
People with Lewy body dementia might have thinking problems similar to those of Alzheimer s disease 
They may include confusion, poor attention, visual spatial problems and memory loss 
People with Lewy body dementia can have rapid eye movement REM sleep behavior disorder 
This disorder causes people to physically act out their dreams while asleep 
People with REM sleep behavior disorder may punch, kick, yell or scream while sleeping 
As symptoms get worse, Lewy body dementia can lead to 
Death, on average about to years after symptoms start 
Whether a stroke affects your thinking and reasoning depends on your stroke s severity and location 
Controlling these factors may help lower your chances of developing vascular dementia 
Symptoms often overlap with those of other types of dementia, especially Alzheimer s disease dementia 
Sudden or frequent urge to urinate or inability to control passing urine 
Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke 
Sometimes a characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms follows a series of strokes or ministrokes 
But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer s disease dementia 
What s more, vascular disease and Alzheimer s disease often occur together 
One type of vascular dementia involving many strokes is called multi infarct dementia 
Your risk of vascular dementia rises as you grow older 
The disorder is rare before age , and the risk rises substantially by your s 
This increases the risk of vascular problems in the brain 
Damage in brain blood vessels can increase your risk of stroke and vascular dementia 
PreventionThe health of your brain s blood vessels is closely linked to your overall heart health 
Regular physical activity should be a key part of everyone s wellness plan 
In addition to all of its other benefits, exercise may help you avoid vascular dementia 
Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu like symptoms 
Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year 
SymptomsMany people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection 
This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome 
Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky 
And the number of clot forming cells platelets in your bloodstream drops 
This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death 
When to see a doctorSevere dengue fever is a life threatening medical emergency 
Causes Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses 
You can t get dengue fever from being around an infected person 
Especially high risk areas include Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa 
Complications Severe dengue fever can cause internal bleeding and organ damage 
In some cases, severe dengue fever can lead to death 
The vaccine is given in three doses over the course of months 
When you go into mosquito infested areas, wear a long sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and shoes 
Permethrin can be applied to your clothing, shoes, camping gear and bed netting 
You can also buy clothing made with permethrin already in it 
For your skin, use a repellent containing at least a concentration of DEET 
You can help lower mosquito populations by eliminating habitats where they lay their eggs 
Many people have a passing experience of depersonalization or derealization at some point 
The main treatment for depersonalization derealization disorder is psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy 
The experience and feelings of the condition can be hard to describe 
Symptoms usually begin in the middle or late teenage years, or in early adulthood 
For example, you may feel like you re floating in the air above yourself 
You also could feel that your head is wrapped in cotton 
Emotional or physical numbness of your senses or responses to the world around you 
Surroundings that appear out of their usual shape, or are blurry or colorless 
Unrealistic thoughts about distance and the size and shape of objects 
Bouts of depersonalization derealization disorder may last hours, days, weeks or months 
See a doctor if you have feelings of depersonalization or derealization that 
Get in the way of work, relationships or daily activities 
Causes The cause of depersonalization derealization disorder is not well understood 
Some people may be more likely to experience depersonalization and derealization than others 
Risk factors Factors that may raise the risk of depersonalization derealization disorder include 
Serious stress, such as major relationship, financial or work related issues 
Drug misuse, which can cause bouts of depersonalization or derealization 
Complications Bouts of depersonalization or derealization can be scary and make it hard to function 
Make it hard to focus on tasks or remember things 
Get in the way of work and other routine activities 
But it can also result in something you might not expect depression 
Sometimes it s called peripartum depression because it can start during pregnancy and continue after childbirth 
Rarely, an extreme mood disorder called postpartum psychosis also may develop after childbirth 
Postpartum depression is not a character flaw or a weakness 
SymptomsSymptoms of depression after childbirth vary, and they can range from mild to severe 
Symptoms usually develop within the first few weeks after giving birth 
Less interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy 
Untreated, postpartum depression may last for many months or longer 
Postpartum psychosis may lead to life threatening thoughts or behaviors and requires immediate treatment 
Postpartum depression in the other parentStudies show that new fathers can experience postpartum depression, too 
These are the same symptoms that mothers with postpartum depression experience 
If you have symptoms that suggest you may have postpartum psychosis, get help immediately 
Make it hard for you to care for your baby 
Call or your local emergency assistance number to get help 
They may not be aware of signs and symptoms of depression 
When you re sleep deprived and overwhelmed, you may have trouble handling even minor problems 
You may be anxious about your ability to care for a newborn 
You have a history of depression, either during pregnancy or at other times 
You have family members who ve had depression or other mood disorders 
You re having problems in your relationship with your spouse or partner 
Complications Left untreated, postpartum depression can interfere with mother child bonding and cause family problems 
Untreated postpartum depression can last for months or longer, sometimes becoming an ongoing depressive disorder 
Even when treated, postpartum depression increases a woman s risk of future episodes of major depression 
During pregnancy, your provider can monitor you closely for symptoms of depression 
You may complete a depression screening questionnaire during your pregnancy and after delivery 
Sometimes mild depression can be managed with support groups, counseling or other therapies 
In other cases, antidepressants may be recommended even during pregnancy 
For most teens, depression symptoms ease with treatment such as medication and psychological counseling 
Feelings of sadness, which can include crying spells for no apparent reason 
Loss of interest in, or conflict with, family and friends 
Extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure, and the need for excessive reassurance 
Ongoing sense that life and the future are grim and bleak 
Agitation or restlessness for example, pacing, hand wringing or an inability to sit still 
Angry outbursts, disruptive or risky behavior, or other acting out behaviors 
Your teen s family doctor or pediatrician is a good place to start 
Talk to a health care provider such as your doctor or school nurse 
Or contact a crisis service for teenagers in the U S called TXT HELP 
Seek help from your primary care doctor or other health care provider 
Risk factors Many factors increase the risk of developing or triggering teen depression, including 
Having been the victim or witness of violence, such as physical or sexual abuse 
Having ongoing pain or a chronic physical illness such as cancer, diabetes or asthma 
Having certain personality traits, such as low self esteem or being overly dependent, self critical or pessimistic 
Being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender in an unsupportive environment 
Complications related to teen depression may include, for example 
Reach out for friendship and social support, especially in times of crisis 
Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening 
Overview Dermatitis is a common condition that causes swelling and irritation of the skin 
It has many causes and forms and often involves itchy, dry skin or a rash 
Or it might cause the skin to blister, ooze, crust or flake 
Three common types of this condition are atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis 
SymptomsEach type of dermatitis tends to occur on a different part of the body 
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on skin color 
Small, raised bumps, more typical on brown or Black skin 
You re so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities 
You have a skin infection look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs 
Seek immediate medical attention if you have a fever and the rash looks infected 
Examples of such things are poison ivy, perfume, lotion and jewelry containing nickel 
Being a health care worker is linked to hand eczema 
Complications Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks 
These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and fungi 
These skin infections can spread and become life threatening, though this is rare 
It might take months or years for the skin to return to its usual color 
PreventionWear protective clothing if you re doing a task that involves irritants or caustic chemicals 
Developing a basic skin care routine also may help prevent dermatitis 
The following habits can help reduce the drying effects of bathing 
Choose a cleanser that has no dyes, alcohols and fragrance 
While the skin is still damp, seal in moisture with an oil, cream or lotion 
Try different products to find one that works for you 
Overview Neurodermatitis is a skin condition that starts with an itchy patch of skin 
Neurodermatitis also known as lichen simplex chronicus is not life threatening or contagious 
Breaking the itch scratch cycle of neurodermatitis is challenging, and neurodermatitis is usually a long term condition 
Raised, rough patches that are inflamed or darker than the rest of the skin 
The itchiness, which can be intense, may come and go or be nonstop 
You may scratch your skin out of habit and while sleeping 
You catch yourself repeatedly scratching the same patch of skin 
The itch prevents you from sleeping or focusing on your daily routines 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of neurodermatitis include 
The condition is most common among people between and years of age 
The itch of neurodermatitis can affect your sleep, sexual function and quality of life 
Overview Seborrheic seb o REE ik dermatitis is a common skin condition that mainly affects your scalp 
Seborrheic dermatitis is also called dandruff, seborrheic eczema and seborrheic psoriasis 
Flaking skin dandruff on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache 
Ring shaped annular rash, for a type called petaloid seborrheic dermatitis 
You re so uncomfortable that you re losing sleep or are distracted from your daily routines 
Risk factors Risk factors for seborrheic dermatitis include 
Recovery from stressful medical conditions, such as a heart attack 
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberansDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans DFSP is a rare type of skin cancer 
It starts in connective tissue cells in the middle layer of the skin dermis 
As it grows, lumps of tissue protuberans may form near the surface of the skin 
This skin cancer often forms on the arms, legs and trunk 
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans grows slowly and rarely spreads beyond the skin 
Your health care provider will inspect your skin to look for signs of skin cancer 
Your provider may remove a small amount of tissue for testing 
Tests in the lab can see if cancer cells are present 
TreatmentDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans treatment typically involves surgery to remove the cancer 
Other treatments may be used to kill cancer cells that might remain after surgery 
This makes it more likely that all the cancer cells are removed 
After each layer of skin is removed, it s examined for signs of cancer 
The process keeps going until there are no signs of cancer 
Your provider may recommend radiation therapy if all the cancer couldn t be removed during surgery 
Some people with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans have cancer cells that produce an excess protein 
A drug called imatinib Gleevec can target those cells and cause them to die 
Ask your provider whether you re eligible to participate in a clinical trial 
These marks tend to go away in less than minutes 
The condition is also known as dermatographism and skin writing 
The symptoms may occur within a few minutes of the skin being rubbed or scratched 
Rarely, the skin symptoms develop more slowly and lasts several hours to days 
When to see a doctorSee your health care provider if your symptoms bother you 
It may be an allergic reaction, though no specific allergen has been found 
For example, rubbing from your clothes or bedsheets may irritate your skin 
It tends to be more common in teens and young adults 
If you have other skin conditions, you may be at greater risk 
PreventionTry these tips to reduce discomfort and prevent the symptoms of dermatographia 
Use a mild soap or nonsoap cleanser and pat skin dry 
Use warm water when you take a bath or shower 
Creams and ointments are thicker and tend to work better than lotions do 
Apply your skin product while your skin is still damp from washing 
In adults, dermatomyositis usually occurs in the late s to early s 
In children, it most often appears between and years of age 
There s no cure for dermatomyositis, but periods of symptom improvement can occur 
Treatment can help clear the skin rash and help you regain muscle strength and function 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms of dermatomyositis can appear suddenly or develop gradually over time 
The rash, which can be itchy and painful, is often the first sign of dermatomyositis 
Environmental factors could include viral infections, sun exposure, certain medications and smoking 
These can occur in your muscles, skin and connective tissues as the disease progresses 
Overview Desmoid tumors are noncancerous growths that occur in the connective tissue 
Desmoid tumors most often occur in the abdomen, arms and legs 
Some desmoid tumors are slow growing and don t require immediate treatment 
Others grow quickly and are treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or other drugs 
Desmoid tumors aren t considered cancers because they don t spread to other areas of the body 
For this reason, people with desmoid tumors are often cared for by cancer doctors 
SymptomsDesmoid tumor symptoms differ based on where the tumors occur 
Desmoid tumors most often happen in the abdomen, arms and legs 
Cramping and nausea, when desmoid tumors occur in the abdomen 
Doctors know these tumors form when a connective tissue cell develops changes in its DNA 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of desmoid tumors include 
Desmoid tumors tend to occur in younger adults in their s and s 
People with familial adenomatous polyposis FAP have an increased risk of desmoid tumors 
Rarely, a desmoid tumor may develop during or soon after pregnancy 
Sometimes this type of cancer can occur in other parts of the body 
Desmoplastic small round cell tumors are rare cancers that begin as a growth of cells 
The cancer cells can quickly spread to other nearby organs 
Treatment for desmoplastic small round cell tumors typically involves a combination of treatments 
Desmoplastic small round cell tumors are a type of soft tissue sarcoma 
SymptomsDesmoplastic small round cell tumor symptoms vary depending on where the cancer begins 
Signs and symptoms of desmoplastic small round cell tumors in the abdomen include 
Causes It s not clear what causes desmoplastic small round cell tumors 
Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes in its DNA 
This creates a clump of cancer cells called a tumor 
Contacting an eye specialist ophthalmologist right away can help save your vision 
But warning signs almost always appear before it occurs or has advanced, such as 
Retinal detachment is a medical emergency in which you can permanently lose your vision 
This fluid builds up and causes the retina to pull away from underlying tissues 
Tractional detachment is typically seen in people who have poorly controlled diabetes or other conditions 
Risk factors The following factors increase your risk of retinal detachment 
Aging retinal detachment is more common in people over age 
Treatment of nasal obstruction may include medications to reduce the swelling 
Some septal deformities, however, may cause the following signs and symptoms 
This blockage can make it difficult to breathe through the nostril or nostrils 
The surface of your nasal septum may become dry, increasing your risk of nosebleeds 
There is some debate about the possible nasal causes of facial pain 
Being aware of the nasal cycle isn t typical and can indicate nasal obstruction 
When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you experience 
A blocked nostril or nostrils that doesn t respond to treatment 
The aging process may affect nasal structures, worsening a deviated septum over time 
Not wearing your seat belt while riding in a motorized vehicle 
Complications A severely deviated septum causing nasal blockage can lead to 
A feeling of pressure or congestion in your nasal passages 
Wear a seat belt when riding in a motorized vehicle 
NMO is also called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder NMOSD and Devic disease 
It occurs when the body s immune system reacts against its own cells 
Irregular antibodies bind to proteins in the central nervous system and cause damage 
Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems 
Chronic diabetes conditions include type diabetes and type diabetes 
Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal 
But the blood sugar levels aren t high enough to be called diabetes 
And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it 
But it may go away after the baby is born 
SymptomsDiabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is 
In type diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe 
Some of the symptoms of type diabetes and type diabetes are 
Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections 
Type diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age 
Type diabetes is more common in people older than 
If you think you or your child may have diabetes 
If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your health care provider 
The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin 
Causes To understand diabetes, it s important to understand how the body normally uses glucose 
As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas 
Glucose comes from two major sources food and the liver 
Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin 
The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown 
Risk factors Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes 
Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type diabetes 
If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type diabetes 
Race or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type diabetes 
If you have diabetes, you re more likely to have heart disease or stroke 
Diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections 
Type diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer s disease 
Depression symptoms are common in people with type and type diabetes 
Complications of gestational diabetesMost women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies 
However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby 
Complications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes, including 
Extra glucose triggers the baby s pancreas to make extra insulin 
It can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a C section 
Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar hypoglycemia shortly after birth 
Untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a baby s death either before or shortly after birth 
Complications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes, including 
Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber 
Or aim to get at least minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week 
That prompts the body to make large amounts of urine 
It also causes a feeling of being very thirsty even after having something to drink 
Diabetes insipidus also is called arginine vasopressin deficiency and arginine vasopressin resistance 
It s a common condition, and it s often called simply diabetes 
That includes relieving thirst, lowering the amount of urine the body makes and preventing dehydration 
Being very thirsty, often with a preference for cold water 
Getting up to urinate and drink water often during the night 
A baby or young child who has diabetes insipidus may have these symptoms 
Large amounts of pale urine that result in heavy, wet diapers 
Being very thirsty, with a preference for drinking water and cold liquids 
Fluid in the blood is filtered through the kidneys to remove waste 
Afterward, most of that fluid is returned to the bloodstream 
The waste and a small amount of fluid leave the kidneys as urine 
Urine leaves the body after it s temporarily stored in the bladder 
ADH is made in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus 
In diabetes insipidus, the body can t properly balance fluid levels 
The cause of the fluid imbalance depends on the type of diabetes insipidus 
That damage affects the production, storage and release of ADH 
Certain medicines, including lithium and antiviral medicines such as foscarnet Foscavir 
This rare form of diabetes insipidus only happens during pregnancy 
It develops when an enzyme made by the placenta destroys ADH in a pregnant person 
People who have this disorder constantly feel thirsty and drink lots of fluids 
It can be caused by damage to the thirst regulating mechanism in the hypothalamus 
It also has been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia 
Sometimes no clear cause of diabetes insipidus can be found 
In that case, repeat testing over time often is useful 
Testing may be able to identify an underlying cause eventually 
Take certain medicines, such as diuretics, that could lead to kidney problems 
Have high levels of calcium or low levels of potassium in their blood 
Gestational diabetes Overview Gestational diabetes is diabetes diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy gestation 
Like other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes affects how your cells use sugar glucose 
Gestational diabetes causes high blood sugar that can affect your pregnancy and your baby s health 
Controlling blood sugar can keep you and your baby healthy and prevent a difficult delivery 
You ll need to be tested for changes in blood sugar more often 
SymptomsMost of the time, gestational diabetes doesn t cause noticeable signs or symptoms 
If you develop gestational diabetes, you may need checkups more often 
Causes Researchers don t yet know why some women get gestational diabetes and others don t 
Usually, various hormones work to keep blood sugar levels in check 
Risk factors Risk factors for gestational diabetes include 
Having previously delivered a baby weighing more than pounds kilograms 
Complications Gestational diabetes that s not carefully managed can lead to high blood sugar levels 
Or early delivery may be recommended because the baby is large 
Babies born early may experience respiratory distress syndrome a condition that makes breathing difficult 
Sometimes babies have low blood sugar hypoglycemia shortly after birth 
Severe episodes of hypoglycemia may cause seizures in the baby 
Babies have a higher risk of developing obesity and type diabetes later in life 
Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby s death either before or shortly after birth 
Complications that may affect youGestational diabetes may also increase your risk of 
You re more likely to have a C section if you have gestational diabetes 
You also have a higher risk of developing type diabetes as you get older 
Choose foods high in fiber and low in fat and calories 
Strive for variety to help you achieve your goals without compromising taste or nutrition 
Exercising before and during pregnancy can help protect you from developing gestational diabetes 
Aim for minutes of moderate activity on most days of the week 
But gaining too much weight too quickly can increase your risk of gestational diabetes 
Ask your health care provider what a reasonable amount of weight gain is for you 
In this condition, the pancreas makes little or no insulin 
Different factors, such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type diabetes 
Although type diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults 
Even after a lot of research, type diabetes has no cure 
SymptomsType diabetes symptoms can appear suddenly and may include 
Bed wetting in children who have never wet the bed during the night 
Causes The exact cause of type diabetes is unknown 
Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach pancreas 
Insulin travels through the body, allowing sugar to enter the cells 
As the blood sugar level drops, the pancreas puts less insulin into the bloodstream 
In type diabetes, there s no insulin to let glucose into the cells 
Risk factors Some factors that can raise your risk for type diabetes include 
Having certain genes increases the risk of developing type diabetes 
Type diabetes can appear at any age, but it appears at two noticeable peaks 
The first peak occurs in children between and years old 
The second is in children between and years old 
Complications Over time, type diabetes complications can affect major organs in the body 
These organs include the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys 
Having a normal blood sugar level can lower the risk of many complications 
Diabetes complications can lead to disabilities or even threaten your life 
Diabetes increases the risk of some problems with the heart and blood vessels 
This usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and spreads upward 
The kidneys have millions of tiny blood vessels that keep waste from entering the blood 
Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or end stage kidney disease that can t be reversed 
Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma 
These infections may need to be treated with toe, foot or leg removal amputation 
Diabetes may leave you more prone to infections of the skin and mouth 
High blood sugar levels can be dangerous for both the parent and the baby 
The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects increases when diabetes isn t well controlled 
Ask your provider if you might be eligible for one of these clinical trials 
Type diabetes in children used to be known as juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes 
The diagnosis of type diabetes in children can be overwhelming, especially in the beginning 
There s no cure for type diabetes in children, but it can be managed 
Genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role in this process 
Without enough insulin, sugar builds up in your child s bloodstream 
Risk factors for type diabetes in children include 
Certain genes indicate an increased risk of type diabetes 
Exposure to various viruses may trigger the autoimmune destruction of the islet cells 
Complications Type diabetes can affect the major organs in your body 
Nerve damage usually happens gradually over a long period of time 
Diabetes may decrease bone mineral density, increasing your child s risk of osteoporosis as an adult 
Working with your child to maintain good blood sugar control as much as possible 
Scheduling regular visits with your child s diabetes health care professional 
Your child s health care provider may recommend tests for these conditions 
Preventing further destruction of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed 
This long term condition results in too much sugar circulating in the blood 
And cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar 
Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease 
Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck 
Causes Type diabetes is mainly the result of two problems 
The pancreas can t make enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels within a healthy range 
Insulin controls how the body uses sugar in the following ways 
Sugar in the bloodstream triggers the pancreas to release insulin 
Insulin circulates in the bloodstream, enabling sugar to enter the cells 
In response to this drop, the pancreas releases less insulin 
Glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin 
Instead of moving into the cells, sugar builds up in the blood 
As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas releases more insulin 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of type diabetes include 
The less active a person is, the greater the risk 
The risk of type diabetes increases with age, especially after age 
Also, factors that increase the risk of diabetes are risk factors for other serious diseases 
High blood sugar over time can damage or destroy nerves 
Damage to nerves of the heart can contribute to irregular heart rhythms 
Nerve damage in the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation 
Diabetes may lead to chronic kidney disease or end stage kidney disease that can t be reversed 
Diabetes may raise the risk of some skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections 
Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections, which may heal poorly 
Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people living with type diabetes 
Obesity may be the main contributing factor to both conditions 
Sitting still for long periods of time can increase the risk of type diabetes 
SymptomsType diabetes in children may develop so gradually that there are no noticeable symptoms 
Darkened areas of skin, most often around the neck or in the armpits and groin 
Causes The exact cause of type diabetes is unknown 
But family history and genetics appear to play an important role 
What is clear is that children with type diabetes can t process sugar glucose properly 
Most of the sugar in the body comes from food 
Insulin is produced by a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas 
The pancreas sends insulin to the blood when food is eaten 
When your child has type diabetes, this process doesn t work as well 
As a result, instead of fueling cells, sugar builds up in your child s bloodstream 
The cells become resistant to insulin and don t allow as much sugar in 
However, it s clear that certain factors increase the risk, including 
Being overweight is a strong risk factor for type diabetes in children 
The less active children are, the greater their risk of type diabetes 
Adolescent girls are more likely to develop type diabetes than are adolescent boys 
Type diabetes in children is often associated with metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovarian syndrome 
A combination of the following conditions is often called metabolic syndrome 
Polycystic ovary syndromePolycystic ovary syndrome PCOS affects young females after puberty 
The long term complications of type diabetes develop gradually over many years 
Complications of type diabetes are related to high blood sugar and include 
Teaching your child the importance of healthy eating and participating in regular physical activity 
PreventionHealthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type diabetes in children 
Sign up your child for a sports team or dance lessons 
Diabetic coma Overview A diabetic coma is a life threatening disorder that causes unconsciousness 
If it s not treated, a diabetic coma can result in death 
One of the most important is to follow your diabetes treatment plan 
SymptomsSymptoms of high blood sugar or low blood sugar usually develop before a diabetic coma 
High blood sugar hyperglycemia If your blood sugar level is too high, you may have 
Low blood sugar hypoglycemia If your blood sugar is too low, you may have 
That means they don t have warning symptoms that signal a drop in blood sugar 
When to see a doctorA diabetic coma is a medical emergency 
If you re with someone with diabetes who has passed out, call for emergency help 
Tell the emergency personnel that the unconscious person has diabetes 
If it s not treated, it can lead to a diabetic coma 
Diabetic ketoacidosis is most common in people who have type diabetes 
But it can also occur in people who have type diabetes or gestational diabetes 
That triggers a process that draws a large amount of fluid from the body 
If it isn t treated, this can lead to life threatening dehydration and a diabetic coma 
In severe cases, low blood sugar hypoglycemia may cause you to pass out 
Low blood sugar can be caused by too much insulin or not enough food 
Exercising too vigorously or drinking too much alcohol can have the same effect 
If you re using an insulin pump, you have to check your blood sugar frequently 
This can increase your risk of a diabetic coma caused by hypoglycemia 
PreventionGood day to day control of your diabetes can help you prevent a diabetic coma 
Consistent snacks and meals can help you control your blood sugar level 
It also can alert you to dangerous highs or lows 
You may need to have the dose or the timing of your medication adjusted 
If you are sick and unable to eat, your blood sugar may drop 
If you have a large amount of ketones, call your health care provider for advice 
High levels of ketones can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can lead to coma 
If you pass out, someone should be able to call for emergency help 
SymptomsEarly warning signs and symptomsInitial signs and symptoms of diabetic hypoglycemia include 
Symptoms can differ from person to person or from episode to episode 
It s also possible you won t have any symptoms of hypoglycemia 
Make sure your family, friends and co workers know what to do in an emergency 
Increasing exercise or physical activity without eating more or adjusting your medications 
Blood sugar regulationMost of the body s glucose comes from food 
The hormone insulin lowers blood sugar glucose levels when blood sugar is too high 
Maintaining the balance between insulin, food and activity isn t always easy 
Risk factors Some people have a greater risk of diabetic hypoglycemia, including 
People who don t feel low blood sugar symptoms hypoglycemia unawareness 
Anyone with a disability that prevents a quick response to falling blood sugar levels 
Complications If you ignore the symptoms of hypoglycemia too long, you may lose consciousness 
Recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia early, because if untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to 
Diabetic hypoglycemia can increase the risk of serious even deadly accidents 
Take your medication as recommended by your health care provider 
Adjust your medication or eat additional snacks if you increase your physical activity 
Eat a meal or snack with alcohol, if you choose to drink 
Alcohol may also cause delayed hypoglycemia hours later, making blood sugar monitoring even more important 
Use a medical identification necklace or bracelet and wallet card 
Diabetic ketoacidosis Overview Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes 
The condition develops when the body can t produce enough insulin 
Without enough insulin, the body begins to break down fat as fuel 
This causes a buildup of acids in the bloodstream called ketones 
If it s left untreated, the buildup can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis 
SymptomsDiabetic ketoacidosis symptoms often come on quickly, sometimes within hours 
For some, these symptoms may be the first sign of having diabetes 
You might also try a urine ketone test kit you can get at a drugstore 
You re throwing up and can t keep down food or liquid 
You have ketones in your urine and can t reach your health care provider for advice 
Without enough insulin, the body can t use sugar to make the energy it needs 
Ketones build up in the blood and eventually spill over into the urine 
These hormones work against the effects of insulin and sometimes cause diabetic ketoacidosis 
Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common illnesses that can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis 
Missed insulin treatments can leave too little insulin in the body 
In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis may be the first sign of having diabetes 
Perhaps surprisingly, the most common complications of diabetic ketoacidosis are related to this lifesaving treatment 
A low potassium level can affect the heart, muscles and nerves 
Adjusting the blood sugar level too quickly can cause the brain to swell 
This appears to be more common in children, especially those with newly diagnosed diabetes 
Untreated, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to loss of consciousness and, eventually, death 
PreventionThere are many ways to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis and other diabetes complications 
If you have low levels of ketones, you may need to take more insulin 
But don t let fear keep you from taking good care of yourself 
Ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it 
Overview Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of type diabetes and type diabetes 
In the United States, about in people living with diabetes have diabetic nephropathy 
Over years, diabetic nephropathy slowly damages the kidneys filtering system 
Early treatment may prevent this condition or slow it and lower the chance of complications 
Treatment options for kidney failure are dialysis or a kidney transplant 
SymptomsIn the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, there might not be symptoms 
Causes Diabetic nephropathy happens when diabetes damages blood vessels and other cells in the kidneys 
How the kidneys workThe kidneys have millions of tiny blood vessel clusters called glomeruli 
Damage to these blood vessels can lead to diabetic nephropathy 
Diabetic nephropathy causesDiabetic nephropathy is a common complication of type and type diabetes 
This can lead to kidney damage and cause high blood pressure 
Complications Complications of diabetic nephropathy can come on slowly over months or years 
A rise in the levels of the mineral potassium in the blood, called hyperkalemia 
Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the pregnant person and the growing fetus 
Take medicines you get without a prescription only as directed 
For people with diabetic nephropathy, these types of pain relievers can lead to kidney damage 
Cigarette smoking can damage kidneys or make kidney damage worse 
High blood sugar glucose can injure nerves throughout the body 
Diabetic neuropathy most often damages nerves in the legs and feet 
It can also cause problems with the digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels and heart 
But for others, diabetic neuropathy can be quite painful and disabling 
You can have one type or more than one type of neuropathy 
Your symptoms depend on the type you have and which nerves are affected 
You may not notice anything is wrong until considerable nerve damage has occurred 
Peripheral neuropathyThis type of neuropathy may also be called distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy 
It affects the feet and legs first, followed by the hands and arms 
Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are often worse at night, and may include 
Numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes 
Extreme sensitivity to touch for some people, even a bedsheet s weight can be painful 
Serious foot problems, such as ulcers, infections, and bone and joint damage 
Diabetes can affect nerves in any of these areas, possibly causing signs and symptoms including 
A lack of awareness that blood sugar levels are low hypoglycemia unawareness 
Slow stomach emptying gastroparesis , causing nausea, vomiting, sensation of fullness and loss of appetite 
Changes in the way the eyes adjust from light to dark or far to near 
Problems with sexual response, such as vaginal dryness in women and erectile dysfunction in men 
Mononeuropathy focal neuropathy Mononeuropathy refers to damage to a single, specific nerve 
The nerve may be in the face, torso, arm or leg 
Weakness in the hand that may result in dropping things 
Weakness causing difficulty lifting the front part of the foot foot drop 
When to see a doctorCall your health care provider for an appointment if you have 
A cut or sore on your foot that is infected or won t heal 
Causes The exact cause of each type of neuropathy is unknown 
Risk factors Anyone who has diabetes can develop neuropathy 
Uncontrolled blood sugar increases the risk of every diabetes complication, including nerve damage 
Kidney damage sends toxins into the blood, which can lead to nerve damage 
Smoking narrows and hardens the arteries, reducing blood flow to the legs and feet 
This makes it more difficult for wounds to heal and damages the peripheral nerves 
Complications Diabetic neuropathy can cause a number of serious complications, including 
But people who have autonomic neuropathy may not experience these warning signs 
In severe cases, an infection can spread to the bone or lead to tissue death 
Removal amputation of a toe, foot or even part of the leg may be necessary 
Bacteria can build up in the bladder and kidneys, causing urinary tract infections 
If nerve damage occurs in the digestive tract, constipation or diarrhea, or both are possible 
Autonomic neuropathy often damages the nerves that affect the sex organs 
Follow your health care provider s recommendations for good foot care 
Look for blisters, cuts, bruises, cracked and peeling skin, redness, and swelling 
Wash your feet every day with lukewarm water and mild soap 
But don t get lotion between your toes because it might encourage fungal growth 
File the edges carefully so that you have smooth edges 
If you can t do this yourself, a specialist in foot problems podiatrist can help 
Make sure your shoes fit properly and allow your toes to move 
Diabetic retinopathy Overview Diabetic retinopathy die uh BET ik ret ih NOP uh thee is a diabetes complication that affects eyes 
The condition can develop in anyone who has type or type diabetes 
SymptomsYou might not have symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy 
If you re pregnant, your eye doctor might recommend additional eye exams throughout your pregnancy 
As a result, the eye attempts to grow new blood vessels 
But these new blood vessels don t develop properly and can leak easily 
Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter as well 
NPDR can progress from mild to severe as more blood vessels become blocked 
If macular edema decreases vision, treatment is required to prevent permanent vision loss 
Diabetic retinopathy can progress to this more severe type, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
Risk factors Anyone who has diabetes can develop diabetic retinopathy 
The risk of developing the eye condition can increase as a result of 
Complications Diabetic retinopathy involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina 
In more severe cases, blood can fill the vitreous cavity and completely block your vision 
Vitreous hemorrhage by itself usually doesn t cause permanent vision loss 
The blood often clears from the eye within a few weeks or months 
Unless your retina is damaged, your vision will likely return to its previous clarity 
This can cause spots floating in your vision, flashes of light or severe vision loss 
If you have diabetes, reduce your risk of getting diabetic retinopathy by doing the following 
Ask your doctor how often you need to test your blood sugar 
For most people with diabetes, the A C goal is to be under 
Eating healthy foods, exercising regularly and losing excess weight can help 
Smoking increases your risk of various diabetes complications, including diabetic retinopathy 
Taking an active role in diabetes management can go a long way toward preventing complications 
It can be caused by wet or soiled diapers that aren t changed often enough 
Or it may be due to skin sensitivity and chafing 
Inflamed skin in the diaper area buttocks, thighs and genitals 
Take your child to a doctor or other health care professional for 
A rash that persists or gets worse despite home care 
A rash that causes burning or pain when your baby passes urine or stool 
Skin can develop a rash if wet or soiled diapers are left on too long 
Babies may be more prone to diaper rash if they re having many stools or diarrhea 
Tightfitting diapers or clothing that rubs against the skin can lead to a rash 
Ingredients in lotions, powders and oils might add to the problem 
What begins as a simple infection may spread to the surrounding skin 
These rashes can be found within the creases of the skin 
As babies start to eat solid foods, the content of their stool changes 
Breastfed babies might develop diaper rash in response to something the mother has eaten 
Antibiotics can contribute to a rash by killing bacteria that keep yeast growth in check 
Breastfed babies whose mothers take antibiotics also are at increased risk of diaper rash 
Mild skin lightening often clears up in a few weeks 
Skin affected more severely could take months or years to return to its usual color 
Diaper rash can develop into a severe infection that doesn t respond to treatment 
Remove wet or dirty diapers as soon as you can 
If your child is in child care, ask staff members to do the same 
Rinse your baby s bottom with warm water as part of each diaper change 
You can use a sink, tub or water bottle for this purpose 
Moist washcloths, cotton balls or baby wipes can aid in cleaning the skin 
Some baby wipes can be irritating, so use wipes that don t contain alcohol or fragrance 
Or use plain water or water with a mild soap or cleanser 
Gently pat the skin dry with a clean towel or let it air dry 
Petroleum jelly and zinc oxide are the time proven ingredients in many diaper rash products 
Diapers that are too tight can rub against the skin 
Exposing skin to air is a natural and gentle way to let it dry 
Overview Diarrhea loose, watery and possibly more frequent bowel movements is a common problem 
Luckily, diarrhea is usually short lived, lasting no more than a few days 
When to see a doctorIf you re an adult, see your doctor if 
In children, particularly young children, diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration 
Causes A number of diseases and conditions can cause diarrhea, including 
Antibiotics get rid of infections by killing bad bacteria, but they also kill good bacteria 
Other drugs that cause diarrhea are anti cancer drugs and antacids with magnesium 
Lactose is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products 
People who have trouble digesting lactose have diarrhea after eating dairy products 
Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits and honey 
Fructose can lead to diarrhea in people who have trouble digesting it 
Partial intestine or gallbladder removal surgeries can sometimes cause diarrhea 
Complications Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which can be life threatening if untreated 
Dehydration is particularly dangerous in children, older adults and those with weakened immune systems 
If you have signs of serious dehydration, seek medical help 
Not having a wet diaper in three or more hours 
PreventionPreventing infectious diarrheaWash your hands to prevent the spread of infectious diarrhea 
After putting soap on your hands, rub your hands together for at least seconds 
This is about as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice through 
Use an alcohol based hand sanitizer when you can t get to a sink 
Don t eat raw fruits and vegetables unless you can peel them yourself 
Drink bottled water, soda, beer or wine served in its original container 
Beverages made with boiled water, such as coffee and tea, are probably safe 
Remember that alcohol and caffeine can aggravate diarrhea and worsen dehydration 
It s caused by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water 
Fortunately, traveler s diarrhea usually isn t serious in most people it s just unpleasant 
If you do develop traveler s diarrhea, chances are it will go away without treatment 
This way, you ll be prepared in case diarrhea gets severe or won t go away 
SymptomsTraveler s diarrhea may begin suddenly during your trip or shortly after you return home 
However, you can have multiple episodes of traveler s diarrhea during one trip 
Suddenly passing three or more looser watery stools a day 
When to see a doctorTraveler s diarrhea usually goes away on its own within several days 
In such cases, you may need prescription medicines to help you get better 
Call a doctor if your child is sick and has any of the following symptoms 
Decreased volume of urine, including fewer wet diapers in infants 
But usually infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses or parasites are to blame 
You typically develop traveler s diarrhea after ingesting food or water contaminated with organisms from feces 
So why aren t natives of high risk countries affected in the same way 
Often their bodies have become used to the bacteria and have developed immunity to them 
Risk factors Each year millions of international travelers experience traveler s diarrhea 
Your chances of getting traveler s diarrhea are mostly determined by your destination 
But certain groups of people have a greater risk of developing the condition 
The condition is slightly more common in young adult tourists 
Though the reasons why aren t clear, it s possible that young adults lack acquired immunity 
People with diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, or severe kidney, liver or heart disease 
The risk of traveler s diarrhea varies by season in certain parts of the world 
Dehydration is especially dangerous for children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems 
Dehydration caused by diarrhea can cause serious complications, including organ damage, shock or coma 
But it s still possible to get sick even if you follow these rules 
Other tips that may help decrease your risk of getting sick include 
Don t consume unpasteurized milk and dairy products, including ice cream 
Don t eat moist food at room temperature, such as sauces and buffet offerings 
Stay away from salads and from fruits you can t peel, such as grapes and berries 
Don t drink the waterWhen visiting high risk areas, keep the following tips in mind 
Don t drink unsterilized water from tap, well or stream 
If you need to consume local water, boil it for three minutes 
Let the water cool naturally and store it in a clean covered container 
Don t use locally made ice cubes or drink mixed fruit juices made with tap water 
Beware of sliced fruit that may have been washed in contaminated water 
Order hot beverages, such as coffee or tea, and make sure they re steaming hot 
Wipe off any can or bottle before drinking or pouring 
Consider a water filter pump with a microstrainer filter that can filter out small microorganisms 
You also can chemically disinfect water with iodine or chlorine 
Follow additional tipsHere are other ways to reduce your risk of traveler s diarrhea 
Make sure dishes and utensils are clean and dry before using them 
Seek out food items that require little handling in preparation 
Keep children from putting things including their dirty hands in their mouths 
Common harmless side effects of bismuth subsalicylate include a black colored tongue and dark stools 
A voice disorder is a change in how the voice sounds 
Voice changes related to the brain and nervous system, known as spasmodic dysphonia spaz MOD ki dis FOE nee uh 
Polyps, nodules or cysts on the vocal cords growths that aren t cancer 
Risk factors Many factors can lead to a voice disorder, such as 
Conditions related to the brain and nervous system, such as Parkinson s disease or a stroke 
Scarring from neck surgery or from trauma to the front of the neck 
But ongoing dysphagia can be a serious medical condition that needs treatment 
Dysphagia can happen at any age, but it s more common in older adults 
The causes of swallowing problems vary, and treatment depends on the cause 
Feeling as if food is stuck in the throat or chest or behind the breastbone 
If a blockage makes it hard to breathe, call for emergency help immediately 
This condition causes high pressure, poorly coordinated contractions of the esophagus, usually after swallowing 
Esophageal spasm affects the involuntary muscles in the walls of the lower esophagus 
Known as a stricture, a narrowed esophagus can trap large pieces of food 
Tumors or scar tissue, often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD , can cause narrowing 
Difficulty swallowing tends to get progressively worse when esophageal tumors are present 
Sometimes food or another object can partially block the throat or esophagus 
Stomach acid backing up into the esophagus can damage esophageal tissues 
This can lead to spasm or scarring and narrowing of the lower esophagus 
It is caused when white blood cells, called eosinophils, build up in the esophagus 
Scleroderma causes the development of scar like tissue, resulting in stiffening and hardening of tissues 
As a result, acid backs up into the esophagus and causes frequent heartburn 
This cancer treatment can lead to inflammation and scarring of the esophagus 
Certain cancers and some cancer treatments, such as radiation, can cause difficulty swallowing 
Risk factors The following are risk factors for dysphagia 
People with certain neurological or nervous system disorders are more likely to have difficulty swallowing 
Dysphagia can make it difficult to take in enough food and fluids 
However, if you have symptoms of dysphagia, see a healthcare professional 
If you have GERD, see a healthcare professional for treatment 
The term q deletion syndrome covers terms once thought to be different conditions 
The number and severity of symptoms related to q deletion syndrome vary 
But specialists in various fields need to treat almost everyone with this syndrome 
A hard time feeding, failure to gain weight or stomach problems 
Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones 
Illnesses or conditions that are typical of q deletion syndrome may become clear over time 
Your child s healthcare professional may see issues during regularly scheduled well baby visits or annual checkups 
Causes Each person has two copies of chromosome one inherited from each parent 
Many of these genes haven t been clearly identified and aren t well understood 
The region of chromosome that s deleted is known as q 
Or it may occur early when the baby is developing 
This missing portion causes several body systems to develop poorly 
As a result, the condition can cause several errors during fetal development 
 q deletion syndrome often causes heart problems that could lead to too little oxygen rich blood 
Or there may be four problems with heart structure, also known as tetralogy of Fallot 
In children with q deletion syndrome, the thymus gland may be small or missing 
This leads to poor immune function and frequent, severe infections 
Delays in toddler speech development and finding it hard to learn are common 
Some children develop attention deficit hyperactivity condition ADHD or autism spectrum disorder 
Later in life, the risk of depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions is higher 
PreventionIn some cases, an affected parent may pass DiGeorge syndrome to a child 
Or you may want to see a genetic counselor to help plan future pregnancies 
But in advanced stages, diphtheria can damage the heart, kidneys and nervous system 
Even with treatment, diphtheria can be deadly, especially in children 
SymptomsDiphtheria signs and symptoms usually begin to days after a person becomes infected 
Infected people who stay unaware of their illness are known as carriers of diphtheria 
They re called carriers because they can spread the infection without being sick themselves 
Ulcers covered by a gray membrane also may be a sign of skin diphtheria 
It may happen especially among people with poor hygiene who live in crowded conditions 
If you re not sure whether your child has been vaccinated against diphtheria, schedule an appointment 
The bacterium usually multiplies on or near the surface of the throat or skin 
Risk factors People who are at increased risk of catching diphtheria include 
Anyone who travels to an area where diphtheria infections are more common 
However, diphtheria is still common in developing countries where vaccination rates are low 
The diphtheria toxin may spread through the bloodstream and damage other tissues in the body 
At its worst, myocarditis can lead to heart failure and sudden death 
Typical targets are nerves to the throat, where poor nerve conduction may cause difficulty swallowing 
Nerves to the arms and legs also may become inflamed, causing muscle weakness 
At that point, you might need mechanical assistance to breathe 
With treatment, most people with diphtheria survive these complications, but recovery is often slow 
Diphtheria is fatal about to of the time 
Today, the disease is not only treatable but also preventable with a vaccine 
The diphtheria vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for tetanus and whooping cough pertussis 
The three in one vaccine is known as the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine 
The next booster shot is recommended years later, then repeated at year intervals 
Booster shots are particularly important if you travel to an area where diphtheria is common 
This combination vaccine is given by injection, usually into the arm or thigh 
It s also recommended once during pregnancy, regardless of previous vaccinations 
The shoulder is the body s most flexible joint, which makes it more likely to dislocate 
If you suspect a dislocated shoulder, seek prompt medical attention 
Most people regain full use of their shoulder within a few weeks 
However, once a shoulder dislocates, the joint might be prone to repeat dislocations 
The muscles in the shoulder might spasm, which can increase the pain 
When to see a doctorGet medical help right away for a shoulder that appears dislocated 
Splint or sling the shoulder joint in the position it s in 
Don t try to move the shoulder or force it back into place 
This can damage the shoulder joint and its surrounding muscles, ligaments, nerves or blood vessels 
Apply ice to the shoulder to help reduce pain and swelling 
Causes The shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated joint of the body 
Because it moves in several directions, the shoulder can dislocate forward, backward or downward 
Shoulder dislocation is a common injury in contact sports, such as football and hockey 
A hard blow to the shoulder during a motor vehicle accident can cause dislocation 
Complications Complications of a dislocated shoulder might include 
Tearing of the muscles, ligaments and tendons that reinforce the shoulder joint 
Nerve or blood vessel damage in or around the shoulder joint 
Becoming more prone to repeat dislocations, especially if the injury is severe 
Exercise regularly to maintain strength and flexibility in joints and muscles 
Having a dislocated shoulder joint can increase the risk of future shoulder dislocations 
These conditions include escape from reality in ways that are not wanted and not healthy 
Times of stress can worsen symptoms for a while, making them easier to see 
Treatment for dissociative disorders may include talk therapy, also called psychotherapy, and medicine 
SymptomsSymptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorder, but may include 
A sense of being separated from yourself and your emotions 
Thinking that people and things around you are distorted and not real 
Severe stress or problems in relationships, work or other important areas of life 
Not being able to cope well with emotional or work related stress 
Memory loss, also called amnesia, of certain time periods, events, people and personal information 
Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors 
Symptoms, which can be very distressing, may last hours, days, weeks or months 
The memory loss can t be explained by a medical condition 
It may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years 
Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat 
More rarely, it can involve complete loss of memory about yourself 
It sometimes may involve travel or confused wandering away from your life 
Dissociative identity disorderFormerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder involves switching to other identities 
Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and features 
There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others 
Or use the Lifeline Chat at lifeline org chat Services are free and confidential 
The stress of war or natural disasters also can bring on dissociative disorders 
Other shocking, distressing or painful events also may cause dissociative disorders to arise 
These may include war, natural disasters, kidnapping, torture, extensive early life medical procedures or other events 
Physical symptoms such as lightheadedness or seizures that are not due to epilepsy 
Major problems in personal relationships, at school and at work 
Ask for help finding resources such as parenting support groups and family therapists 
Or you may be able to contact mental health services directly 
They are found most often in the lower part of the large intestine colon 
Diverticula are common, especially after age , and seldom cause problems 
Mild diverticulitis can be treated with rest, changes in your diet and antibiotics 
Pain, which may be constant and persist for several days 
The lower left side of the abdomen is the usual site of the pain 
Causes Diverticula usually develop when naturally weak places in your colon give way under pressure 
This causes marble sized pouches to protrude through the colon wall 
Diverticulitis occurs when diverticula tear, resulting in inflammation, and in some cases, infection 
Risk factors Several factors may increase your risk of developing diverticulitis 
People who smoke cigarettes are more likely than nonsmokers to experience diverticulitis 
Complications About of people with acute diverticulitis develop complications, which may include 
An abscess, which occurs when pus collects in the pouch 
An abnormal passageway fistula between sections of bowel or the bowel and other organs 
Exercise promotes normal bowel function and reduces pressure inside your colon 
Try to exercise at least minutes on most days 
Fiber works by absorbing water and increasing the soft, bulky waste in your colon 
But if you don t drink enough liquid to replace what s absorbed, fiber can be constipating 
Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors 
Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life 
Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms 
SymptomsPeople experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as 
These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head 
The episode may last seconds or days and may recur 
Causes Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects 
Sometimes it s caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury 
The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes 
Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it s moving 
Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions 
Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back and forth motion 
Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving 
Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion 
This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you re spinning or moving 
A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo 
If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis 
This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear 
It s characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours 
It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly 
Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness 
Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness 
This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin 
This is especially true if you take certain heart medications 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include 
They re also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness 
If you ve experienced dizziness before, you re more likely to get dizzy in the future 
Complications Dizziness can increase your risk of falling and injuring yourself 
In a female fetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes 
As the fetus grows, the tubes typically join to create one larger, hollow organ 
A double uterus may have one opening into one vagina 
This divides the vagina in two, with two separate openings 
Women who have a double uterus often have successful pregnancies 
But the condition can make you more likely to have a miscarriage or premature birth 
The condition may be discovered during a regular pelvic exam 
Or it may be found during imaging tests to find the cause of repeated miscarriages 
Or if you have severe pain during your periods or you have repeated miscarriages 
Causes Health experts don t know exactly why some fetuses develop a double uterus 
Risk factors The risk factors for a double uterus are not well understood 
Genetics likely plays a role, along with other unknown factors 
Complications Many women with a double uterus have active sex lives 
But sometimes a double uterus and other uterine factors can cause 
Double outlet right ventricleDouble outlet right ventricle is a heart condition present at birth 
Sometimes these blood vessels also are reversed from their usual positions 
In a typical heart, the aorta connects to the left lower heart chamber 
The pulmonary artery connects to the right lower heart chamber 
Babies with double outlet right ventricle also have a hole between the lower heart chambers 
The hole causes oxygen rich blood to mix with oxygen poor blood 
Babies with this condition may not get enough oxygen in the bloodstream 
Double outlet right ventricle may occur with other heart problems present at birth 
DiagnosisA test called an echocardiogram can diagnose double outlet right ventricle 
The test uses sound waves to create images of the beating heart 
It can show blood flow through the heart and heart valves 
If more details about the heart are needed, other tests may be done 
Others may have surgery at a few months of age 
The type of surgery depends on the specific heart problems 
The heart surgeon may do one or more of the following 
Correct the aorta and pulmonary artery positions, if they re reversed 
Insert a blood vessel to connect the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery 
This lets more blood flow if the pulmonary artery is small 
Widen a narrowed pulmonary artery to allow more blood flow 
The heart surgeon places the shunt between the baby s aorta and the pulmonary artery 
A person born with double outlet right ventricle needs regular health checkups for life 
Adults should see a health care provider trained in evaluating and treating congenital heart conditions 
This type of provider is called an adult congenital cardiologist 
This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome 
Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals, causing lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays 
It s the most common genetic chromosomal disorder and cause of learning disabilities in children 
It also commonly causes other medical abnormalities, including heart and gastrointestinal disorders 
Some people are healthy while others have significant health problems such as serious heart defects 
Children and adults with Down syndrome have distinct facial features 
Broad, short hands with a single crease in the palm 
Tiny white spots on the colored part iris of the eye called Brushfield s spots 
Intellectual disabilitiesMost children with Down syndrome have mild to moderate cognitive impairment 
Language is delayed, and both short and long term memory is affected 
When to see a doctorChildren with Down syndrome usually are diagnosed before or at birth 
One chromosome in each pair comes from your father, the other from your mother 
Down syndrome results when abnormal cell division involving chromosome occurs 
These cell division abnormalities result in an extra partial or full chromosome 
Any one of three genetic variations can cause Down syndrome 
This mosaic of normal and abnormal cells is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization 
There are no known behavioral or environmental factors that cause Down syndrome 
Is it inherited Most of the time, Down syndrome isn t inherited 
It s caused by a mistake in cell division during early development of the fetus 
Translocation Down syndrome can be passed from parent to child 
These heart problems can be life threatening and may require surgery in early infancy 
Young children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of leukemia 
Having Down syndrome also increases the risk of developing Alzheimer s disease 
Life expectancyLife spans have increased dramatically for people with Down syndrome 
Overview Dressler syndrome is inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart pericarditis 
The damage can result from a heart attack, surgery or traumatic injury 
Symptoms include chest pain, which can feel like chest pain from a heart attack 
Causes Experts think Dressler syndrome is caused by the immune system s response to heart damage 
Dressler syndrome may occur after certain heart surgeries or procedures 
Inflammation of the pericardium can cause fluid to build up in the sac pericardial effusion 
Recurring or chronic inflammation can cause the pericardium to become thick or scarred 
The scarring can reduce the heart s ability to pump blood 
Rather, it is a sign of an underlying neurological, muscular or anatomical problem 
Sometimes foot drop is temporary, but it can be permanent 
In some cases, the skin on the top of the foot and toes feels numb 
Depending on the cause, foot drop can affect one or both feet 
A serious knee injury can lead to the nerve being compressed 
So can other neurologic disorders, such as polio or Charcot Marie Tooth disease 
The peroneal nerve controls the muscles that lift the foot 
Activities that compress this nerve can increase the risk of foot drop 
People who habitually cross their legs can compress the peroneal nerve on their uppermost leg 
A drug allergy is the reaction of the immune system to a medicine 
Any medicine nonprescription, prescription or herbal can provoke a drug allergy 
However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medicines 
The most common symptoms of drug allergy are hives, rash or fever 
A drug allergy is not the same as a drug side effect 
A side effect is a known possible reaction to a medicine 
Side effects to medicines are listed on their drug labels 
SymptomsSymptoms of a serious drug allergy often occur within an hour after taking a drug 
Other reactions, particularly rashes, can occur hours, days or weeks later 
Chemicals released by this activity cause the symptoms associated with an allergic reaction 
You may not be aware of your first exposure to a drug, however 
Some allergic reactions may result from a somewhat different process 
Pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others and naproxen sodium Aleve 
However, a drug reaction isn t triggered by immune system activity 
This condition is called a nonallergic hypersensitivity reaction or pseudoallergic drug reaction 
Drugs that are more commonly associated with this condition include 
Increased exposure to a drug, because of high doses, repeated use or prolonged use 
Be sure that your drug allergy is clearly identified in your medical records 
Inform other health care providers, such as your dentist or any medical specialist 
Less often, a condition directly affecting the salivary glands can cause dry mouth 
Hundreds of medicines, including many medicines available without a prescription, can cause dry mouth 
Many older people have symptoms of dry mouth as they age 
This may be for a limited time, with typical salivary flow returning after treatment ends 
Radiation treatments to the head and neck can damage salivary glands, greatly lowering saliva production 
Or dry mouth could be due to autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome or HIV AIDS 
Snoring and breathing with the mouth open can lead to dry mouth 
Drinking alcohol and smoking or chewing tobacco can lead to more dry mouth symptoms 
Use of legal or illegal drugs that may be sold on the streets 
Methamphetamine use can cause serious dry mouth, and it can damage teeth 
Risk factors Risk of dry mouth is higher in people who 
Take medicines that have dry mouth listed as a possible side effect 
Have other health conditions, such as diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer s disease, Sjogren syndrome or HIV AIDS 
Complications Not having enough saliva and getting dry mouth can lead to 
A yeast infection in the mouth, also known as thrush 
Sores or split skin at the corners of the mouth, or cracked lips 
Overview Dry skin makes the skin look and feel rough, itchy, flaky or scaly 
The location where these dry patches form vary from person to person 
It s a common condition that affects people of all ages 
Try various products and skin care routines to find an approach that works for you 
Skin that ranges from reddish on white skin to grayish on brown and black skin 
You ve tried self care steps but your signs and symptoms persist 
You develop dry, thick skin as a side effect of cancer treatment 
Causes Dry skin is due to water loss from the outer layer of skin 
Central heating, wood burning stoves, space heaters and fireplaces all reduce humidity 
Bathing more than once a day can remove the natural oils from your skin too 
But you re more likely to develop the condition if you 
Are over , as the skin s ability to retain moisture diminishes with age 
Use your hands to work with cement, clay or soil 
Have certain diseases or conditions, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes or malnutrition 
But when it s not cared for, dry skin may lead to 
Dry skin may crack, allowing bacteria to enter, causing infections 
These complications are most likely to occur when your skin s protective mechanisms are severely compromised 
Moisturizer seals in water to help keep your skin s protective barrier healthy 
Keep bath and shower time to minutes or less 
Apply a moisturizing cream while your skin is still damp 
If you shave, use a lubricating agent before you start 
Shave in the direction of hair growth, unless that irritates your skin 
Use a sharp blade and rinse it with warm water after each stroke 
Cover as much skin as possible in cold or windy weather 
Scarves, hats, and gloves or mittens help protect your skin when you re outdoors 
This is especially important if you ve been swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool 
For babies, using a cleanser every weeks for bathing usually is enough 
Other people have symptoms to hours after eating 
Generally, you can help prevent dumping syndrome by changing your diet after surgery 
Changes might include eating smaller meals and limiting high sugar foods 
In more serious cases of dumping syndrome, you may need medications or surgery 
Late dumping syndrome starts to hours after you eat a high sugar meal 
Some people have both early and late signs and symptoms 
You are losing large amounts of weight due to dumping syndrome 
Risk factors Surgery that alters your stomach can increase your risk of dumping syndrome 
Gastrectomy, in which a portion or all of your stomach is removed 
Fundoplication, a procedure used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD and hiatal hernia 
They eventually create a thick cord that can pull the fingers into a bent position 
Dupuytren contracture most often affects the two fingers farthest from the thumb 
Treatments can relieve symptoms and slow how quickly the condition gets worse 
The condition begins with a firm lump in the palm of the hand 
This cord tightens and pulls the finger toward the palm, sometimes severely 
Dupuytren contracture most commonly affects the two fingers farthest from the thumb 
Risk factors Risk factors for Dupuytren contracture include 
Dupuytren contracture occurs most commonly after the age of 
Men are much more likely to develop Dupuytren than are women 
In men, symptoms may be worse and progress more quickly 
People of Northern European descent are at higher risk of the disease 
Some studies show a connection between Dupuytren contracture and workers who use vibrating tools 
People with diabetes have an increased risk of Dupuytren contracture 
Smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol both increase the risk of Dupuytren contracture 
Or, you may need surgery to disconnect or remove the dAVF 
SymptomsSome people with a dAVF may not have any symptoms 
However, noticeable symptoms can be characterized either as aggressive or benign 
Symptoms related to increased pressure such as headaches, nausea and vomiting 
In rare cases, progressive dementia may occur due to venous hypertension 
However, dAVFs can occur in younger age groups as well, including in children 
Overview Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical condition 
The average adult height among people with dwarfism is feet cm 
In general, the disorders are divided into two broad categories 
Medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood limit overall growth and development 
Some people prefer the term short stature or little people rather than dwarf or dwarfism 
So it s important to be sensitive to the preference of someone who has this disorder 
Disproportionate dwarfismMost people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature 
In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body 
Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities 
Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs 
Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers 
A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose 
Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita SEDC 
Adult height ranging from feet cm to just over feet cm 
So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they re proportionate to each other 
Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism 
Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts 
Causes Most dwarfism related conditions are genetic disorders, but the causes of some disorders are unknown 
AchondroplasiaAbout percent of people with achondroplasia are born to parents of average height 
Delays in motor skills development, such as sitting up, crawling and walking 
Pressure on the spinal cord at the base of the skull 
Progressive severe hunching or swaying of the back with back pain or problems breathing 
PregnancyWomen with disproportionate dwarfism may develop respiratory problems during pregnancy 
Public perceptionsMost people with dwarfism prefer not to be labeled by a condition 
People of average height may have misconceptions about people with dwarfism 
And the portrayal of people with dwarfism in modern movies often includes stereotypes 
Misconceptions can impact a person s self esteem and limit opportunities for success in school or employment 
Children with dwarfism are particularly vulnerable to teasing and ridicule from classmates 
Because dwarfism is relatively uncommon, children may feel isolated from their peers 
Dysarthria often causes slurred or slow speech that can be difficult to understand 
Treating the underlying cause of your dysarthria may improve your speech 
For dysarthria caused by prescription medications, changing or discontinuing the medications may help 
Inability to speak louder than a whisper or speaking too loudly 
When to see a doctorDysarthria can be a sign of a serious condition 
See your doctor if you have sudden or unexplained changes in your ability to speak 
Some medications, such as certain sedatives and seizure drugs, also can cause dysarthria 
Complications Because of the communication problems dysarthria causes, complications can include 
Communication problems may affect your relationships with family and friends and make social situations challenging 
In some people, dysarthria may lead to social isolation and depression 
The itchy blisters last a few weeks and often come back 
Treatment for dyshidrosis most often includes prescription steroid skin creams or ointments 
The right treatment depends on how severe your symptoms are 
The blisters are small about the width of a standard pencil lead 
They are grouped in clusters and can look like tapioca 
With severe disease, the small blisters can merge to form larger blisters 
Skin affected by dyshidrosis can be painful and very itchy 
After a few weeks, the blisters dry and flake off 
Dyshidrosis tends to come back regularly for months or years 
Risk factors Risk factors for dyshidrosis include 
Dyshidrosis appears to be more common during times of emotional or physical stress 
These include cobalt and nickel often in an industrial setting 
Complications For most people with dyshidrosis, it s just an itchy inconvenience 
For others, the pain and itching may limit the use of their hands or feet 
Intense scratching can increase the risk of a bacterial infection of the affected skin 
After healing, you may notice skin color changes in the affected area 
It s more likely to occur in people with brown or Black skin 
This complication most often goes away in time without treatment 
Good skin care practices may help protect the skin as well 
Using mild, nonsoap cleansers and lukewarm water to wash your hands 
For wet activities, you might try wearing cotton gloves under waterproof gloves 
Dyslexia is not due to problems with intelligence, hearing or vision 
Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program 
Though there s no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome 
Severity varies, but the condition often becomes apparent as a child starts learning to read 
Before schoolSigns that a young child may be at risk of dyslexia include 
School ageOnce your child is in school, dyslexia symptoms may become more apparent, including 
Difficulty finding the right word or forming answers to questions 
Difficulty seeing and occasionally hearing similarities and differences in letters and words 
Inability to sound out the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word 
Spending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading or writing 
Teens and adultsDyslexia signs in teens and adults are a lot like those in children 
When dyslexia goes undiagnosed and untreated, childhood reading difficulties continue into adulthood 
Causes Dyslexia results from individual differences in the parts of the brain that enable reading 
This can have negative long term educational, social and economic impacts 
It can also cause hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, which can make dyslexia harder to treat 
Overview Painful intercourse can happen for reasons that range from structural problems to psychological concerns 
Many people have painful intercourse at some point in their lives 
It is lasting or recurrent genital pain that occurs just before, during or after sex 
Talk with your healthcare professional if you re having painful intercourse 
Treatments focus on the cause and can help stop or ease this common problem 
Treating the problem can help your sex life, your emotional intimacy and your self image 
Emotional factors can be linked to many types of painful intercourse 
Entry painPain during penetration might be associated with a range of factors, including 
Those medicines include antidepressants, high blood pressure medicines, sedatives, antihistamines and certain birth control pills 
An infection in the genital area or urinary tract can cause painful intercourse 
Eczema or other skin problems in the genital area also can be the cause 
These involuntary spasms of the muscles of the vaginal wall can make penetration painful 
Scarring from pelvic surgery, including hysterectomy, can cause painful intercourse 
Your pelvic floor muscles tend to tighten in response to stress in your life 
Not everyone with dyspareunia has a history of sexual abuse 
But if you have been abused, it can play a role 
It can be hard to tell whether emotional factors are associated with dyspareunia 
You might start avoiding sex if you associate it with the pain 
Risk factors Many factors can raise the risk of painful intercourse 
They include illnesses, surgeries and other medical treatments, and mental health issues 
Indigestion can also be a symptom of other digestive disorders 
Although indigestion is common, each person may experience indigestion in a slightly different way 
Symptoms of indigestion may be felt occasionally or as often as daily 
Indigestion may often be relieved with lifestyle changes and medicines 
You feel an uncomfortable sensation of tightness in your upper abdomen 
When to see a doctorMild indigestion is usually nothing to worry about 
Consult your health care provider if discomfort lasts for more than two weeks 
Contact your provider right away if pain is severe or accompanied by 
Shortness of breath, sweating or chest pain radiating to the jaw, neck or arm 
Often, indigestion is related to lifestyle and may be triggered by food, drink or medicine 
You might miss work or school because of your symptoms 
Overview Persistent depressive disorder is a continuous, long term form of depression 
You may also have low self esteem, feel like a failure and feel hopeless 
Because persistent depressive disorder is long term, coping with depression symptoms can be challenging 
A combination of talk therapy and medicine can be effective in treating this condition 
SymptomsPersistent depressive disorder symptoms usually come and go over a period of years 
But symptoms usually don t disappear for more than two months at a time 
Also, major depression episodes may occur before or during persistent depressive disorder 
Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder can cause major problems in your life and may include 
But if you have any symptoms of persistent depressive disorder, seek medical help 
Causes The exact cause of persistent depressive disorder is not known 
As with major depression, it may involve more than one cause, such as 
People with persistent depressive disorder may have physical changes in their brains 
Certain factors appear to increase the risk of developing persistent depressive disorder, including 
History of other mental health disorders, such as a personality disorder 
Complications Conditions that may be linked with persistent depressive disorder include 
Strategies that may help reduce or prevent symptoms include the following 
Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent symptoms from worsening 
Consider getting long term treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms 
Overview Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes the muscles to contract involuntarily 
They may be painful, and they can interfere with your performance of daily tasks 
There s no cure for dystonia, but medications and therapy can improve symptoms 
Begin in a single area, such as your leg, neck or arm 
Focal dystonia that begins after age usually starts in the neck, arm or face 
Occur during a specific action, such as writing by hand 
Your eyes might feel dry, gritty or sensitive to light 
You might experience slurred speech, drooling, and difficulty chewing or swallowing 
Oromandibular dystonia can be painful and often occurs in combination with cervical dystonia or blepharospasm 
Symptoms usually don t happen when your arm is at rest 
See your health care provider if you re having involuntary muscle contractions 
Dystonia can also be a symptom of another disease or condition, including 
Brain tumor or certain disorders that develop in some people with cancer paraneoplastic syndromes 
Complications Depending on the type of dystonia, complications can include 
Physical disabilities that affect your performance of daily activities or specific tasks 
Pain and fatigue, due to constant contraction of your muscles 
Most types of E coli are harmless or cause relatively brief diarrhea 
Healthy adults usually recover from infection with E coli O H within a week 
Diarrhea, which may range from mild and watery to severe and bloody 
When to see a doctorContact your doctor if your diarrhea is persistent, severe or bloody 
Causes Only a few strains of E coli trigger diarrhea 
You develop an E coli infection when you ingest this strain of bacteria 
Potential sources of exposure include contaminated food or water and person to person contact 
Ground beef combines meat from many different animals, increasing the risk of contamination 
Runoff from cattle farms can contaminate fields where fresh produce is grown 
Certain vegetables, such as spinach and lettuce, are particularly vulnerable to this type of contamination 
Rural water supplies are the most likely to be contaminated 
Risk factors E coli can affect anyone who is exposed to the bacteria 
But some people are more likely to develop problems than are others 
Complications Most healthy adults recover from E coli illness within a week 
But color isn t a good guide to know if the meat is done cooking 
Meat especially if grilled can brown before it s completely cooked 
Never put cooked hamburgers on the same plate you used for raw patties 
Wash your hands after preparing or eating food, using the bathroom, or changing diapers 
Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections 
SymptomsThe onset of signs and symptoms of ear infection is usually rapid 
When to see a doctorSigns and symptoms of an ear infection can indicate several conditions 
It s important to get an accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment 
Symptoms are present in a child less than months of age 
You observe a discharge of fluid, pus or bloody fluid from the ear 
Causes An ear infection is caused by a bacterium or virus in the middle ear 
The throat end of the tubes open and close to 
Swollen eustachian tubes can become blocked, causing fluids to build up in the middle ear 
This fluid can become infected and cause the symptoms of an ear infection 
This may occur because the fluid buildup persists after an ear infection has gotten better 
It may also occur because of some dysfunction or noninfectious blockage of the eustachian tubes 
This makes children susceptible to new ear infections and may affect hearing 
Chronic suppurative otitis media, an ear infection that doesn t go away with the usual treatments 
Risk factors Risk factors for ear infections include 
The children in group settings are exposed to more infections, such as the common cold 
Ear infections are most common during the fall and winter 
Ear infections that happen again and again can lead to serious complications 
Untreated infections or infections that don t respond well to treatment can spread to nearby tissues 
Infection of the mastoid, the bony protrusion behind the ear, is called mastoiditis 
This infection can result in damage to the bone and the formation of pus filled cysts 
PreventionThe following tips may reduce the risk of developing ear infections 
Teach your children to cough or sneeze into their elbow 
If possible, limit the time your child spends in group child care 
Try to keep your child home from child care or school when ill 
If possible, breast feed your baby for at least six months 
Breast milk contains antibodies that may offer protection from ear infections 
If you bottle feed, hold your baby in an upright position 
Avoid propping a bottle in your baby s mouth while he or she is lying down 
Ask your doctor about what vaccinations are appropriate for your child 
Seasonal flu shots, pneumococcal and other bacterial vaccines may help prevent ear infections 
Doctors often classify swimmer s ear according to mild, moderate and advanced stages of progression 
Severe pain that might radiate to your face, neck or side of your head 
Call your doctor immediately or visit the emergency room if you have 
Causes Swimmer s ear is an infection that s usually caused by bacteria 
It s less common for a fungus or virus to cause swimmer s ear 
A thin, water repellent, slightly acidic film lines the ear canal and discourages bacterial growth 
How the infection occursIf you have swimmer s ear, your natural defenses have been overwhelmed 
The conditions that often play a role in infection include 
Moisture in the ear canal that creates an ideal environment for bacterial growth 
Damage to the sensitive skin of the ear canal that creates an opening for infection 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of swimmer s ear include 
Complications Swimmer s ear usually isn t serious if treated promptly, but complications can occur 
You might have muffled hearing that usually gets better after the infection clears 
Rarely, swimmer s ear can spread into deep layers and connective tissues of the skin 
Dry only your outer ear, wiping it gently with a soft towel 
This solution promotes drying and helps prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi 
Wear earplugs or a swimming cap while swimming to keep your ears dry 
It s best to leave it alone and let earwax do its job 
When finished irrigating, tip your head to the side to let the water drain out 
When finished, gently dry your outer ear with a towel or blow dryer 
Ruptured eardrum perforated eardrum Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
It can also make the middle ear vulnerable to infections 
A ruptured eardrum usually heals within a few weeks without treatment 
But sometimes it requires a patch or surgical repair to heal 
Causes Causes of a ruptured perforated eardrum may include 
A middle ear infection often results in the accumulation of fluids in the middle ear 
Pressure from these fluids can cause the eardrum to rupture 
Barotrauma is most often caused by air pressure changes associated with air travel 
Small objects, such as a cotton swab or hairpin, can puncture or tear the eardrum 
The size and location of the tear can affect the degree of hearing loss 
A ruptured perforated eardrum can allow bacteria to enter the ear 
In this small group, chronic drainage and hearing loss can occur 
Ear canal debris normally travels to the outer ear with the help of ear protecting earwax 
Children with middle ear infections often are fussy and may refuse to eat 
Seek prompt evaluation from your provider to prevent potential damage to the eardrum 
During takeoffs and landings, keep ears clear with pressure equalizing earplugs, yawning or chewing gum 
Overview Precocious puberty is when children s bodies begin to change into adult bodies too soon 
However, Black, Hispanic, and Native American children might naturally reach puberty earlier 
Precocious puberty is when puberty begins too early for the child who s going through it 
Treatment for precocious puberty usually includes medicines to delay puberty 
Testicle and penis growth, facial hair and deeper voice in boys 
The brain starts the process by making a hormone called gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH 
There are two types of precocious puberty central precocious puberty and peripheral precocious puberty 
Central precocious pubertyThe cause of this type of precocious puberty often isn t known 
With central precocious puberty, puberty starts too soon but develops as usual 
In rare cases, the following can cause central precocious puberty 
A rare genetic disease that affects bones and skin color and causes hormonal problems 
A condition called hypothyroidism in which the thyroid gland doesn t make enough hormones 
Peripheral precocious pubertyEstrogen or testosterone being made too soon causes this type of precocious puberty 
Instead, the cause is the release of estrogen or testosterone into the body 
A problem with the ovaries, testicles, adrenal glands or pituitary gland causes the hormone release 
Being exposed to creams or ointments that contain estrogen or testosterone 
In girls, peripheral precocious puberty also might be linked to 
In boys, peripheral precocious puberty also might be caused by 
A tumor in the cells that make sperm or in the cells that make testosterone 
This can cause boys, usually between ages and , to make testosterone too early 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of precocious puberty include 
Girls are more likely than boys are to have precocious puberty 
This can cause them to be shorter than average as adults 
But there are things that can lower children s chances of precocious puberty, including 
Keep anything that contains estrogen or testosterone away from children 
These might include prescription medicines for adults or diet supplements 
Overview Eating disorders are serious health conditions that affect both your physical and mental health 
The most common eating disorders are anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder 
Most eating disorders involve focusing too much on weight, body shape and food 
These behaviors can seriously affect the ability to get the nutrition your body needs 
Eating disorders can harm the heart, digestive system, bones, teeth and mouth 
They re also linked with depression, anxiety, self harm, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors 
Anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder are the most common eating disorders 
People with eating disorders can have all different body types and sizes 
AnorexiaAnorexia an o REK see uh , also called anorexia nervosa, can be a life threatening eating disorder 
BulimiaBulimia buh LEE me uh , also called bulimia nervosa, is a serious, sometimes life threatening eating disorder 
Bulimia includes episodes of bingeing, commonly followed by episodes of purging 
Sometimes bulimia also includes severely limiting eating for periods of time 
This often leads to stronger urges to binge eat and then purge 
Some people change medicine doses, such as changing insulin amounts, to try to lose weight 
Binge eating disorderBinge eating disorder involves eating food in a short amount of time 
When bingeing, it feels like there s no control over eating 
During a binge, people may eat food faster or eat more food than planned 
Even when not hungry, eating may continue long past feeling uncomfortably full 
After a binge, people often feel a great deal of guilt, disgust or shame 
They may try to severely limit eating for periods of time 
This leads to increased urges to binge, setting up an unhealthy cycle 
A new round of bingeing commonly occurs at least once a week 
The pattern of eating often doesn t meet minimum daily nutrition needs 
This may lead to problems with growth, development and functioning in daily life 
But people with this disorder don t have fears about gaining weight or body size 
Or they may worry about what can happen when eating 
The disorder can result in major weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood 
A lack of proper nutrition can lead to major health problems 
The earlier you get treatment, the more likely you ll make a full recovery 
But these problem eating behaviors can still seriously affect health and well being 
Also, guilt and shame often prevent people from getting help 
Skipping meals or snacks or making excuses for not eating 
Having a very limited diet that hasn t been prescribed by a trained medical professional 
Making own meals rather than eating what the family eats 
Frequent checking in the mirror for what are thought to be flaws 
Using dietary supplements, laxatives or herbal products for weight loss 
Calluses on the knuckles from reaching fingers into the mouth to cause vomiting 
Problems with loss of tooth enamel that may be a sign of repeated vomiting 
Leaving during meals or right after a meal to use the toilet 
Talk of depression, disgust, shame or guilt about eating habits 
If needed, get a referral to a mental health provider with expertise in eating disorders 
Or if your insurance permits it, contact an expert directly 
Causes The exact cause of eating disorders is not known 
As with other mental health conditions, there may be different causes, such as 
Some people may have genes that increase their risk of developing eating disorders 
Biological factors, such as changes in brain chemicals, may play a role in eating disorders 
Eating disorders often start in the teen and young adult years 
Certain factors may increase the risk of developing an eating disorder, including 
And stress may increase the risk of an eating disorder 
Complications Eating disorders cause a wide variety of complications, some of them life threatening 
Choose a healthy diet rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables 
Don t use dietary supplements, laxatives or herbal products for weight loss 
Each week, get at least minutes of aerobic activity, such as brisk walking 
Choose activities that you enjoy, so you re more likely to do them 
For more guidelines on food and nutrition, as well as physical activity, go to health gov 
Talk to a health care provider if you have concerns about your eating behaviors 
Getting treatment early can prevent the problem from getting worse 
ChildrenHere are some ways to help your child develop healthy eating behaviors 
Family dining habits may influence the relationships children develop with food 
Talk to your child about the risks of making unhealthy eating choices 
Encourage and reinforce a healthy body image in your child, whatever their shape or size 
Talk to your child about self image and offer reassurance that body shapes can vary 
Don t criticize your own body in front of your child 
Messages of acceptance and respect can help build healthy self esteem 
They also can build resilience the ability to recover quickly from difficult events 
Overview Ebstein anomaly is a rare heart problem that s present at birth 
As a result, the valve does not close as it should 
In people with Ebstein anomaly, the heart can grow larger 
SymptomsSome babies born with Ebstein anomaly have few or no symptoms 
Others have a tricuspid valve that leaks severely and causes more noticeable problems 
Depending on skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see 
Feeling of a pounding or rapid heartbeat or irregular heartbeats 
Make a health appointment if you or your baby have symptoms of heart problems 
Causes Ebstein anomaly is a heart problem that a person is born with 
To understand more about Ebstein anomaly, it may help to know how the heart works 
Four valves open and close to let blood flow in one direction through the heart 
Each valve has two or three strong, thin flaps of tissue 
A valve that is closed stops blood from flowing into the next chamber 
A closed valve also prevents blood from going back to the previous chamber 
In a typical heart, the tricuspid valve sits between the two right heart chambers 
Also, the shape of the tricuspid valve s flaps is changed 
This can cause blood to flow backward into the right upper heart chamber 
When this happens, the condition is called tricuspid valve regurgitation 
A hole in the heart can lower the amount of oxygen in the blood 
Or there may be an opening called a patent foramen ovale PFO 
Heart arrhythmias may feel like a fluttering, pounding or racing heartbeat 
Risk factors Ebstein anomaly occurs as the baby grows in the womb during pregnancy 
Researchers aren t sure exactly what increases the risk of a baby having Ebstein anomaly 
But pregnancy, labor and delivery put extra strain on the heart 
Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed during pregnancy 
Premature ventricular contractions PVCs Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Premature ventricular contractions are a common type of irregular heartbeat arrhythmia 
But the extra beats can cause unusual sensations in the chest, such as 
The sinus node sends electrical signals that typically start each heartbeat 
This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood 
PVCs are irregular contractions that start in the ventricles instead of the atria 
The contractions usually beat sooner than the next expected heartbeat 
Heart disease or scarring may cause the heart s signals to be misrouted 
Increased levels of adrenaline in the body due to exercise or anxiety 
Normally, the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus 
This type of ectopic pregnancy is called a tubal pregnancy 
If you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive 
As the fertilized egg grows in the improper place, signs and symptoms become more noticeable 
Your specific symptoms depend on where the blood collects and which nerves are irritated 
Symptoms of this life threatening event include extreme lightheadedness, fainting and shock 
Hormonal imbalances or abnormal development of the fertilized egg also might play a role 
If you ve had this type of pregnancy before, you re more likely to have another 
The chance of getting pregnant while using an intrauterine device IUD is rare 
Cigarette smoking just before you get pregnant can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy 
Complications An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst open 
Without treatment, the ruptured tube can lead to life threatening bleeding 
If you do, quit before you try to get pregnant 
Overview Ectropion ek TROH pee on is a condition in which your eyelid turns outward 
This leaves the inner eyelid surface exposed and prone to irritation 
Ectropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid 
In severe ectropion, the entire length of the eyelid is turned out 
In less severe ectropion, only one segment of the eyelid sags away from the eye 
Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of ectropion 
But usually surgery is needed to fully correct the condition 
These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids puncta 
Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids 
Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy 
Seek immediate care if you have been diagnosed with ectropion and you experience 
These are signs and symptoms of cornea exposure or ulcers, which can harm your vision 
As you age, the muscles under your eyes tend to weaken, and tendons stretch out 
These muscles and tendons hold your eyelid taut against your eye 
Facial paralysis that affects eyelid muscles can lead to ectropion 
Benign or cancerous growths on your eyelid can cause the lid to turn outward 
When it is, it s usually associated with genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing ectropion include 
The most common cause of ectropion is weakening muscle tissue associated with aging 
People who have had eyelid surgery are at higher risk of developing ectropion later 
Complications Ectropion leaves your cornea irritated and exposed, making it more susceptible to drying 
The result can be abrasions and ulcers on the cornea, which can threaten your vision 
Having erection trouble from time to time isn t necessarily a cause for concern 
If you re concerned about erectile dysfunction, talk to your doctor even if you re embarrassed 
Sometimes, treating an underlying condition is enough to reverse erectile dysfunction 
In other cases, medications or other direct treatments might be needed 
Erectile dysfunction can result from a problem with any of these 
Likewise, stress and mental health concerns can cause or worsen erectile dysfunction 
Sometimes a combination of physical and psychological issues causes erectile dysfunction 
The resulting anxiety can lead to or worsen erectile dysfunction 
Physical causes of erectile dysfunctionIn many cases, erectile dysfunction is caused by something physical 
Peyronie s disease development of scar tissue inside the penis 
Surgeries or injuries that affect the pelvic area or spinal cord 
A number of things can interfere with sexual feelings and cause or worsen erectile dysfunction 
You might need more direct touch to your penis to get and keep an erection 
Certain medical treatments, such as prostate surgery or radiation treatment for cancer 
Injuries, particularly if they damage the nerves or arteries that control erections 
Medications, including antidepressants, antihistamines and medications to treat high blood pressure, pain or prostate conditions 
Drug and alcohol use, especially if you re a long term drug user or heavy drinker 
Complications Complications resulting from erectile dysfunction can include 
Work with your doctor to manage diabetes, heart disease or other chronic health conditions 
See your doctor for regular checkups and medical screening tests 
Stop smoking, limit or avoid alcohol, and don t use illegal drugs 
Get help for anxiety, depression or other mental health concerns 
Overview Edema is swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body s tissues 
But it s more likely to show up in the legs and feet 
Wearing compression garments and reducing salt in the diet often relieves edema 
When a disease causes edema, the disease needs treatment, as well 
Swelling or puffiness of the tissue right under the skin, especially in legs or arms 
Swelling of the belly, also called the abdomen, so that it s bigger than usual 
These can be signs of fluid buildup in the lungs, also known as pulmonary edema 
Edema also can be a side effect of some medicines 
Sometimes edema can be a sign of a more serious condition 
As a result, blood can back up in the legs, ankles and feet, causing edema 
Congestive heart failure can also cause swelling in the stomach area 
This condition also can cause fluid to build up in the lungs 
Known as pulmonary edema, this can lead to shortness of breath 
This liver damage from cirrhosis can cause fluid to build up in the stomach area 
This fluid buildup in the stomach area is known as ascites 
Kidney disease can cause fluid and salts in the blood to build up 
Edema linked to kidney disease usually occurs in the legs and around the eyes 
Damage to the tiny, filtering blood vessels in the kidneys can result in nephrotic syndrome 
In nephrotic syndrome, decreased levels of protein in the blood can lead to edema 
This condition, known as chronic venous insufficiency, harms the one way valves in the leg 
Damage to the valves allows blood to pool in the leg veins and causes swelling 
Problems with the system in the body that clears extra fluid from tissues 
An extreme lack of protein in the diet over time can lead to edema 
Risk factors The following increases the risk of edema 
Having a long lasting illness, such as congestive heart failure or liver or kidney disease 
Less ability of the of arteries, veins, joints and muscles to stretch 
But fluid can collect in the lungs for other reasons 
Treatment for pulmonary edema depends on the cause but generally includes additional oxygen and medications 
SymptomsPulmonary edema symptoms may appear suddenly or develop over time 
A feeling of suffocating or drowning that worsens when lying down 
A cough that produces frothy sputum that may have blood in it 
Anxiety, restlessness or a feeling that something bad is about to happen 
More shortness of breath than usual when you re physically active 
Symptoms are similar to those that occur with acute pulmonary edema and can include 
Shortness of breath with activity, which becomes shortness of breath at rest 
Not being able to exercise as much as you once could 
Symptoms of high altitude pulmonary edema HAPE tend to get worse at night 
When to see a doctorPulmonary edema that comes on suddenly acute pulmonary edema is life threatening 
Call or emergency medical help if you have any of the following acute symptoms 
Coughing up phlegm that looks pink or has blood in it 
A big drop in blood pressure that causes lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness or sweating 
Instead, call or emergency medical care and wait for help 
Pulmonary edema falls into two categories, depending on where the problem starts 
If a heart problem causes the pulmonary edema, it s called cardiogenic pulmonary edema 
Most often, the fluid buildup in the lungs is due to a heart condition 
If pulmonary edema is not heart related, it s called noncardiogenic pulmonary edema 
Sometimes, pulmonary edema can be caused by both a heart problem and a nonheart problem 
How the lungs workLungs contain many small, elastic air sacs called alveoli 
With each breath, these air sacs take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide 
But sometimes, the alveoli fill with fluid instead of air 
worksThe typical heart is made of two upper and two lower chambers 
From there it s pumped through large blood vessels pulmonary arteries to the lungs 
The oxygen rich blood then returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins 
It then flows through the mitral valve into the left ventricle 
The aortic valve keeps the blood from flowing backward into the heart 
From the aorta, the blood travels to the rest of the body 
Heart related cardiogenic pulmonary edemaCardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by increased pressures in the heart 
The increased pressure pushes fluid through the blood vessel walls into the air sacs 
Medical conditions that can cause heart failure and lead to pulmonary edema include 
A slow narrowing of the coronary arteries can weaken the left ventricle 
Sometimes, a blood clot forms in one of these narrowed arteries 
A damaged heart muscle can no longer pump as well as it should 
With cardiomyopathy, the heart must pump harder, and pressures rise 
A valve leak that develops suddenly might cause sudden and severe pulmonary edema 
Untreated or uncontrolled high blood pressure can enlarge the heart 
This serious disorder occurs when the lungs suddenly fill with fluid 
With treatment, most people with this type of pulmonary edema recover in about hours 
Blood transfusions may cause fluid overload in the left ventricle, leading to pulmonary edema 
Viruses such as the hantavirus and dengue virus can cause pulmonary edema 
Complications Complications of pulmonary edema depend on the cause 
Buildup of fluid in the membranes that surround the lungs pleural effusion 
Immediate treatment is necessary for acute pulmonary edema to prevent death 
For example, controlling cholesterol and blood pressure can help lower the risk of heart disease 
Preventing high altitude pulmonary edema HAPE To prevent HAPE, gradually ascend to high elevations 
To prevent HAPE, start taking the medication at least one day before ascent 
People who have Ehlers Danlos syndrome usually have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin 
Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual 
They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily 
In fair skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin 
A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal 
Complications Complications depend on the types of signs and symptoms you have 
For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early onset arthritis 
Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture 
Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus 
If treated quickly with appropriate antibiotics, you ll likely recover within a few days 
Untreated ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis can result in serious or life threatening complications 
The best way to prevent these infections is to avoid tick bites 
Symptoms of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis, which vary widely from person to person, include 
Additional signs and symptoms associated with ehrlichiosis but rarely with anaplasmosis include 
Black legged ticks, commonly called deer ticks, in the Upper Midwest are less common carriers 
The ehrlichia and anaplasma species belong to the same family of bacteria 
Risk factors Ticks live near the ground in wooded or brushy areas 
Factors that increase your risk of a tick bite include 
Participating in activities in wooded areas, such as camping, hiking or hunting 
Wearing clothes that leave your skin exposed in tick friendly habitat 
People with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk of more serious and life threatening complications 
Do not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 
Wear long sleeved shirts tucked into your pants and long pants tucked into your socks 
Do a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors 
Stay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas 
In Eisenmenger syndrome, there is irregular blood flow in the heart and lungs 
This causes the blood vessels in the lungs to become stiff and narrow 
Blood pressure rises in the lungs arteries pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Eisenmenger syndrome permanently damages the blood vessels in the lungs 
Early diagnosis and repair of congenital heart defects usually prevents Eisenmenger syndrome 
If it does develop, treatment involves regular medical visits and medications to improve symptoms 
Blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels cyanosis 
Make an appointment even if you have never been diagnosed with a heart problem 
Symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain require medical attention 
A shunt is a heart problem present at birth congenital heart defect 
Some of the valves in the heart also may not work properly 
In any of these heart problems, blood flows in a way it usually doesn t 
Over time, the increased pressure damages the smaller blood vessels in the lungs 
The damaged blood vessel walls make it difficult to pump blood to the lungs 
The blue blood goes through the hole shunt in the heart or blood vessels 
Without proper treatment and monitoring, complications of Eisenmenger syndrome may include 
The reversed blood flow through the heart reduces oxygen to the body s tissues and organs 
Eisenmenger syndrome causes the heart walls to get bigger and thicker 
Some arrhythmias increase the risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks or strokes 
This is the sudden loss of heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm 
If not treated immediately, sudden cardiac arrest can quickly lead to death 
The increased pressure in the heart can cause the heart muscle to weaken 
Eisenmenger syndrome can cause life threatening bleeding in the lungs and airways 
This can cause you to cough up blood and further lower your blood oxygen levels 
Bleeding can also occur in other parts of the body 
Low oxygen levels in the blood may lead to problems with the kidneys 
Eisenmenger syndrome can increase the risk of a type of arthritis called gout 
People with Eisenmenger syndrome have a higher risk of a heart infection called endocarditis 
During pregnancy, the heart and lungs have to work harder to support the growing baby 
If you have Eisenmenger syndrome, talk to your care provider about your specific pregnancy risks 
Elevated blood pressure Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury mm Hg 
Blood pressure is lower than millimeters of mercury mm Hg 
Hg and the bottom number is below not above mm 
Hg or higher or the bottom number is mm 
But elevated blood pressure tends to get worse over time unless it s properly managed 
That s why it s important to regularly check and control your blood pressure 
The only way to detect it is to have regular blood pressure checks 
Have your blood pressure measured when you visit your health care provider 
You can also check it at home with a home blood pressure monitoring device 
Causes Anything that increases pressure on the artery walls can lead to elevated blood pressure 
Sometimes, the cause of the elevated or high blood pressure isn t identified 
Conditions and medications that can cause elevated blood pressure include 
Heart problem affecting blood vessels present at birth congenital heart defect 
Risk factors Anyone can have elevated blood pressure, even children 
Obesity makes you more likely to have high blood pressure 
High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease and strokes 
Sodium and potassium are two nutrients that the body needs to control blood pressure 
Smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco or being around smoke secondhand smoke can increase blood pressure 
Alcohol use has been linked with elevated blood pressure, particularly in men 
Simply getting older raises the risk for increased blood pressure 
For some children, kidney or heart problems can cause high blood pressure 
It increases the risk of heart attacks, heart failure, strokes, aneurysms and kidney failure 
PreventionThe same healthy lifestyle changes recommended to treat elevated blood pressure also help prevent it 
Rarely, the clot forms in a vein in another part of the body 
Trouble catching your breath happens even when resting and gets worse with physical activity 
The pain is often sharp and felt when you breathe in deeply 
The pain can stop you from being able to take a deep breath 
You also may feel it when you cough, bend or lean over 
You may pass out if your heart rate or blood pressure drops suddenly 
Leg pain or swelling, or both, usually in the back of the lower leg 
When to see a doctorA pulmonary embolism can be life threatening 
Seek urgent medical attention if you experience unexplained shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting 
The portions of lung served by each blocked artery can t get blood and may die 
Medical conditions and treatmentsSome medical conditions and treatments put you at risk, such as 
Heart and blood vessel disease, specifically heart failure, makes clot formation more likely 
Surgery is one of the leading causes of problem blood clots 
Some inherited disorders affect blood, making it more likely to clot 
Other medical disorders such as kidney disease also can increase the risk of blood clots 
People who have severe symptoms of COVID have an increased risk of pulmonary embolism 
Clots are more likely to form when blood slows or pools 
About one third of people with an undiagnosed and untreated pulmonary embolism don t survive 
When the condition is diagnosed and treated promptly, however, that number drops dramatically 
This restricts blood flow and results in chronic pulmonary hypertension 
PreventionPreventing clots in the deep veins in your legs will help prevent pulmonary embolisms 
For this reason, most hospitals are aggressive about taking measures to prevent blood clots, including 
These medicines are often given to people at risk of clots before and after surgery 
Compression stockings steadily squeeze the legs, helping veins and leg muscles move blood more efficiently 
Elevating your legs when possible and during the night can be very effective 
This massages and squeezes the veins in your legs and improves blood flow 
Your provider might suggest the following to help prevent blood clots during travel 
Move around the airplane cabin once an hour or so 
Your provider may recommend these to help promote circulation and fluid movement in your legs 
Compression stockings are available in a range of stylish colors and textures 
There are even devices, called stocking butlers, to help you put on the stockings 
Embryonal tumorsEmbryonal tumors are uncontrolled growths of cells in the brain 
The growths involve cells that are left over from fetal development, called embryonal cells 
Embryonal tumors are a type of brain cancer, also called malignant brain tumor 
Embryonal tumors most often happen in babies and young children 
DiagnosisYour health care team reviews your child s medical history and symptoms 
During this procedure, vision, hearing, balance, strength, coordination and reflexes are tested 
This helps find out which part of the brain might be affected by the tumor 
The pictures may show pressure or blockages of the fluid in the brain 
CT and MRI are often used to diagnose brain tumors 
Advanced techniques, such as perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, also may be used 
The sample is often taken during surgery to remove the tumor 
The tissue is looked at in a lab to determine the types of cells 
The needle draws out the fluid from around the spinal cord 
Which treatments are best for your child depends on your child s age 
Your child s health care team also considers the type of embryonal tumor and its location 
Some embryonal tumors may block the flow of fluid in the brain 
This can cause a buildup of fluid that puts pressure on the brain, called hydrocephalus 
Sometimes this procedure can be combined with surgery to remove the tumor 
A brain surgeon removes as much of the tumor as possible 
During radiation therapy, a machine directs beams of energy to specific points on the body 
Many chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein, but some are taken in pill form 
These studies give your child a chance to try the latest treatment options 
The risk of side effects for these treatments may not be known 
Overview Emphysema is a lung condition that causes shortness of breath 
In people with emphysema, the air sacs in the lungs alveoli are damaged 
Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are two conditions that make up chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD 
Treatment may slow the progression of COPD, but it can t reverse the damage 
SymptomsYou can have emphysema for many years without noticing any signs or symptoms 
The main symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath, which usually begins gradually 
Emphysema eventually causes shortness of breath even while you re at rest 
Don t ignore it by telling yourself it s because you re aging or out of shape 
Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray with exertion 
The main cause of emphysema is long term exposure to airborne irritants, including 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing emphysema include 
Complications People who have emphysema are also more likely to develop 
Emphysema can increase the pressure in the arteries that connect the heart and lungs 
Some people with emphysema develop empty spaces in the lungs called bullae 
PreventionTo prevent emphysema, don t smoke and avoid breathing secondhand smoke 
Wear a mask to protect your lungs if you work with chemical fumes or dust 
There are several causes, including viral infection, autoimmune inflammation, bacterial infection, insect bites and others 
When inflammation is caused by an infection in the brain, it s known as infectious encephalitis 
SymptomsEncephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or problems with movement 
Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu like symptoms, such as 
Loss of sensation or being unable to move certain areas of the face or body 
In infants and young children, signs and symptoms also might include 
Bulging in the soft spots of an infant s skull, known as fontanels 
In cases of autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks 
Flu like symptoms are less common, but can sometimes happen weeks before more severe symptoms start 
Problems understanding what is real and what is not, known as psychosis 
A severe headache, fever and change in consciousness require urgent care 
Infants and young children with any signs or symptoms of encephalitis should receive urgent care 
Causes In approximately half of patients, the exact cause of encephalitis is not known 
In those for whom a cause is identified, there are two main types of encephalitis 
This condition occurs when a virus or other agent directly infects the brain 
Very rarely, encephalitis may be caused by bacteria, fungus or parasites 
The exact reason why this happens is not completely understood 
In many instances, no definitive trigger for the abnormal immune response is identified 
The Powassan virus is carried by ticks and causes encephalitis in the Midwestern United States 
Symptoms usually appear about a week after a bite from an infected tick 
Rabies is a rare cause of encephalitis in the United States 
Some types of encephalitis are more common or more severe in certain age groups 
Mosquito or tick borne viruses are common in particular geographical regions 
People who already have an autoimmune condition may be more prone to develop autoimmune encephalitis 
Complications The complications of encephalitis vary, depending on factors such as 
People with relatively mild illness usually recover within a few weeks with no long term complications 
These complications can vary widely in severity and can include 
Make sure they practice good hygiene and avoid sharing utensils at home and school 
Before traveling, talk to your health care provider about recommended vaccinations for different destinations 
Protection against mosquitoes and ticksTo minimize your exposure to mosquitoes and ticks 
Chemicals such as DEET can be applied to both the skin and clothes 
If you re using both sunscreen and a repellent, apply sunscreen first 
These products can be sprayed on clothing, tents and other outdoor gear 
Refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes are most common 
If possible, avoid being outdoors from dusk till dawn, when mosquitoes are most active 
Eliminate standing water in your yard, where mosquitoes can lay their eggs 
Common problems include flowerpots or other gardening containers, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters 
Instead, cover an infant carrier or stroller with mosquito netting 
For older infants and children, repellents with to DEET are considered safe 
Apply the repellent when outdoors to lessen the risk of inhaling the repellent 
Spray repellent on your hands and then apply it to your child s face 
Wash treated skin with soap and water when you come indoors 
In most cases, soiling is a symptom of long standing constipation 
Far less frequently it occurs without constipation and may be the result of emotional issues 
Encopresis can be frustrating for parents and embarrassing for the child 
However, with patience and positive reinforcement, treatment for encopresis is usually successful 
Leakage of stool or liquid stool on underwear, which can be mistaken for diarrhea 
Passage of large stool that clogs or almost clogs the toilet 
Causes There are several causes of encopresis, including constipation and emotional issues 
ConstipationMost cases of encopresis are the result of chronic constipation 
In constipation, the child s stool is hard, dry and may be painful to pass 
As a result, the child avoids going to the toilet making the problem worse 
Emotional stressors, for example, the divorce of a parent or the birth of a sibling 
Risk factors Encopresis is more common in boys than in girls 
These risk factors may increase the chances of having encopresis 
Using medications that may cause constipation, such as cough suppressants 
PreventionBelow are some strategies that can help prevent encopresis and its complications 
Learn about effective toilet training techniquesEducate yourself on effective toilet training techniques 
Avoid starting too early or being too forceful in your methods 
With end stage renal disease, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive 
SymptomsEarly in chronic kidney disease, you might have no signs or symptoms 
As chronic kidney disease progresses to end stage renal disease, signs and symptoms might include 
Ask your provider whether these tests are necessary for you 
Diseases and conditions that can lead to kidney disease include 
Glomerulonephritis gloe mer u low nuh FRY tis an inflammation of the kidney s filtering units glomeruli 
Frequent use of medications that could be damaging to the kidney 
Potential complications can affect almost any part of your body and can include 
Limit protein and eat a balanced diet of nutritious, low sodium foods 
Without quick treatment, endocarditis can damage or destroy the heart valves 
A new or changed whooshing sound in the heart murmur 
A proper evaluation by a health care provider is needed to make the diagnosis 
Causes Endocarditis is usually caused by an infection with bacteria, fungi or other germs 
The germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart 
In the heart, they attach to damaged heart valves or damaged heart tissue 
Usually, the body s immune system destroys any harmful bacteria that enter the bloodstream 
Having a faulty, diseased or damaged heart valve increases the risk of the condition 
However, endocarditis may occur in those without heart valve problems 
A history of endocarditis also increases the risk of infection 
Using dirty needles can lead to infections such as endocarditis 
A healthy mouth and healthy gums are essential for good health 
A catheter is a thin tube that s used to do some medical procedures 
If you re at risk of endocarditis, tell your health care providers 
You may want to request an endocarditis wallet card from the American Heart Association 
Check with your local chapter or print the card from the association s website 
They can break loose and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys and other organs 
Pockets of collected pus abscesses that develop in the heart, brain, lungs and other organs 
PreventionYou can take the following steps to help prevent endocarditis 
Good dental hygiene is an important part of maintaining your overall health 
Dirty needles can send bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of endocarditis 
Preventive antibioticsCertain dental and medical procedures may allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream 
You re at high risk of endocarditis and need antibiotics before dental work if you have 
They attach to the uterine wall by a large base or a thin stalk 
Uterine polyps are most common in people who are going through or have completed menopause 
Some people have only light bleeding or spotting others are symptom free 
When to see a doctorSeek medical care if you have 
Uterine polyps are estrogen sensitive, meaning they grow in response to estrogen in the body 
Risk factors Risk factors for developing uterine polyps include 
It often affects the ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining the pelvis 
Rarely, endometriosis growths may be found beyond the area where pelvic organs are located 
But it grows in places where it doesn t belong, and it doesn t leave the body 
When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form 
These can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other 
But treatments can help you take charge of the condition and its complications 
You re most likely to have these symptoms before or during a menstrual period 
Sometimes, you may have heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods 
For some people, endometriosis is first found during tests for infertility treatment 
These symptoms are more common before or during menstrual periods 
You could have a small amount of tissue with bad pain 
Or you could have lots of endometriosis tissue with little or no pain 
You may be better able to take charge of the symptoms if 
Your care team finds the disease sooner rather than later 
The blood contains endometrial cells from the inner lining of the uterus 
These cells may stick to the pelvic walls and surfaces of pelvic organs 
Risk factors Factors that raise the risk of endometriosis include 
Short menstrual cycles for instance, less than days 
One or more relatives with endometriosis, such as a mother, aunt or sister 
The symptoms may get better for a time with pregnancy 
Pain may become milder over time with menopause, unless you take estrogen therapy 
Complications InfertilityThe main complication of endometriosis is trouble getting pregnant, also called infertility 
Up to half of people with endometriosis have a hard time conceiving 
For pregnancy to happen, an egg must be released from an ovary 
Endometriosis may block the tube and keep the egg and sperm from uniting 
But the condition also seems to affect fertility in less direct ways 
Health care professionals sometimes advise those with endometriosis not to delay having children 
CancerSome studies suggest that endometriosis raises the risk of ovarian cancer 
But the overall lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is low to begin with 
An imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone causes it 
Pseudogynecomastia is an increase in fat but not gland tissue in male breasts 
But it can be tough to cope with the condition 
When to see a doctorSee a member of your health care team if you have 
Causes In people assigned male at birth, the body mainly makes the sex hormone testosterone 
Gynecomastia can happen when the amount of testosterone in the body drops compared with estrogen 
The decrease can be caused by conditions that lower testosterone or block its effects 
Or it can be caused by conditions that raise the estrogen level 
Some things that can change the body s hormone balance include the following 
Natural hormone changesThe hormones testosterone and estrogen control sex traits 
Testosterone controls traits such as muscle mass and body hair 
The swollen breast tissue usually goes away within to weeks after birth 
Gynecomastia caused by hormone changes during puberty is somewhat common 
About to of men ages to get gynecomastia 
Anti androgens used to treat conditions such as an enlarged prostate and prostate cancer 
Examples of these medicines include flutamide, finasteride Proscar, Propecia and spironolactone Aldactone, Carospir 
Anabolic steroids and androgens to treat delayed puberty or muscle loss from another disease 
The estrogen like properties of some HIV medicines can cause gynecomastia, especially efavirenz 
Ulcer medicines, such as the nonprescription medicines cimetidine Tagamet HB and omeprazole Prilosec 
Heart medicines, such as digoxin Lanoxin and calcium channel blockers 
Recreational drugs, illegal drugs and alcoholSubstances that can cause gynecomastia include 
Anabolic steroids used to build muscle and improve athletic performance 
Conditions that lower the amount of testosterone the body makes can be linked with gynecomastia 
Hormone changes that happen with aging can cause gynecomastia, especially in people who are overweight 
Some tumors can make hormones that shift the body s hormone balance 
These include tumors involving the testes, adrenal glands or pituitary gland 
In this condition, the thyroid gland makes too much of the hormone thyroxine 
About half the people who receive dialysis treatment develop gynecomastia due to hormone changes 
Changes in hormone levels related to liver problems and cirrhosis medicines are linked with gynecomastia 
When the body doesn t get enough nutrition, testosterone levels drop 
Herbal productsSome plant oils used in shampoos, soaps or lotions have been associated with gynecomastia 
Risk factors Risk factors for gynecomastia include 
These include liver and kidney disease, thyroid disease, Klinefelter syndrome and some tumors 
PreventionSeveral factors within your control may lower the risk of gynecomastia 
That means no more than two drinks a day for men 
Enlarged liver Overview An enlarged liver is one that s bigger than normal 
Treatment involves identifying and controlling the cause of the condition 
When enlarged liver results from liver disease, it might be accompanied by 
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes jaundice 
The size of the liver varies with age, sex and body size 
A disorder that causes abnormal protein to accumulate in your liver amyloidosis 
A genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in your liver Wilson s disease 
A disorder that causes iron to accumulate in your liver hemachromatosis 
A disorder that causes fatty substances to accumulate in your liver Gaucher s disease 
Cancer that begins in another part of the body and spreads to the liver 
Blockage of the veins that drain the liver Budd Chiari syndrome 
Factors that can increase your risk of liver problems include 
Drinking large amounts of alcohol can be damaging to your liver 
Acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States 
Check with your doctor if you re not sure what s too much 
Infectious diseases, viral, bacterial or parasitic, can increase your risk of liver damage 
Choose a diet full of fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
Use aerosol cleaners, insecticides and other toxic chemicals only in well ventilated areas 
Eat a balanced diet and limit foods that are high in sugar and fat 
Overview Your spleen is an organ that sits just below your left rib cage 
A doctor usually can t feel the spleen in an adult unless it s enlarged 
Imaging and blood tests can help identify the cause of an enlarged spleen 
Treatment for an enlarged spleen depends on what s causing it 
Surgery to remove an enlarged spleen usually isn t needed, but sometimes it s recommended 
SymptomsAn enlarged spleen typically causes no signs or symptoms, but sometimes it causes 
Pain or fullness in the left upper belly that can spread to the left shoulder 
Causes A number of infections and diseases can cause an enlarged spleen 
Bacterial infections, such as syphilis or an infection of your heart s inner lining endocarditis 
Blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms, and lymphomas, such as Hodgkin s disease 
Its size generally relates to your height, weight and sex 
This soft, spongy organ performs several critical jobs, such as 
Storing red blood cells and platelets, which help your blood clot 
When it s enlarged, your spleen may not function as usual 
People who live in or travel to areas where malaria is common 
Even healthy spleens are soft and easily damaged, especially in car crashes 
The possibility of rupture is much greater when your spleen is enlarged 
A ruptured spleen can cause life threatening bleeding in your belly 
Goiter Overview A goiter GOI tur is the irregular growth of the thyroid gland 
The most common cause of goiters worldwide is a lack of iodine in the diet 
Treatment depends on the cause of the goiter, symptoms, and complications resulting from the goiter 
Small goiters that aren t noticeable and don t cause problems usually don t need treatment 
Bone growth that outpaces expected growth for the child s age 
Obstructive goiterThe size or position of a goiter may obstruct the airway and voice box 
The hypothalamus is a specialized region at the base of the brain 
It acts as a thermostat for maintaining balance in multiple body systems 
In the United States, this cause is uncommon because of iodine added to table salt 
The damaged and inflamed tissues of the thyroid don t produce enough hormones hypothyroidism 
A nodule is the irregular growth of thyroid cells that form a lump 
A person may have one nodule or several nodules multinodular goiter 
Thyroid cancer is less common than other cancers and generally treatable 
About of people with thyroid nodules are found to have cancer 
It may be present at birth or occur at any time throughout life 
Iodine is found primarily in seawater and in the soil in coastal areas 
Women are more likely to develop a goiter or other thyroid disorders 
Thyroid problems in women are more likely to occur during pregnancy and menopause 
Family medical history of goiters or other thyroid disorders increases the risk of goiters 
Also, researchers have identified genetic factors that may be associated with an increased risk 
Your risk increases if you ve had radiation treatments to your neck or chest area 
The appearance may be troublesome or embarrassing for some people 
A large goiter may obstruct the airway and voice box 
Entropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid 
Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of entropion 
These are signs and symptoms of cornea injury, which can harm your vision 
Start using artificial tears and eye lubricating ointments to protect your eye before your appointment 
It can cause scarring of the inner eyelid, leading to entropion and even blindness 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing entropion include 
The older you are, the greater your chances of developing the condition 
You may be able to prevent the type caused by trachoma infection 
Overview Eosinophilic esophagitis e o sin o FILL ik uh sof uh JIE tis is a chronic immune system disease 
Food getting stuck in the esophagus after swallowing, also known as impaction 
Chest pain that is often centrally located and does not respond to antacids 
Failure to thrive, including poor growth, malnutrition and weight loss 
Causes Eosinophils are a typical type of white blood cells present in your digestive tract 
However, in eosinophilic esophagitis, you have an allergic reaction to an outside substance 
The lining of your esophagus reacts to allergens, such as food or pollen 
The eosinophils multiply in your esophagus and produce a protein that causes inflammation 
You may have other symptoms, such as chest pain or stomach pain 
Risk factors The following risk factors are associated with eosinophilic esophagitis 
Eosinophilic esophagitis is more common in males than in females 
If your family members have eosinophilic esophagitis, you have a greater chance of being diagnosed 
Complications In some people, eosinophilic esophagitis can lead to the following 
EpendymomaEpendymoma is a growth of cells that forms in the brain or spinal cord 
This fluid surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord 
A benign ependymoma may grow to press on nearby tissue 
A malignant ependymoma may grow to invade and destroy nearby tissue 
Cancerous cells can break away and spread within the brain or spinal cord 
Ependymoma can occur at any age, but most often happens in young children 
Ependymoma that occurs in adults is more likely to form in the spinal cord 
These may include radiation therapy, radiosurgery, chemotherapy or targeted therapy 
During a neurological exam, a healthcare professional checks vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes 
They can show the location and size of an ependymoma 
It may be used along with specialized MRI imaging, such as magnetic resonance angiography 
The needle draws out fluid from around the spinal cord 
Once removed, the tumor cells are tested in a lab to confirm the diagnosis 
Your healthcare team may use this information to guide treatment decisions 
SurgeryBrain surgeons, called neurosurgeons, work to remove as much of the ependymoma as possible 
If the entire tumor is removed during surgery, additional treatment may not be needed 
Radiation therapyRadiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill tumor cells 
Radiation therapy may be recommended after surgery to help prevent cancerous tumors from coming back 
It also may be recommended if neurosurgeons weren t able to remove the tumor completely 
Some special types of radiation therapy help focus the radiation treatment on the tumor cells 
These special types of radiation may reduce the risk of damage to nearby healthy cells 
Examples include conformal radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy and proton therapy 
It aims beams of radiation from many angles at the tumor 
Targeted therapyTargeted therapy uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the tumor cells 
Talk with your healthcare team if you re interested in a clinical trial 
Tennis elbow is often linked to repeated motions of the wrist and arm 
Despite its name, most people who get tennis elbow don t play tennis 
Some people have jobs that involve repeated movements that can lead to tennis elbow 
Rest, pain medicines and physical therapy often help relieve tennis elbow 
Causes Tennis elbow is often linked to overuse and muscle strain 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of tennis elbow include 
But it s most common in adults between the ages of and 
Not having good form or using poor equipment increases the risk even more 
Playing more than two hours a day also increases the risk 
Other factors that can increase the risk include smoking, being obese and certain medicines 
Overview Epidermolysis bullosa ep ih dur MOL uh sis buhl LOE sah is a rare condition that causes fragile, blistering skin 
The blisters may appear in response to minor injury, even from heat, rubbing or scratching 
Epidermolysis bullosa is inherited, and it usually shows up in infants or young children 
Some people don t develop symptoms until they re teens or young adults 
Epidermolysis bullosa has no cure, but mild forms may improve with age 
Treatment focuses on caring for blisters and preventing new ones 
Fragile skin that blisters easily, especially on the palms and feet 
The skin is made up of an outer layer epidermis and an underlying layer dermis 
The area where the layers meet is called the basement membrane 
The types of epidermolysis bullosa are mainly defined by which layers separate and form blisters 
It s brought on by heat and friction and develops in the outer layer of skin 
This type may be severe, with blisters beginning in infancy 
Diseased mucous membranes can cause constipation and make it hard to eat 
The blisters tend to show up in infancy or early childhood 
It increases sun sensitivity and causes skin to look thin, mottled and wrinkly 
Sepsis occurs when bacteria from an infection enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body 
Sepsis can spread rapidly and lead to shock and organ failure 
This can affect the function of the fingers, knees and elbows 
Problems with nutrition can also cause delayed wound healing and slowed growth in children 
Difficulty passing stool may be due to painful blisters in the anal area 
Blisters in the mouth and throat also make it harder to eat and breathe 
Your infant or child needs cuddling, but be very gentle 
If your child wears diapers, remove the elastic bands and avoid cleansing wipes 
Try to keep your home cool and the temperature steady 
Use soft clothing that s simple to get on and off 
It may help to remove labels and put on clothing seam side out to reduce scratching 
As your child grows, encourage activities that reduce the risk of skin injury 
Consider padding a car seat or bathing tub with sheepskin, foam or a thick towel 
Soft cotton or silk can be used as a top layer over the padding 
Sometimes, a testicle also becomes inflamed a condition called epididymo orchitis 
Epididymitis is usually treated with antibiotics and measures to relieve discomfort 
Testicle pain and tenderness, usually on one side, that often comes on slowly 
Pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen or pelvic area 
Sometimes the cause of chronic epididymitis isn t able to be found 
When to see a doctorDon t ignore scrotal pain or swelling 
Some of them need treatment right away to avoid permanent damage 
If you have severe pain in the scrotum, seek emergency treatment 
Gonorrhea and chlamydia are the most common causes of epididymitis in young, sexually active males 
Also, viral infections, such as the mumps virus, can result in epididymitis 
This condition occurs when urine flows backward into the epididymis, causing chemical irritation 
It may be the result of heavy lifting or straining 
Risk factors for epididymitis that s not sexually transmitted include 
A difference in the typical anatomy of the urinary tract 
Prostate enlargement, which increases the risk of bladder infections and epididymitis 
Other health conditions that cause a weakened immune system, such as HIV 
Epididymo orchitis, if the condition spreads from the epididymis to a testicle 
PreventionTo help protect against STIs that can cause epididymitis, practice safer sex 
The swelling blocks the flow of air into the lungs 
These factors include infections, burns from hot liquids and injuries to the throat 
Routine Hib vaccination for infants has made epiglottitis rare in children 
SymptomsSymptoms in childrenChildren can develop symptoms of epiglottitis within hours 
Symptoms in adultsAdults might get symptoms over days rather than hours 
Hib is responsible for other conditions, the most common being meningitis 
Hib is now much less common in developed countries where children get Hib vaccines 
Hib spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes droplets into the air 
It s possible to have Hib in the nose and throat without becoming sick 
In adults, other bacteria and viruses also can cause the epiglottis to swell 
This bacterium can cause meningitis, pneumonia, ear infection and blood infection 
This group of bacteria can cause diseases from strep throat to blood infection 
This bacterium causes skin infections and other diseases including pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome 
InjuryRarely, physical injury, such as a blow to the throat, can cause epiglottitis 
So can burns from drinking very hot liquids and breathing in smoke from a fire 
Risk factors Some factors increase the risk of getting epiglottitis, including 
In this life threatening condition, the level of oxygen in the blood drops very low 
Sometimes the bacteria that cause epiglottitis cause infections in other parts of the body 
PreventionHib vaccineGetting the Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib vaccine prevents epiglottitis caused by Hib 
In the United States, children usually receive the vaccine in three or four doses 
At months if the child is getting the four dose vaccine 
Medicine to prevent rejection of organ or bone marrow transplants 
These include redness, warmth, swelling or pain at the injection site, and a fever 
Some vaccinated children have had epiglottitis and other germs can cause epiglottitis too 
Use an alcohol based hand sanitizer if soap and water aren t available 
Epilepsy affects people of all genders, races, ethnic backgrounds and ages 
Some people may lose awareness during a seizure while others don t 
Some people stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure 
Others may repeatedly twitch their arms or legs, movements known as convulsions 
Treatment with medicines or sometimes surgery can control seizures for most people with epilepsy 
Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age 
Sometimes people with epilepsy may have changes in their behavior 
Most people with epilepsy tend to have the same type of seizure each time 
And some people may see things that aren t there, known as hallucinations 
They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound 
And focal seizures may cause sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights 
Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness 
This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream 
Focal seizures may come from any lobe of the brain 
Temporal lobe seizures begin in the areas of the brain called the temporal lobes 
The temporal lobes process emotions and play a role in short term memory 
The aura may include sudden emotion such as fear or joy 
During the seizure, people may lose awareness of their surroundings 
Frontal lobe seizures begin in the front of the brain 
This is the part of the brain that controls movement 
Frontal lobe seizures cause people to move their heads and eyes to one side 
They won t respond when spoken to and may scream or laugh 
They might extend one arm and flex the other arm 
They also might make repetitive movements such as rocking or bicycle pedaling 
These seizures begin in the area of the brain called the occipital lobe 
People who have this type of seizure may have hallucinations 
Or they may lose some or all of their vision during the seizure 
These seizures also might cause eye blinking or make the eyes move 
Generalized seizuresSeizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures 
Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children 
Symptoms include staring into space with or without subtle body movements 
Movements may include eye blinking or lip smacking and only last to seconds 
Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control 
Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes sudden falls to the ground 
Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic jerking muscle movements 
They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking 
They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting of the tongue 
You continue to have seizures even though you ve been taking anti seizure medicine 
If you have a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice 
Causes Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition 
In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including 
In these instances, it s likely that there s a genetic influence 
Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes 
Genetic changes can occur in a child without being passed down from a parent 
For most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy 
Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures 
Epilepsy also may be caused by the way blood vessels form in the brain 
People with blood vessel conditions such as arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations can have seizures 
And in adults older than age , stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy 
Meningitis, HIV, viral encephalitis and some parasitic infections can cause epilepsy 
They might include an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or not enough oxygen 
This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy 
People with autism are more likely to have epilepsy than are people without autism 
Seizure triggersSeizures can be triggered by things in the environment 
Seizure triggers don t cause epilepsy, but they may trigger seizures in people who have epilepsy 
Most people with epilepsy don t have reliable triggers that always cause a seizure 
However, they often can identify factors that make it easier to have a seizure 
Skipping doses of antiseizure medicines or taking more than prescribed 
Risk factors Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy 
You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car 
Stroke and other blood vessel diseases can cause brain damage 
You can take steps to reduce your risk of these diseases 
Limit alcohol, don t smoke, eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly 
Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults 
High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures 
Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won t develop epilepsy 
Complications Having a seizure at certain times can be dangerous to yourself or others 
If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone 
The risk is higher because you might have a seizure while in the water 
Many states have driver s license restrictions related to a driver s ability to control seizures 
The amount of time may range from months to years 
People who have epilepsy may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, known as insomnia 
Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby 
Also, certain anti seizure medicines increase the risk of birth defects 
Most women with epilepsy can become pregnant and have healthy babies 
It s very important that you work with your healthcare team to plan your pregnancy 
People with some types of epilepsy have trouble with memory 
Emotional health issuesPeople with epilepsy are more likely to have mental health conditions 
But even people with well controlled epilepsy are at increased risk 
Emotional health problems that may affect people with epilepsy include 
Other life threatening complications of epilepsy are not common but may happen 
Or it may occur if you have seizures without regaining full consciousness in between them 
People with status epilepticus have an increased risk of permanent brain damage and death 
People with epilepsy also have a small risk of sudden unexpected death 
Overall, about of people with epilepsy die of SUDEP 
It s most common in those with severe epilepsy that doesn t respond to treatment 
Overview Frontal lobe seizures are a common form of epilepsy 
This causes movements that can t be controlled, known as seizures 
Frontal lobe seizures also are known as frontal lobe epilepsy 
Surgery or electrical stimulation might be options if medicines don t reduce or stop the seizures 
For about half of people who have frontal lobe epilepsy, the cause is not known 
Risk factors Risk factors of frontal lobe seizures include 
Blood vessels or brain tissues that form in an irregular way 
Complications Frontal lobe seizures can cause complications that may include 
If these seizures continue, they can cause permanent brain damage or death 
Seizures that last longer than five minutes are medical emergencies 
People who have seizures have a greater risk than the average person of dying suddenly 
Possible factors include heart or breathing problems, perhaps related to genetic changes 
Children also have a higher risk of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD 
It often starts under the skin on the finger, hand, forearm, knee or lower leg 
Sometimes the growths cause sores on the skin that do not heal 
Epithelioid sarcoma is a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma 
Often health care providers consider those more common problems first 
Tests and procedures used in diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma include 
They can show the location and size of an epithelioid sarcoma 
Your health care team uses this information to make a treatment plan 
Sometimes other treatments may be used in addition to surgery 
Surgery involves removing the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it 
Taking some healthy tissue helps make sure that all the cancer cells are removed 
Getting all of the cancer cells lowers the risk that the cancer will come back 
Radiation therapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink the tumor 
These studies provide a chance to try the latest treatment options 
Parvovirus infection Overview Parvovirus infection is a common and highly contagious childhood illness 
It s sometimes called slapped cheek disease because of the distinctive face rash that develops 
In most children, parvovirus infection is mild and needs little treatment 
Parvovirus infection in some pregnant women can lead to serious health problems for the fetus 
SymptomsMost people with parvovirus infection have no signs or symptoms 
Parvovirus symptoms in childrenEarly signs and symptoms of parvovirus infection in children may include 
The rash may be itchy, especially on the soles of the feet 
Generally, the rash occurs near the end of the illness 
It s possible to mistake the rash for other viral rashes or a medicine related rash 
Parvovirus symptoms in adultsAdults don t usually develop the slapped cheek rash 
Joints most commonly affected are the hands, wrists, knees and ankles 
When to see a doctorGenerally, you don t need to see a doctor for parvovirus infection 
An infected pregnant woman can pass the virus to her baby 
The illness is contagious in the week before the rash appears 
Complications Parvovirus and anemiaParvovirus infection can cause serious complications for people with anemia 
The unborn children of women infected with parvovirus during pregnancy 
Parvovirus infection in pregnancyParvovirus infection during pregnancy sometimes affects red blood cells in the fetus 
Although uncommon, this may cause severe anemia that could lead to miscarriage or stillbirth 
Fetal risk appears to be greatest during the first half of the pregnancy 
Once you ve become infected with parvovirus, you get lifelong immunity 
Overview Esophageal spasms are painful contractions within the muscular tube connecting your mouth and stomach 
Some people may mistake it for heart pain, also called angina 
Esophageal spasms typically occur only occasionally and might not need treatment 
If esophageal spasms interfere with your ability to eat or drink, treatments are available 
Difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, sometimes related to swallowing specific substances 
Red wine or extremely hot or cold liquids are more common culprits 
The feeling that an object is stuck in your throat 
The return of food and liquids back up your esophagus, also called regurgitation 
If you experience squeezing chest pain, seek immediate medical care 
Risk factors There are no known risk factors for esophageal spasms 
Esophageal varices most often happen in people with serious liver diseases 
The vessels can leak blood or even burst, causing life threatening bleeding 
Yellow coloration of the skin and eyes, known as jaundice 
Also ask whether to get a procedure to check for esophageal varices 
Causes Esophageal varices sometimes form when blood flow to your liver is blocked 
Esophageal varices are more likely to bleed if you have 
The risk of bleeding increases as the pressure in the portal vein increases 
The larger the esophageal varices, the more likely they are to bleed 
Some esophageal varices show long, red streaks or red spots 
Complications The most serious complication of esophageal varices is bleeding 
Once you ve had a bleeding episode, your risk of another bleeding episode greatly increases 
If you lose enough blood, you can go into shock, which can lead to death 
PreventionCurrently, no treatment can prevent the development of esophageal varices in people with cirrhosis 
Reduce the amount of fatty and fried foods you eat 
An excess amount of body fat can damage your liver 
Obesity is associated with a greater risk of complications of cirrhosis 
Follow the directions on household chemicals, such as cleaning supplies and insect sprays 
The esophagus is the muscular tube that delivers food from your mouth to your stomach 
Swallowed food becoming stuck in the esophagus, also known as food impaction 
Chest pain, particularly behind the breastbone, that occurs with eating 
Feeding difficulties, such as irritability, arching of the back and not wanting to eat 
Are bad enough to make eating difficult or if you are losing weight 
Are accompanied by flu symptoms, such as headache, fever and muscle aches 
Have pain in your chest that lasts more than a few minutes 
Have a history of heart disease and experience chest pain 
Have pain in your mouth or throat when you eat 
Have shortness of breath or chest pain that happens shortly after eating 
Causes Esophagitis is generally labeled by the condition that causes it 
In some cases, it may have more than one cause 
But sometimes this valve doesn t close properly or opens when it shouldn t 
A complication of GERD is ongoing inflammation and tissue damage in the esophagus 
Eosinophilic esophagitisEosinophils e o SIN o fils are white blood cells that play a key role in allergic reactions 
This is most likely in response to an allergy causing agent allergen , acid reflux or both 
However, typical allergy testing does not reliably identify these culprit foods 
For example, sometimes allergens in the air, such as pollen, may be the cause 
LE may be related to eosinophilic esophagitis or to GERD 
Pain relieving medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others and naproxen sodium Aleve, others 
Bisphosphonates, including alendronate Fosamax , a treatment for weak and brittle bones, called osteoporosis 
Infectious esophagitisA bacterial, viral or fungal infection in tissues of the esophagus may cause esophagitis 
Several foods may worsen symptoms of GERD or reflux esophagitis 
Eosinophilic esophagitisRisk factors for eosinophilic esophagitis, or allergy related esophagitis, may include 
People with diabetes also are at increased risk of candida esophagitis in particular 
Other causes of infectious esophagitis may relate to poor immune system function 
This may be due to an immune disorder, HIV AIDS or certain cancers 
Complications Left untreated, esophagitis can lead to changes in the structure of the esophagus 
Scarring or narrowing of the esophagus, known as a stricture 
Other conditions don t cause essential tremor, although essential tremor is sometimes confused with Parkinson s disease 
Begin gradually, and usually are more noticeable on one side of the body 
Usually occur in the hands first, affecting one hand or both hands 
Can include a yes yes or no no motion of the head 
May be aggravated by emotional stress, fatigue, caffeine or temperature extremes 
Essential tremor of the hands usually occurs when using the hands 
Causes About half the people with essential tremor appear to have an altered gene 
It isn t clear what causes essential tremor in people who don t have familial tremor 
Risk factors Known risk factors for essential tremor include 
The inherited variety of essential tremor, known as familial tremor, is an autosomal dominant disorder 
An altered gene from just one parent is needed to pass on the condition 
Essential tremor is more common in people age and older 
Complications Essential tremor isn t life threatening, but symptoms often worsen over time 
If the tremors become severe, it might be difficult to 
This cancer usually affects adults in their s and s 
Esthesioneuroblastoma usually begins as a growth of cells, called a tumor, inside the nose 
It might grow and go into the sinuses, eyes and brain 
It also can spread to other parts of the body 
And they might have trouble breathing through their nose as the tumor grows 
Often, radiation and chemotherapy are part of the treatment as well 
In general, cancer happens when cells get changes in their DNA 
The changes tell the cells to make many more cells quickly 
In time, cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body 
Esthesioneuroblastoma can grow and get into the sinuses, eyes and brain 
Major advances in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma have improved the outlook for this cancer 
Healthcare professionals often suggest long term monitoring for side effects after treatment 
SymptomsEwing sarcoma signs and symptoms typically start in and around a bone 
This cancer most often affects bones in the legs and the pelvis 
When symptoms happen in and around a bone, they might include 
Sometimes Ewing sarcoma causes symptoms that affect the whole body 
Ewing sarcoma happens when cells develop changes in their DNA 
In Ewing sarcoma, the DNA changes most often affect a gene called EWSR 
Risk factors Risk factors for Ewing sarcoma include 
But it is more likely to happen in children and young adults 
Ewing sarcoma is more common in people of European ancestry 
It s much less common in people of African and East Asian ancestry 
Complications Complications of Ewing sarcoma and its treatment include the following 
Cancer that spreadsEwing sarcoma can spread from where it started to other areas 
Ewing sarcoma most often spreads to the lungs and to other bones 
Your healthcare team can help you manage the side effects that happen during treatment 
With hirsutism, extra hair growth often arises from excess male hormones androgens , primarily testosterone 
Self care methods and effective treatment options are available for women who wish to treat hirsutism 
Excess facial or body hair is often a symptom of an underlying medical problem 
This condition, which often begins with puberty, causes an imbalance of sex hormones 
This occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol 
Rarely, an androgen secreting tumor in the ovaries or adrenal glands can cause hirsutism 
Risk factors Several factors can influence your likelihood of developing hirsutism, including 
Being obese causes increased androgen production, which can worsen hirsutism 
Also, although hirsutism doesn t cause physical complications, the underlying cause of a hormonal imbalance can 
This type of bleeding is called abnormal uterine bleeding or irregular menstrual bleeding 
If you dread your period because you have heavy menstrual bleeding, talk with your doctor 
Getting up at night to change sanitary pads or tampons 
Feeling tired, fatigued or short of breath as the result of blood loss 
When to see a doctorSeek medical help before your next scheduled exam if you have 
Causes In some cases, the reason for heavy menstrual bleeding is unknown 
But a number of conditions may cause heavy menstrual bleeding 
In a typical menstrual cycle, there s a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone 
This controls the buildup of the lining of the uterus 
The lining of the uterus also is known as the endometrium 
Sometimes ovaries don t release an egg during a menstrual cycle 
A single, heavy, late period may be due to a miscarriage 
Some bleeding disorders that run in families cause heavy menstrual bleeding 
These include von Willebrand s disease, a condition in which the blood does not clot properly 
Some medicines can result in heavy or lengthy menstrual bleeding 
These include hormonal medicines such as birth control pills that have estrogen and progestin 
These medicines typically help lessen menstrual bleeding but sometimes cause unexpected bleeding between periods 
Medicines that prevent blood clots also may cause heavy menstrual bleeding 
They include warfarin Jantoven , enoxaparin Lovenox , apixaban Eliquis and rivaroxaban Xarelto 
A number of other medical conditions may cause heavy menstrual bleeding 
Usually, the release of an egg from the ovaries signals the body to make progesterone 
Progesterone is the hormone most responsible for keeping periods regular 
If no egg is released, the body does not make enough progesterone 
This can result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods 
Heavy menstrual bleeding can cause anemia related to blood loss 
The number of red blood cells is measured by hemoglobin 
Along with heavy menstrual bleeding, you might have painful menstrual cramps 
Talk to your doctor if your cramps make it hard to do your daily activities 
Exercise headaches Overview Exercise headaches occur during or after sustained, strenuous exercise 
Some activities associated with exercise headaches include running, rowing, tennis, swimming and weightlifting 
Causes Primary exercise headachesThe exact cause of primary exercise headaches is unknown 
One theory is that strenuous exercise dilates blood vessels inside the skull 
Secondary exercise headachesSecondary exercise headaches are caused by an underlying problem, such as 
Irregularities in a blood vessel leading to or within the brain 
Risk factors You may be at greater risk of exercise headaches if you 
If you re prone to exercise headaches, you may want to avoid exercising in these conditions 
A warm up prior to strenuous exercise also can help prevent exercise headaches 
They may look to you like black or gray specks, strings, or cobwebs 
Floaters appear to dart away when you try to look at them directly 
These can be symptoms of an emergency that requires prompt attention 
When to see a doctorContact an eye specialist immediately if you notice 
Flashes of light in the same eye as the floaters 
A gray curtain or blurry area that blocks part of your vision 
Darkness on a side or sides of your vision peripheral vision loss 
As the vitreous changes, collagen fibers within the vitreous form clumps and strings 
These scattered pieces block some of the light passing through the eye 
This casts tiny shadows on your retina that are seen as floaters 
Uveitis is inflammation in the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall uvea 
Causes of posterior uveitis include infection, autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases 
Without treatment, a retinal tear may lead to retinal detachment 
Certain medications that are injected into the vitreous can cause air bubbles to form 
These bubbles are seen as shadows until your eye absorbs them 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of eye floaters include 
Diabetes complication that causes damage to the blood vessels of the retina diabetic retinopathy 
In some cases, symptoms of eyestrain can indicate an underlying eye condition that needs treatment 
When to see a doctorSee an eye specialist if self care steps don t relieve your eyestrain 
Driving long distances and doing other activities involving focusing for a long time 
Having an underlying eye problem, such as dry eyes or uncorrected vision, called refractive error 
Computer use strains eyes more than reading print material because people tend to 
Blink less while using computers, and blinking is key to moistening the eyes 
View digital screens at less than ideal distances or angles 
Use devices with poor contrast between the text and the background 
Some other factors that can make the condition worse include 
Circulating air, such as from air conditioning or a nearby fan 
Complications Eyestrain doesn t have serious or long term consequences, but it can be aggravating and unpleasant 
It can make you tired and reduce your ability to concentrate 
Factitious disorder is challenging to identify and hard to treat 
Seeking treatment from many different doctors or hospitals, which may include using a fake name 
People with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways, such as 
Or they may falsify medical records to indicate an illness 
They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out 
They may take medications, such as blood thinners or drugs for diabetes, to mimic diseases 
They may also interfere with wound healing, such as reopening or infecting cuts 
They may manipulate medical instruments to skew results, such as heating up thermometers 
Offer support and caring and, if possible, help in finding treatment 
Risk factors Several factors may increase the risk of developing factitious disorder, including 
Loss of a loved one through death, illness or abandonment 
Past experiences during a time of sickness and the attention it brought 
Factitious disorder is considered rare, but it s not known how many people have the disorder 
Severe health problems from infections or unnecessary surgery or other procedures 
Most people with factor V Leiden never develop abnormal clots 
SymptomsThe factor V Leiden mutation does not itself cause any symptoms 
Some clots do no damage and disappear on their own 
Symptoms of a blood clot depend on what part of your body is affected 
Inheriting one copy slightly increases your risk of developing blood clots 
The disorder is most common in people who are white and of European descent 
Surgeries or injuries such as broken bones can increase your risk of abnormal blood clots 
Flatfeet can occur when the arches don t develop during childhood 
But some people with flatfeet experience foot pain, particularly in the heel or arch area 
Most people s arches develop throughout childhood, but some people never develop arches 
Or the collapse can happen over years of wear and tear 
As the severity increases, arthritis may develop in the foot 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of flatfeet include 
A baby born with the condition has four different heart problems 
Tetralogy of Fallot is usually diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after a baby is born 
People who are diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot need surgery to fix the heart 
Shortness of breath and rapid breathing, especially during feeding or exercise 
This usually happens when the baby cries, eats or is upset 
They are most common in young infants, around to months old 
Tet spells may be less noticeable in toddlers and older children 
That s because they typically squat when they re short of breath 
Seek medical help if you notice that your baby has these symptoms 
Causes Tetralogy of Fallot occurs as the baby s heart grows during pregnancy 
Narrowing of the valve between the heart and the lungs, called pulmonary valve stenosis 
This condition reduces blood flow from the heart to the lungs 
A hole between the bottom heart chambers, called a ventricular septal defect 
A ventricular septal defect changes how blood flows through the heart and lungs 
The heart has to work harder to pump blood through the body 
In tetralogy of Fallot, the aorta is in the wrong place 
It s shifted to the right and sits directly above the hole in the heart wall 
This changes how blood flows from the aorta to the lungs 
Thickening of the right lower chamber of the heart, called right ventricular hypertrophy 
Over time, this may cause the heart to become weak and eventually fail 
There also may be a hole between the heart s upper chambers, called atrial septal defect 
Risk factors The exact cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown 
Some things may increase the risk of a baby being born with tetralogy of Fallot 
Complications Untreated tetralogy of Fallot usually leads to life threatening complications 
The complications may cause disability or death by early adulthood 
Sometimes antibiotics are given before dental work to prevent this type of infection 
Ask your healthcare team if preventive antibiotics are right for you or your baby 
Complications also are possible after surgery to repair tetralogy of Fallot 
A hole in the heart that doesn t go away after surgery 
Swelling of part of the aorta, called aortic root dilation 
Another procedure or surgery may be needed to fix these complications 
Talk to your healthcare team about the possible risks and complications of pregnancy 
Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed 
Regular checkups with a healthcare team during pregnancy can help keep mom and baby healthy 
But for to percent of people, the genetic mutation occurs spontaneously 
FAP causes extra tissue polyps to form in your large intestine colon and rectum 
Some people have a milder form of the condition, called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis AFAP 
But some people develop the abnormal gene that causes the condition 
Complications In addition to colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis can cause other complications 
These polyps grow in the upper part of your small intestine and may become cancerous 
But with careful monitoring, duodenal polyps can often be detected and removed before cancer develops 
These polyps occur where the bile and pancreas ducts enter the duodenum ampulla 
Periampullary polyps might become cancerous but can often be detected and removed before cancer develops 
These are benign pigment changes in the retina of your eye 
These include extra teeth or teeth that don t come in 
PreventionPreventing FAP is not possible, since it is an inherited genetic condition 
If you have FAP, you will need regular screening, followed by surgery if needed 
Surgery can help prevent the development of colorectal cancer or other complications 
Familial hypercholesterolemia Overview Familial hypercholesterolemia affects the way the body processes cholesterol 
The condition is present from birth, but symptoms may not appear until adulthood 
People who inherit the condition from both parents usually develop symptoms in childhood 
They also can occur in the skin around the eyes 
Cholesterol deposits may thicken the Achilles tendon, along with some tendons in the hands 
Most people who have the condition receive one affected gene 
But in rare cases, a child can get the affected gene from both parents 
This can cause a more severe form of the condition 
Familial hypercholesterolemia may be more common in certain populations, including 
Heart attacks may occur before age in men and age in women 
Familial Mediterranean fever Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Symptoms Signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever usually begin during childhood 
They occur in bouts called attacks that last days 
Signs and symptoms of FMF attacks vary, but can include 
Chest pain, which can make it hard to breathe deeply 
Painful, swollen joints, usually in the knees, ankles and hips 
A red rash on your legs, especially below your knees 
Between attacks, you ll likely feel back to your typical health 
In some people, the first sign of FMF is amyloidosis 
In people with FMF, change occurs in a gene called MEFV 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of familial Mediterranean fever include 
Complications Complications can occur if familial Mediterranean fever isn t treated 
Buildup of this protein causes inflammation, which can cause organ damage 
Nephrotic syndrome occurs when your kidneys filtering systems glomeruli are damaged 
People with nephrotic syndrome may lose large amounts of protein in their urine 
The most commonly affected joints are the knees, ankles and hips 
Untreated inflammation caused by FMF may affect the reproductive organs, causing infertility 
These can include inflammation in the heart, lungs, spleen, brain and superficial veins 
Farsightedness usually is present at birth and tends to run in families 
You can easily correct this condition with eyeglasses or contact lenses 
You have eyestrain, including burning eyes, and aching in or around the eyes 
Every two to four years between ages and 
Every one to three years between ages and 
Ask your eye doctor how frequently you need to schedule your appointments 
The cornea is the clear, dome shaped front surface of your eye 
The lens is a clear structure about the size and shape of an M M s candy 
Other refractive errorsIn addition to farsightedness, other refractive errors include 
Complications Farsightedness can be associated with several problems, such as 
And your limited vision may detract from your enjoyment of day to day activities 
Uncorrected farsightedness may cause you to squint or strain your eyes to maintain focus 
This could be especially serious if you are driving a car or operating heavy equipment 
It can be frightening when your child has a febrile seizure 
SymptomsUsually, a child having a febrile seizure shakes all over and loses consciousness 
This most common type lasts from a few seconds to minutes 
Causes Usually, a higher than normal body temperature causes febrile seizures 
Post vaccination seizuresThe risk of febrile seizures may increase after some childhood vaccinations 
These include the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine and the measles mumps rubella vaccine 
A child can develop a low grade fever after a vaccination 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of having a febrile seizure include 
Some children inherit a family s tendency to have seizures with a fever 
Additionally, researchers have linked several genes to a susceptibility to febrile seizures 
Recurrent febrile seizuresThe most common complication is the possibility of more febrile seizures 
An immediate family member has a history of febrile seizures 
Your child was younger than months at the time of the first febrile seizure 
Prescription prevention medicationsRarely, prescription anticonvulsant medications are used to try to prevent febrile seizures 
However, these medications can have serious side effects that may outweigh any possible benefit 
Many infertile couples will go on to conceive a child without treatment 
SymptomsThe main symptom of infertility is the inability to get pregnant 
When to see a doctorWhen to seek help can depend on your age 
If you re older than , your doctor might suggest testing or treatment right away 
The fertilized egg travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus 
The fertilized egg attaches implants to the inside of the uterus and grows 
In women, a number of factors can disrupt this process at any step 
Female infertility is caused by one or more of the factors below 
Ovulation disordersOvulating infrequently or not at all accounts for most cases of infertility 
polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS causes a hormone imbalance, which affects ovulation 
This can also be caused by medications you re taking for another condition 
Causes of fallopian tube damage or blockage can include 
Benign polyps or tumors fibroids or myomas are common in the uterus 
Some can block fallopian tubes or interfere with implantation, affecting fertility 
However, many women who have fibroids or polyps do become pregnant 
Unexplained infertilityIn some cases, the cause of infertility is never found 
A combination of several minor factors in both partners could cause unexplained fertility problems 
Although it s frustrating to get no specific answer, this problem can correct itself with time 
Risk factors Certain factors may put you at higher risk of infertility, including 
The quality and quantity of a woman s eggs begin to decline with age 
This makes conception more difficult, and increases the risk of miscarriage 
It s also thought to age your ovaries and deplete your eggs prematurely 
Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can damage the fallopian tubes 
PreventionFor women thinking about getting pregnant soon or in the future, these tips might help 
Overweight and underweight women are at increased risk of ovulation disorders 
And any alcohol use can affect the health of a developing fetus 
If you re planning to become pregnant, avoid alcohol, and don t drink alcohol while pregnant 
Try to reduce stress in your life before trying to become pregnant 
Female sexual dysfunction can occur at any stage of life 
It can occur only in certain sexual situations or in all sexual situations 
Sexual response involves a complex interplay of physiology, emotions, experiences, beliefs, lifestyle and relationships 
SymptomsSymptoms vary depending on what type of sexual dysfunction you re experiencing 
You have pain associated with sexual stimulation or vaginal contact 
Factors often interrelated that contribute to sexual dissatisfaction or dysfunction include 
The vaginal lining also becomes thinner and less elastic, particularly if you re not sexually active 
The worries of pregnancy and demands of being a new mother may have similar effects 
Cultural and religious issues and problems with body image also can contribute 
Risk factors Some factors may increase your risk of sexual dysfunction 
Neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis 
Gynecological conditions, such as vulvovaginal atrophy, infections or lichen sclerosus 
Certain medications, such as antidepressants or high blood pressure medications 
Emotional or psychological stress, especially with regard to your relationship with your partner 
There is no amount of alcohol that s known to be safe to consume during pregnancy 
If you drink during pregnancy, you place your baby at risk of fetal alcohol syndrome 
Early diagnosis may help to reduce problems such as learning difficulties and behavioral issues 
Brain and central nervous system problemsProblems with the brain and central nervous system may include 
Social and behavioral issuesProblems in functioning, coping and interacting with others may include 
Trouble adapting to change or switching from one task to another 
Alcohol enters your bloodstream and reaches your developing fetus by crossing the placenta 
Alcohol interferes with the delivery of oxygen and optimal nutrition to your developing baby 
The more you drink while pregnant, the greater the risk to your unborn baby 
However, any amount of alcohol puts your baby at risk 
That s when these parts of the fetus are in key stages of development 
However, the risk is present at any time during pregnancy 
There s no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy 
You could put your baby at risk even before you realize you re pregnant 
Mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety or eating disorders 
Fetal alcohol syndrome is completely preventable in children whose mothers don t drink during pregnancy 
Many pregnancies are unplanned, and damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy 
If you have an alcohol problem, get help before you get pregnant 
About of babies worldwide weigh more than pounds, ounces 
Fetal macrosomia also puts the baby at increased risk of health problems after birth 
SymptomsFetal macrosomia can be difficult to detect and diagnose during pregnancy 
A larger than expected fundal height could be a sign of fetal macrosomia 
Causes Genetic factors and maternal conditions such as obesity or diabetes can cause fetal macrosomia 
Sometimes it s unknown what causes a baby to be larger than average 
Gaining too much weight during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal macrosomia 
Most babies who weigh more than pounds, ounces , grams are male 
Women older than are more likely to have a baby diagnosed with fetal macrosomia 
Newborn and childhood risksPossible complications of fetal macrosomia for your baby might include 
Research suggests that the risk of childhood obesity increases as birth weight increases 
If you re considering pregnancy, talk with your health care provider 
Women who weigh more when they get pregnant will have lower recommended pregnancy weight gain 
Work with your health care provider to determine what s right for you 
Controlling your blood sugar level is the best way to prevent complications, including fetal macrosomia 
Fever Overview A fever is a temporary rise in body temperature 
It s one part of an overall response from the body s immune system 
For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable 
For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there s a serious infection 
But you don t necessarily need to treat a fever if it s not causing discomfort 
SymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day 
The average temperature has traditionally been defined as F C 
Depending on what s causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include 
Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature 
Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements 
In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate 
Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers 
Call your baby s health care provider if your child is 
ChildrenThere s probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive 
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you 
Has a fever after being left in a hot car 
AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is F C or higher 
Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever 
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward 
Causes Typical body temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss 
Even when you re healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day 
It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening 
When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher 
This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss 
The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat 
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures 
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis DTaP , pneumococcal or COVID vaccine 
Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects 
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground 
Don t place anything in your child s mouth or try to stop the seizure 
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it s your child s first febrile seizure 
PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases 
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID 
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing 
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children 
A fibroadenoma happens most often between ages and 
But it can be found at any age in anyone who has periods 
You may need a biopsy to check the lump or surgery to remove it 
SymptomsA fibroadenoma is a solid breast lump that often causes no pain 
It may be tender or cause soreness a few days before your period 
But most often, this type of breast lump causes no pain 
You can have a single fibroadenoma or more than one fibroadenoma 
Most fibroadenomas in adolescents shrink over many months to a few years 
When to see a doctorHealthy breast tissue often feels lumpy 
Make an appointment with your health care provider if you 
They might be related to hormones that control your periods 
Giant fibroadenomas grow quickly to larger than inches centimeters 
They also can press on nearby breast tissue or push it out of place 
But under a microscope, phyllodes tumors look different from fibroadenomas 
Complications Common fibroadenomas do not affect your risk of breast cancer 
Overview Fibrocystic breasts are composed of tissue that feels lumpy or ropelike in texture 
It s not at all uncommon to have fibrocystic breasts or experience fibrocystic breast changes 
Breast symptoms tend to be most bothersome just before menstruation and get better afterward 
Simple self care measures can usually relieve discomfort associated with fibrocystic breasts 
Breast lumps or areas of thickening that tend to blend into the surrounding breast tissue 
Breast nodules or lumpy tissue change in size with the menstrual cycle 
Green or dark brown nonbloody nipple discharge that tends to leak without pressure or squeezing 
Fibrocystic breast changes occur most often between and years of age 
When to see a doctorMost fibrocystic breast changes are normal 
You have specific areas of continuous or worsening breast pain 
but now it seems to be bigger or otherwise changed 
When examined under a microscope, fibrocystic breast tissue includes distinct components such as 
Overgrowth of cells hyperplasia lining the milk ducts or milk producing tissues lobules of the breast 
Complications Having fibrocystic breasts doesn t increase your risk of breast cancer 
They often appear during the years you re usually able to get pregnant and give birth 
Uterine fibroids are not cancer, and they almost never turn into cancer 
You can have a single fibroid or more than one 
Some of these growths are too small to see with the eyes 
Others can grow to the size of a grapefruit or larger 
In extreme cases, some fibroids grow large enough to fill the pelvis or stomach area 
But you might not know you have them, because they often cause no symptoms 
SymptomsMany people who have uterine fibroids don t have any symptoms 
Pain in the stomach area or lower back, or pain during sex 
Intramural fibroids grow within the muscular wall of the uterus 
Heavy or painful periods that limit what you can do 
Many fibroids contain changes in genes that differ from those in typical uterine muscle cells 
Fibroids tend to shrink after menopause due to a drop in hormone levels 
This material makes cells stick together, like mortar between bricks 
ECM also stores growth factors and causes biologic changes in the cells themselves 
In time it turns into a firm, rubbery mass distinct from nearby tissue 
Some fibroids go through growth spurts, and some shrink on their own 
But they can cause pain, and they may lead to complications 
These include a drop in red blood cells called anemia 
But some fibroids especially the submucosal kind could cause infertility or pregnancy loss 
Fibroids also may raise the risk of certain pregnancy complications 
Fetal growth restriction, when an unborn baby doesn t grow as well as expected 
Preterm delivery, when a baby is born too early, before the th week of pregnancy 
More research is needed on how to prevent them, though 
But only a small percentage of these tumors need treatment 
You might be able to lower your fibroid risk with healthy lifestyle changes 
And eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables 
Narrowed arteries can reduce blood flow and affect how body organs work 
Fibromuscular dysplasia is most often seen in the arteries leading to the kidneys and brain 
Treatments are available to control symptoms and help prevent complications, such as stroke 
SymptomsSymptoms of fibromuscular dysplasia depend on which artery or arteries are affected 
If the arteries to the kidneys are affected, common symptoms include 
If the arteries affected supply blood to the brain, symptoms might include 
A pulsing feeling or ringing sound in your ears, called tinnitus 
Fibromuscular dysplasia is not linked to women s use of birth control pills 
Risk factors Things that increase the risk of fibromuscular dysplasia include 
The condition is more common in women than it is in men 
Fibromuscular dysplasia tends to be diagnosed in people in their s 
People who smoke seem to have an increased risk of developing fibromuscular dysplasia 
The narrowing of the arteries of the kidneys causes higher pressure on the artery walls 
Damage to the arteries may lead to heart disease or heart failure 
Fibromuscular dysplasia and tears in the walls of the arteries often occur together 
Fibromuscular dysplasia can weaken the walls of the affected arteries 
An aneurysm that breaks open, called a rupture, can be life threatening 
An artery tear or aneurysm rupture in the brain can lead to stroke 
High blood pressure also can increase the risk of a stroke 
In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event 
Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men 
While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms 
There are likely many factors that lead to these changes, including 
Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical event, such as a car accident 
Risk factors Risk factors for fibromyalgia include 
Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men 
Interstitial lung disease can be caused by long term exposure to hazardous materials, such as asbestos 
Some types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also can cause interstitial lung disease 
Lung transplant is an option for some people who have interstitial lung disease 
SymptomsThe primary signs and symptoms of interstitial lung disease are 
By the time symptoms appear, irreversible lung damage has often already occurred 
Nevertheless, it s important to see your doctor at the first sign of breathing problems 
Ordinarily, your body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage 
This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream 
Long term exposure to a number of toxins and pollutants can damage your lungs 
Nitrofurantoin Macrobid, Macrodantin, others and ethambutol Myambutol can cause lung damage 
Certain anti inflammatory drugs, such as rituximab Rituxan or sulfasalazine Azulfidine , can cause lung damage 
Lung damage can also result from autoimmune diseases such as 
The list of substances and conditions that can lead to interstitial lung disease is long 
Even so, in some cases, the causes are never found 
Risk factors Factors that may make you more susceptible to interstitial lung disease include 
Complications Interstitial lung disease can lead to a series of life threatening complications, including 
Unlike systemic high blood pressure, this condition affects only the arteries in your lungs 
Pulmonary hypertension is a serious illness that becomes progressively worse 
This thickened, stiff tissue makes it harder for the lungs to work properly 
As it gets worse, people become more and more short of breath 
The scarring that happens in pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many things 
Often, doctors and other healthcare professionals cannot pinpoint what s causing the problem 
When a cause cannot be found, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually occurs in middle aged and older adults 
Sometimes pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed in children and infants, but this is not common 
The lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis cannot be repaired 
For some people, a lung transplant might be an option 
Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes, called clubbing 
Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years 
These changes make it harder for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream 
Examples include long term exposure to certain toxins, radiation therapy, some medicines and certain medical conditions 
In some cases, the cause of pulmonary fibrosis is not known 
Antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin Macrobid, Macrodantin or ethambutol Myambutol can cause lung damage 
Certain anti inflammatory medicines such as rituximab Rituxan or sulfasalazine Azulfidine can cause lung damage 
Medical conditionsLung damage can also result from a number of conditions, including 
Dermatomyositis, an inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a skin rash 
Pneumonia, an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs 
Polymyositis, an inflammatory disease that causes muscle weakness on both sides of the body 
Rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease that affects joints and other body systems 
Sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that most often affects the lungs and lymph nodes 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosisMany substances and conditions can lead to pulmonary fibrosis 
Even so, in many people, the cause is never found 
Pulmonary fibrosis with no known cause is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
Many people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also may have gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD 
This condition occurs when acid from the stomach flows back into the esophagus 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is much more likely to affect middle aged and older adults 
Factors that can raise your risk of pulmonary fibrosis include 
Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, so genes may play a role 
Called pulmonary hypertension, this type of high blood pressure affects the arteries in the lungs 
Stiff and thick arteries may slow down or block blood flow through the lungs 
This is often the last stage of long term lung disease 
Long standing pulmonary fibrosis increases your risk of developing lung cancer 
When cancer starts in these cells it s called squamous cell carcinoma 
These changes may include a lump or a sore that doesn t heal 
Floor of the mouth cancer treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy 
All forms of tobacco increase the risk of floor of the mouth cancer 
Frequent and heavy drinking increases the risk of floor of the mouth cancer 
Using alcohol and tobacco together increases the risk even more 
Human papillomavirus, also called HPV, is a common virus that s passed through sexual contact 
For others, it causes changes in cells that can lead to many types of cancer 
PreventionTo lower the risk of floor of the mouth cancer 
Receiving a vaccination to prevent HPV infection may reduce your risk of HPV related cancers 
Most people with the flu get better on their own 
People who plan to be pregnant, are pregnant or recently gave birth during flu season 
People who live or work in facilities with many other residents 
Those groups include people who are American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or Latino 
Other groups at high risk for flu complications include people with 
Nervous system disorders or conditions that change how the brain processes information 
And people with certain medical conditions have a higher risk of flu complications, such as 
People who are younger than years of age and receiving long term aspirin therapy 
This is especially true for people who are at high risk for flu complications 
And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu 
But they are more common in children than in adults 
If you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away 
Emergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as 
Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time 
Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often 
And antibodies against past influenza viruses may not protect you from new influenza strains 
New strains can be very different from what you had before 
Adults older than age also tend to have worse outcomes 
People who are staying in the hospital also are at higher risk 
This risk continues up to two weeks after the baby is born 
Complications If you re young and healthy, the flu usually isn t serious 
But children and adults at high risk may develop complications that may include 
For older adults and people with chronic illnesses, pneumonia can be deadly 
The flu vaccine can lower your risk of getting the flu 
The flu vaccine also lowers your risk of dying of flu 
Both COVID and the flu may be spreading at the same time 
This year, the vaccine will be available as an injection and as a nasal spray 
There also will be high dose flu vaccines offered for adults age and older 
The nasal spray is approved for people between ages and years old 
People who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past 
Children age years or younger who are taking aspirin or a salicylate containing medicine 
If you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine 
By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection 
Overview The H N flu, sometimes called swine flu, is a type of influenza A virus 
During the flu season, a new H N virus began causing illness in humans 
The World Health Organization WHO declared the H N flu to be a pandemic in 
That year the virus caused an estimated , deaths worldwide 
But flu and its complications can be deadly, especially for people at high risk 
Feeling sick to the stomach, vomiting, but this is more common in children than adults 
Flu symptoms develop about to days after you re exposed to the virus 
But some people are at higher risk of flu complications 
Some examples are asthma, emphysema, diabetes or a heart condition 
Pale, gray or blue colored skin, lips or nail beds depending on skin color 
The virus enters your body when you breathe in contaminated droplets 
Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, and nervous system diseases 
Other examples are metabolic disorders, problems with an airway and kidney, liver or blood disease 
American Indians or Alaska Native people may have a higher risk of influenza complications 
Worsening of chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma 
The H N virus is included in the seasonal flu vaccine 
Each year s seasonal flu vaccine protects against the three or four influenza viruses 
These are the viruses expected to be the most common during that year s flu season 
Flu vaccination could lessen symptoms that might be confused with those caused by COVID 
Vaccination also helps lower the number of people with severe flu and complications 
And that may lower the number of people needing to stay in the hospital 
The flu vaccine is available as an injection and as a nasal spray 
The nasal spray is approved for people between and years old 
Children between and years old who are taking aspirin or a salicylate containing medication 
Close contacts or caregivers of people with highly weakened immune systems 
Examples are people receiving chemotherapy, or recent bone marrow or solid organ transplantation 
If you have an egg allergy you can still get a flu vaccine 
These measures also help prevent the flu and limit its spread 
If available, use soap and water, washing for at least seconds 
Or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that has at least alcohol 
Try to avoid people who are sick or have symptoms of flu 
And if you have symptoms, stay home if you can 
Pericardial effusion can put pressure on the heart, affecting how the heart works 
If untreated, it may lead to heart failure or death in extreme cases 
If pericardial effusion signs and symptoms do occur, they might include 
Chest pain, usually behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest 
See your health care provider if you have shortness of breath 
In some settings, large effusions may be caused by certain cancers 
Spread of cancer metastasis , particularly lung cancer, breast cancer or Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Radiation therapy for cancer if the heart was in the area of the radiation 
Waste products in the blood due to kidney failure uremia 
Complications A potential complication of pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade tam pon AYD 
In this condition, the excess fluid within the pericardium puts pressure on the heart 
The strain prevents the heart chambers from filling completely with blood 
Cardiac tamponade results in poor blood flow and a lack of oxygen to the body 
Treatment options for FSGS depend on the type you have 
Many people diagnosed with FSGS have no known cause for their condition 
This is a rare form of FSGS caused by genetic changes 
It s suspected when several members of a family show signs of FSGS 
Infections and damage from illicit drugs, medicines or toxins also can cause it 
Risk factors Factors that can raise the risk of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis FSGS include 
Certain diseases and conditions increase the risk of getting FSGS 
Infections that increase the risk of FSGS include HIV and hepatitis C 
Certain genes passed through families can raise the risk of FSGS 
Complications Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis FSGS may lead to other health concerns, also called complications, including 
This kidney condition causes the body to pass too much protein in the urine 
Damage to the kidneys that can t be fixed causes the kidneys to stop working 
The only treatments for kidney failure are dialysis or kidney transplant 
The causes are germs or other harmful things in the food or beverage 
Symptoms of food poisoning often include upset stomach, diarrhea and vomiting 
Symptoms usually start within hours or several days of eating the food 
Most people have mild illness and get better without treatment 
They may begin within a few hours or a few weeks depending on the cause 
Less often food poisoning affects the nervous system and can cause severe disease 
Fever of degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius or higher in older children 
Adults should see a health care provider or get emergency care if the following occur 
Nervous system symptoms, such as blurry vision, muscle weakness and tingling of skin 
Causes Many germs or harmful things, called contaminants, can cause foodborne illnesses 
Food or drink that carries a contaminant is called contaminated 
Understanding termsThe term food poisoning is commonly used to describe all foodborne illnesses 
A health care provider might use these terms to be more specific 
Foodborne illnesses means all illnesses from any contaminated food or beverage 
Food poisoning means illness specifically from a toxin in food 
The problem can begin during growing, harvesting or catching, processing, storing, shipping, or preparing 
Food can be contaminated any place it s handled, including the home, because of 
Feces that remains on the hands after using the toilet can contaminate food 
Other contaminants can be transferred from hands during food preparation or food serving 
Unwashed knives, cutting boards or other kitchen tools can spread contaminants 
Food left out for too long at room temperature can become contaminated 
Food stored in the refrigerator for too long can spoil 
Also, food stored in a refrigerator or freezer that is too warm can spoil 
Raw or undercooked poultry, shellfish, unpasteurized milk, and contaminated water 
Home preserved foods including canned foods, fermented fish, fermented beans and alcohol 
Commonly, food that is not kept hot enough when served to a large group 
Food and water contaminated with feces that carry the parasite 
Raw and undercooked shellfish, fresh fruits and vegetables, and other uncooked food 
Ready to eat foods, such as salads and sandwiches, touched by food handlers with the virus 
Food or water contaminated with vomit or feces of a person with the virus 
Food, water or objects, such as faucet handles or utensils, contaminated with the virus 
Other foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, poultry, nuts, nut products, and spices 
Shellfish, including cooked shellfish, from coastal seawater contaminated with toxins 
Often ready to eat food handled by a food worker with shigella 
Foods handled by a person with the bacteria, which is often found on skin 
Some people are more likely to get sick or have more serious disease or complications 
People with weakened immune systems due to another disease or treatments 
This a severe loss of water and salts and minerals 
Most healthy adults can drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration 
Severe dehydration can cause organ damage, other severe disease and death if not treated 
E coli can result in blood clots that block the kidneys filtering system 
Less often, other bacteria or viruses may cause this condition 
Pregnancy complicationsIllness from the listeria bacteria during pregnancy can result in 
Rare complicationsRare complications include conditions that may develop after food poisoning, including 
Rarely, botulism can damage nerves that control the muscles involved in breathing 
Wash your hands with soap and water for at least seconds 
Do this after using the toilet, before eating, and before and after handling food 
Rinse fruits and vegetables under running water before eating, peeling or preparing 
Use a meat thermometer to make sure meat is cooked enough 
Cook ground meat to at least F C 
Cook whole and ground poultry to at least F C 
Put leftovers in covered containers in the refrigerator right after your meal 
Leftovers can be kept for to days in the refrigerator 
If you don t think you ll eat them within four days, freeze them right away 
You can move it to the refrigerator to thaw overnight 
Reheat leftovers until the internal temperature reaches degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius 
Even if it looks and smells fine, it may not be safe to eat 
Throw out moldy soft fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, berries or peaches 
And throw away any nuts or nut products with mold 
Cut away at least inch centimeters around the moldy part of the food 
Clean visible mold in the refrigerator or on the door seals 
Raw sprouts, such as alfalfa, bean, clover and radish sprouts 
Soft cheeses, such as feta, brie and Camembert blue veined cheese and unpasteurized cheese 
Patent foramen ovale Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The hole is a small flaplike opening between the upper heart chambers 
The upper chambers of the heart are called the atria 
When the foramen ovale doesn t close, it s called a patent foramen ovale 
SymptomsPatent foramen ovale occurs in about in people 
Most people with the condition never know they have it 
A patent foramen ovale is often discovered during tests for other health problems 
Causes It s unclear why the foramen ovale stays open in some people 
It pumps blood to the right lower heart chamber through the tricuspid valve 
This heart chamber receives the oxygen rich blood from the lungs 
The blood passes through the aortic valve, which also closes when the chamber relaxes 
That means there s no need to pump blood to the lungs 
In the baby s body, blood vessels connect to the umbilical cord 
The blood then goes across the foramen ovale and into the left upper heart chamber 
Finally, the blood enters the left lower heart chamber, which pumps it throughout the body 
Newborn baby s heartWhen a baby s lungs begin working, blood flow through the heart changes 
Now the oxygen rich blood comes from the lungs and enters the left upper heart chamber 
Sometimes small blood clots in veins may travel to the heart 
It s often just a coincidence a person also has a PFO 
With proper treatment, most growth plate fractures heal without complications 
SymptomsMost growth plate fractures occur in bones of the fingers, forearm and lower leg 
Signs and symptoms of a growth plate fracture may include 
Pain and tenderness, particularly in response to pressure on the growth plate 
Inability to move the affected area or to put weight or pressure on the limb 
Warmth and swelling at the end of a bone, near a joint 
If you suspect a fracture, take your child to be examined by a doctor 
Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, running, dancing or gymnastics 
But the following factors can increase the risk of crooked, accelerated or stunted bone growth 
The growth plates around the knee are more sensitive to injury 
Growth plate injuries around the wrist and shoulder usually heal without problems 
Stress fractures Overview Stress fractures are tiny cracks in a bone 
Stress fractures are most common in the weight bearing bones of the lower leg and foot 
The tenderness usually starts at a specific spot and decreases during rest 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of stress fractures include 
Having had one or more stress fractures puts you at higher risk of having more 
Complications Some stress fractures don t heal properly, which can cause chronic problems 
Avoid increasing the amount you exercise by more than a week 
Make sure your shoes fit well and are appropriate for your activity 
If you have flat feet, ask your doctor about arch supports for your shoes 
Overview Frostbite is an injury caused by freezing of the skin and underlying tissues 
You may not realize you have frostbite until someone else points it out 
Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin 
Continued cold exposure leads to numbness in the affected area 
As your skin warms, you may feel pain and tingling 
The skin may begin to feel warm a sign of serious skin involvement 
A fluid filled blister may appear to hours after rewarming the skin 
and you lose all sensation of cold, pain or discomfort in the area 
When to see a doctorSeek medical attention for frostbite if you experience 
Increased pain, swelling, inflammation or discharge in the area that was frostbitten 
Wrap the person with hypothermia in warm blankets until help arrives 
The most common cause of frostbite is exposure to cold weather conditions 
Risk factors The following factors increase the risk of frostbite 
Growth problems in children, if frostbite damages a bone s growth plate 
Here are tips to help you stay safe and warm 
In very cold, windy weather, exposed skin can develop frostbite in a matter of minutes 
Air trapped between the layers of clothing acts as insulation against the cold 
Wear windproof and waterproof outer garments to protect against wind, snow and rain 
Wear a hat or headband that fully covers the ears 
Heavy woolen or windproof materials make the best headwear for cold protection 
Wear socks and sock liners that fit well, wick moisture and provide insulation 
Be sure foot warmers don t make boots too tight, restricting blood flow 
Early signs of frostbite include changes in skin color, prickling and numbness 
If you ll be in remote territory, tell others your route and expected return date 
Don t drink alcohol if you plan to be outdoors in cold weather 
Doing this even before you go out in the cold will help you stay warm 
This can lead to glare, blurred or cloudy vision, and eye discomfort 
Some medications and self care steps may help relieve your Fuchs dystrophy signs and symptoms 
SymptomsAs the disease progresses, Fuchs dystrophy symptoms, which usually affect both eyes, might include 
Blurred or cloudy vision, sometimes described as a general lack of clarity of vision 
As the disease progresses, blurred vision either can take longer to improve or doesn t improve 
Glare, which can decrease your vision in dim and bright light 
Pain or grittiness from tiny blisters on the surface of your cornea 
Other eye conditions that cause the same symptoms as Fuchs dystrophy also require prompt treatment 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing Fuchs dystrophy include 
Fuchs dystrophy is more common in women than in men 
Having a family history of Fuchs dystrophy increases your risk 
It is a constant condition but symptoms don t happen all the time 
They include pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen, bloating, belching and nausea 
Pain or burning in the stomach, bloating, excessive belching, or nausea after eating 
Stomach pain that occurs unrelated to meals or goes away when eating 
Risk factors Some factors can increase the risk of functional dyspepsia 
Using certain pain relievers that are available without a prescription 
These include aspirin and ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others , which can cause stomach problems 
Overview Nail fungus is a common infection of the nail 
If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment 
But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back 
SymptomsSymptoms of nail fungus include a nail or nails that are 
Nail fungus can affect fingernails, but it s more common in toenails 
Also talk with your health care provider if you have 
Causes Nail fungus is caused by various fungal organisms fungi 
The discoloration from a bacterial infection tends to be green or black 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of developing nail fungus include 
Walking barefoot in damp public areas, such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms 
Having a skin condition that affects the nails, such as psoriasis 
Having diabetes, blood flow problems or a weakened immune system 
Dry well, apply an antifungal foot powder and moisturize your nails 
Consider applying a nail hardener, which might help strengthen nails and cuticles 
Cut nails straight across, smooth the edges with a file and file down thickened areas 
Letting your nails grow long creates more places for the fungus to grow 
Wear absorbent socks or change your socks throughout the day 
Discard old shoes or treat them with disinfectants or antifungal powders 
Choose a nail salon that uses sterilized manicure tools for each customer 
If you have athlete s foot, treat it with an antifungal product 
Also called funnel chest, pectus excavatum is more common in boys than in girls 
But even mild cases of pectus excavatum can make children feel self conscious about their appearance 
In severe cases of pectus excavatum, the breastbone may compress the lungs and heart 
Risk factors Pectus excavatum is more common in boys than in girls 
It also occurs more often in people who also have 
Even mild cases of pectus excavatum can result in self image problems 
Galactorrhea itself isn t a disease, but it could be a sign of another medical condition 
Often, galactorrhea results from increased levels of prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production 
Milky nipple discharge that may be constant, or it may come and go 
It may be a sign of an underlying breast cancer 
Causes Galactorrhea often results from having too much prolactin in the body 
Prolactin is the hormone responsible for milk production after a baby is born 
Medicines, such as certain sedatives, antidepressants, antipsychotics and high blood pressure drugs 
A noncancerous pituitary tumor, called prolactinoma, or other conditions of the pituitary gland 
Nerve damage to the chest wall from chest surgery, burns or other chest injuries 
Idiopathic galactorrheaSometimes healthcare professionals can t find a cause for galactorrhea 
If you have increased sensitivity to prolactin, even normal prolactin levels can lead to galactorrhea 
Galactorrhea in menIn males, galactorrhea may be associated with testosterone deficiency, called male hypogonadism 
This usually happens along with breast enlargement or tenderness, called gynecomastia 
Erectile dysfunction and a lack of sexual desire also are associated with testosterone deficiency 
High maternal estrogen levels cross the placenta into the baby s blood 
This milky discharge is temporary and goes away on its own 
If the discharge is persistent, the newborn should be evaluated by a healthcare professional 
Conditions that affect the pituitary gland, such as noncancerous pituitary tumors 
Gallstones Overview Gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in your gallbladder 
The gallbladder holds a digestive fluid called bile that s released into your small intestine 
Some people develop just one gallstone, while others develop many gallstones at the same time 
People who experience symptoms from their gallstones usually require gallbladder removal surgery 
Gallstones that don t cause any signs and symptoms typically don t need treatment 
Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right portion of your abdomen 
Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the center of your abdomen, just below your breastbone 
Gallstone pain may last several minutes to a few hours 
Abdominal pain so intense that you can t sit still or find a comfortable position 
Normally, your bile contains enough chemicals to dissolve the cholesterol excreted by your liver 
Bilirubin is a chemical that s produced when your body breaks down red blood cells 
Types of gallstonesTypes of gallstones that can form in the gallbladder include 
The most common type of gallstone, called a cholesterol gallstone, often appears yellow in color 
These gallstones are composed mainly of undissolved cholesterol, but may contain other components 
These dark brown or black stones form when your bile contains too much bilirubin 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of gallstones include 
Having certain blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or leukemia 
Taking medications that contain estrogen, such as oral contraceptives or hormone therapy drugs 
Pancreatic juices, which aid in digestion, flow through the pancreatic duct 
Pancreatitis causes intense, constant abdominal pain and usually requires hospitalization 
People with a history of gallstones have an increased risk of gallbladder cancer 
Skipping meals or fasting can increase the risk of gallstones 
Aim to lose or pounds about to kilogram a week 
Include more fiber rich foods in your diet, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
Gangrene commonly affects the arms and legs, including the toes and fingers 
The earlier gangrene is identified and treated, the better the chances for recovery 
SymptomsWhen gangrene affects the skin, signs and symptoms may include 
Fever, although some people may have a body temperature lower than F C 
When to see a doctorGangrene is a serious condition and needs emergency treatment 
Skin changes including discoloration, warmth, swelling, blisters or lesions that won t go away 
Sudden pain at the site of a recent surgery or trauma 
It also provides the immune system with antibodies to fight infections 
Without a proper blood supply, cells can t survive, and tissue dies 
If the bacteria infect tissues and remain untreated, gangrene can occur 
Gangrene is referred to as wet if bacteria have infected the tissue 
Swelling, blistering and a wet appearance are common features of wet gangrene 
Wet gangrene may develop after a severe burn, frostbite or injury 
It often occurs in people with diabetes who unknowingly injure a toe or foot 
Wet gangrene needs to be treated immediately because it spreads quickly and can be deadly 
The surface of your skin may look normal at first 
Gas gangrene is most commonly caused by bacteria called Clostridium perfringens 
Bacteria gather in an injury or surgical wound that has no blood supply 
The bacterial infection produces toxins that release gas and cause tissue death 
It occurs when blood flow to an internal organ is blocked 
It usually affects men, but women also can get it 
An infection in the genital area or urinary tract causes this type of gangrene 
Painful skin lesions typically occur one to two weeks after a surgery 
Another name for this condition is progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene 
Risk factors Things that can increase the risk of gangrene include 
Blood vessel damage can slow or block blood flow to a part of the body 
Rarely, injectable drugs have been linked to infection with bacteria that cause gangrene 
Complications Gangrene can lead to serious complications if it s not immediately treated 
You may need to have a body part removed amputated to save your life 
Removal of infected tissue can lead to scarring or the need for reconstructive surgery 
PreventionHere are a few ways to help reduce the risk of developing gangrene 
If you have diabetes, it s important to control your blood sugar levels 
The weight also puts pressure on the arteries, slowing blood flow 
Decreased blood flow increases infection risk and causes slow wound healing 
Wash any open wounds with a mild soap and water 
Gas and gas pains Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Getting rid of excess gas, either by burping or passing gas flatus , also is normal 
Often, relatively simple changes in eating habits can lessen bothersome gas 
A feeling of fullness or pressure in your abdomen bloating 
An observable increase in the size of your abdomen distention 
Burping is normal, particularly during or right after a meal 
Most people pass gas up to times a day 
Gas or gas pains accompanied by other signs or symptoms may indicate more serious conditions 
See your doctor if you experience any of these additional signs or symptoms 
Common foods that cause gasCertain high fiber foods may cause gas, including 
Carbonated beverages, such as soda and beer, increase stomach gas 
Fiber supplements containing psyllium, such as Metamucil, may increase colon gas 
Medical conditionsMedical conditions that may increase intestinal gas, bloating or gas pain include the following 
Gastritis may occur suddenly acute gastritis or appear slowly over time chronic gastritis 
In some cases, gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer 
For most people, however, gastritis isn t serious and improves quickly with treatment 
Gnawing or burning ache or pain, called indigestion, in your upper belly 
This feeling may become either worse or better after eating 
A feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating 
When to see a doctorNearly everyone has had indigestion and stomach irritation at some point 
Usually, indigestion doesn t last long and doesn t require medical care 
See your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of gastritis for a week or longer 
Also seek attention right away if you feel lightheaded or dizzy 
The stomach lining is a mucus lined barrier that protects the stomach wall 
Several diseases and conditions can increase the risk of gastritis 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of gastritis include 
However, only some people with the infection develop gastritis or other upper gastrointestinal disorders 
Healthcare professionals believe sensitivity to the germs could be inherited 
Sensitivity also may be caused by lifestyle choices, such as smoking and diet 
NSAIDs include ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others and naproxen sodium Aleve, Anaprox DS 
Excessive alcohol use is more likely to cause acute gastritis 
Severe stress due to major surgery, injury, burns or severe infections can cause acute gastritis 
Chemotherapy medicines or radiation treatment can increase your risk of gastritis 
This reaction can wear away at your stomach s protective barrier 
Autoimmune gastritis is more common in people with other autoimmune disorders 
Autoimmune gastritis also can be associated with vitamin B deficiency 
These may include HIV AIDS, Crohn s disease, celiac disease, sarcoidosis and parasitic infections 
Complications Left untreated, gastritis may lead to stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding 
Rarely, some forms of chronic gastritis may increase your risk of stomach cancer 
Tell your healthcare professional if your symptoms aren t improving despite treatment for gastritis 
Viral gastroenteritis stomach flu Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
There s no effective treatment for viral gastroenteritis, so prevention is key 
Avoid food and water that may be contaminated and wash your hands thoroughly and often 
SymptomsAlthough it s commonly called stomach flu, gastroenteritis isn t the same as influenza 
The flu influenza affects only your respiratory system your nose, throat and lungs 
Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, attacks your intestines, causing signs and symptoms such as 
When to see a doctorIf you re an adult, call your health care provider if 
You re not able to keep liquids down for hours 
You ve been vomiting or having diarrhea for more than two days 
For infants and childrenSee your child s health care provider right away if your child 
Has a fever of F C or higher 
Babies vomit for a variety of reasons, many of which may require medical attention 
Has a sunken soft spot fontanel on the top of his or her head 
It s especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces 
In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water 
The infection is most severe in infants and young children 
Adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms, but can still spread the illness 
Some shellfish, especially raw or undercooked oysters, also can make you sick 
Adult immune systems tend to become less efficient later in life 
Older adults in nursing homes are vulnerable because their immune systems weaken 
They also live in close contact with others who may pass along germs 
Each gastrointestinal virus has a season when it s most active 
PreventionThe best way to prevent the spread of intestinal infections is to follow these precautions 
Wash your hands after changing diapers and before preparing or eating food, too 
Wash around cuticles, beneath fingernails and in the creases of the hands 
Carry sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer for times when soap and water aren t available 
Avoid close contact with anyone who has the virus, if possible 
Avoid touching laundry that may have been exposed to a virus 
If someone in your home has viral gastroenteritis, wear gloves while touching laundry 
Wash clothing and bedding in hot water and dry them on the hottest setting 
Make sure the center has separate rooms for changing diapers and preparing or serving food 
You may be able to reduce your risk by following these tips 
Avoid ice cubes because they may be made from contaminated water 
Overview Gastrointestinal GI bleeding is a sign of a disorder in the digestive tract 
The blood often shows up in stool or vomit but isn t always obvious 
Bleeding can range from mild to severe and can be life threatening 
Imaging technology or an endoscopic investigation can usually locate the cause of the bleeding 
Treatment depends on the where the bleeding is located and how severe it is 
Changes in mental status or behavior, such as anxiousness or agitation 
If you notice any symptoms of GI bleeding, make an appointment with your doctor 
Causes Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen either in the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract 
Upper GI bleeding Causes of upper GI bleeding can include 
This is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding 
Known as Mallory Weiss tears, they can cause a lot of bleeding 
This inflammation of the esophagus is most often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD 
At times abnormal blood vessels, small bleeding arteries and veins may lead to bleeding 
Large hiatal hernias may be associated with erosions in the stomach, leading to bleeding 
This involves the development of small, bulging pouches in the digestive tract, called diverticulosis 
If one or more of the pouches become inflamed or infected, it s called diverticulitis 
This includes ulcerative colitis, which causes swollen tissues and sores in the colon and rectum 
Inflammation of the lining of the rectum can cause rectal bleeding 
Small clumps of cells that form on the lining of your colon can cause bleeding 
Most are harmless, but some might be cancerous or can become cancerous if not removed 
These are swollen veins in your anus or lower rectum, such as varicose veins 
If you have GERD, follow your health care team s instructions for treating it 
GISTs happen most often in the stomach and small intestine 
These special nerve cells are in the walls of the digestive organs 
They play a part in the process that moves food through the body 
As a GIST grows, it can cause signs and symptoms 
Feeling full if you eat only a small amount of food 
A small number are caused by genes passed from parents to children 
Your provider may also check for a growth in your abdomen 
Imaging tests help your health care team find your tumor and see its size 
Tests might include ultrasound, CT, MRI and positron emission tomography PET scans 
This test uses a long, thin tube endoscope with a light on the end 
The tube goes through the mouth and down the throat 
The needle collects small amounts of tissue for the lab tests 
Sometimes the needle can t get enough cells, or the results aren t clear 
The biopsy sample from your tumor goes to a lab for testing 
In the lab, specialists test the cells to see if they re cancer cells 
Which treatments are best for you depends on your situation 
Very small GISTs that don t cause symptoms might not need treatment 
Instead, you might have tests to see if the cancer grows 
SurgeryThe goal of surgery is to remove all the GIST 
If this happens, your first treatment might be targeted drug therapy to shrink the tumor 
The type of operation you have depends on your cancer 
Often surgeons can access the GIST using minimally invasive surgery 
Targeted drug therapyTargeted drug treatments focus on specific chemicals present within cancer cells 
Targeted drug therapy for GISTs often begins with imatinib Gleevec 
After surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back 
Before surgery to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove 
As the first treatment if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body 
This causes these organs to enlarge and can affect their function 
If the bone marrow is affected, it can interfere with your blood s ability to clot 
Siblings, even identical twins, with the disease can have different levels of severity 
Some people who have Gaucher disease have only mild or no symptoms 
Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems 
Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures 
A decrease in healthy red blood cells anemia can result in severe fatigue 
Causes Gaucher disease is passed along in an inheritance pattern called autosomal recessive 
Transgender and gender diverse people might experience gender dysphoria at some point in their lives 
The term focuses on discomfort as the problem, rather than identity 
The difference is shown by at least two of the following 
In young adolescents, a difference between gender identity and anticipated secondary sex characteristics 
A strong desire to have the genitals and secondary sex characteristics of another gender 
A strong desire to be or to be treated as another gender 
A strong belief of having the typical feelings and reactions of another gender 
Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood 
Or you might have periods in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria 
Complications Gender dysphoria can affect many aspects of life, including daily activities 
Anxiety, depression, self harm, eating disorders, substance misuse and other problems can occur 
People who have gender dysphoria also often experience discrimination, resulting in stress 
Overview Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection STI 
Genital herpes can often be spread by skin to skin contact during sexual activity 
Some people infected with the virus may have very mild symptoms or no symptoms 
Other people have pain, itching and sores around the genitals, anus or mouth 
Condoms can help prevent the spread of a genital herpes infection 
SymptomsMost people infected with HSV don t know they have it 
They may have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms 
Symptoms start about to days after exposure to the virus 
Small bumps or blisters around the genitals, anus or mouth 
Painful ulcers that form when blisters rupture and ooze or bleed 
Discharge from the urethra, the tube that releases urine from the body 
During the first outbreak, you may commonly have flu like symptoms such as 
Differences in symptom locationSores appear where the infection enters the body 
Repeat outbreaksAfter the first outbreak of genital herpes, symptoms often appear again 
You ll usually have the most outbreaks the first year after infection 
You may have warning signs a few hours or days before a new outbreak starts 
Tingling or shooting pain in the legs, hips or buttocks 
Causes Genital herpes is caused by two types of herpes simplex virus 
The moist lining or fluids of the vagina or rectum 
The virus moves from one person to another during sexual activity 
HSV HSV is a version of the virus that causes cold sores or fever blisters 
But kissing or sharing a drinking glass or silverware might spread the virus 
Risk factors A higher risk of getting genital herpes is linked to 
Having sexual contact without using a barrier increases your risk of genital herpes 
Barriers include condoms and condom like protectors called dental dams used during oral sex 
The virus can spread more easily from men to women than from women to men 
The number of people you have sex with is a strong risk factor 
Contact with genitals through sex or sexual activity puts you at higher risk 
Most people with genital herpes do not know they have it 
Having a partner who has the disease but is not taking medicine to treat it 
There is no cure for genital herpes, but medicine can help limit outbreaks 
Complications Complications associated with genital herpes may include 
Having genital sores raises your risk of giving or getting other STIs, including HIV AIDS 
Less often, the virus is passed during pregnancy or by close contact after delivery 
Newborns with HSV often have infections of internal organs or the nervous system 
HSV infection of the eye can cause pain, sores, blurred vision and blindness 
Rarely, HSV infection leads to inflammation and swelling of the brain, also called encephalitis 
Rarely, HSV in the bloodstream can cause infections of internal organs 
PreventionPrevention of genital herpes is the same as preventing other sexually transmitted infections 
Have one long term sexual partner who has been tested for STIs and isn t infected 
These reduce the risk of disease, but they don t prevent all skin to skin contact during sex 
Don t have sex when a partner with genital herpes has symptoms 
Your provider may recommend that you take herpes antiviral medicines late in pregnancy 
This is to try to prevent an outbreak around the time of delivery 
That is a surgery to remove the baby from your uterus 
It lowers the risk of passing the virus to your baby 
Overview Germ cell tumors are growths of cells that form from reproductive cells 
Most germ cell tumors occur in the testicles or the ovaries 
Rubella Overview Rubella is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash 
This infection may cause mild or no symptoms in most people 
However, it can cause serious problems for unborn babies whose mothers become infected during pregnancy 
The measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing rubella 
In many countries, rubella infection is rare or even nonexistent 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms of rubella are often difficult to notice, especially in children 
Signs and symptoms generally appear between two and three weeks after exposure to the virus 
They usually last about to days and may include 
Rubella during pregnancy is the most common cause of congenital deafness 
If you re pregnant, you ll likely undergo a routine screening for immunity to rubella 
Causes Rubella is caused by a virus that s passed from person to person 
It can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes 
It can also spread by direct contact with infected mucus from the nose and throat 
In some parts of the world, the virus is still active 
This is something to consider before going abroad, especially if you re pregnant 
In rare cases, rubella can cause an ear infection or inflammation of the brain 
Problems with the development of the heart congenital heart defects 
PreventionThe rubella vaccine is usually given as a combined measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine 
This vaccine may also include the chickenpox varicella vaccine MMRV vaccine 
The MMR vaccine prevents rubella and protects against it for life 
The combination vaccine is as safe and effective as the vaccines given separately 
But this coincidence in timing shouldn t be mistaken for a cause and effect relationship 
Do you need the MMR vaccine You don t need a vaccine if you 
Had two doses of the MMR vaccine after months of age 
Have blood tests that show you re immune to measles, mumps and rubella 
However, without a blood test that shows immunity, the MMR vaccine is recommended 
Work in a hospital, medical facility, child care center or school 
Pregnant women or women who plan to get pregnant within the next four weeks 
Side effects of the vaccineMost people experience no side effects from the vaccine 
If your child has rubella, let the school or child care provider know 
Giardia infection giardiasis Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Giardia infection can be spread through food and person to person contact 
But you may have intestinal problems long after the parasites are gone 
Several drugs are generally effective against giardia parasites, but not everyone responds to them 
Watery, sometimes foul smelling diarrhea that may alternate with soft, greasy stools 
Causes Giardia parasites live in the intestines of people and animals 
Once inside a host, the cysts dissolve and the parasites are released 
This can occur by swallowing unsafe water, by eating infected food or through person to person contact 
Children in diapers and people with diarrhea may accidentally contaminate pools and spas 
Risk factors The giardia parasite is a very common intestinal parasite 
Although anyone can pick up giardia parasites, some people are especially at risk 
Giardia infection is far more common in children than it is in adults 
Giardia infection is rampant wherever sanitation is inadequate or water isn t safe to drink 
Complications Giardia infection is almost never fatal in industrialized countries 
But it can cause lingering symptoms and serious complications, especially in infants and children 
The problem may persist long after the infection has cleared 
This is the simplest and best way to prevent most kinds of infection 
When soap and water aren t available, you can use alcohol based sanitizers 
Wash any raw fruits and vegetables with safe, uncontaminated water 
Try not to swallow water when swimming in pools, lakes or streams 
If you engage in anal sex, use a condom every time 
Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of red blood cells 
In people with Gilbert syndrome, bilirubin levels may increase due to 
Causes Gilbert syndrome is caused by a modified gene you inherit from your parents 
This gene usually controls an enzyme that helps break down bilirubin in your liver 
The bilirubin passes from the liver into the intestines with bile 
In most cases, two modified copies are needed to cause Gilbert syndrome 
Both your parents carry the modified gene that causes the disorder 
Some protease inhibitors used to treat human immunodeficiency virus HIV 
If you have Gilbert syndrome, talk to your health care provider before taking new medications 
Overview Gingivitis is a common and mild form of gum disease, also called periodontal disease 
It s important to take gingivitis seriously and treat it promptly 
Bright red or dark red gums, or gums that are darker than usual 
Your dentist may want you to see a periodontist if your symptoms aren t improving 
Plaque needs to be removed every day because it forms quickly 
Plaque that stays on your teeth can harden under your gumline into tartar 
The gingiva is the part of your gum around the base of your teeth 
If not treated, gingivitis can lead to tooth decay, periodontitis and tooth loss 
Risk factors Gingivitis is common, and anyone can develop it 
Conditions that lower immunity, such as leukemia, HIV AIDS or cancer treatment 
This is a much more serious condition that can lead to tooth loss 
Better yet, brush after every meal or snack or as your dentist recommends 
Flossing before you brush cleans away loosened food particles and bacteria 
See your dentist or dental hygienist regularly for cleanings, usually every to months 
Overview Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve 
Damage to the optic nerve is often related to high pressure in your eye 
Glaucoma can occur at any age but is more common in older adults 
It s important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure 
If glaucoma is recognized early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented 
If you have glaucoma, you ll need treatment or monitoring for the rest of your life 
SymptomsThe symptoms of glaucoma depend on the type and stage of your condition 
In later stages, difficulty seeing things in your central vision 
Go to an emergency room or call an eye doctor s ophthalmologist s office immediately 
As this nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in your vision 
The cornea is important to vision because it lets light into the eye 
The drainage angle formed by the iris and cornea remains open 
But other parts of the drainage system don t drain properly 
This may lead to a slow, gradual increase in eye pressure 
Angle closure glaucomaThis form of glaucoma occurs when the iris bulges 
The bulging iris partially or completely blocks the drainage angle 
As a result, fluid can t circulate through the eye and pressure increases 
The optic nerve may be sensitive or experience less blood flow 
The buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries also is known as atherosclerosis 
Blocked drainage, injury or an underlying medical condition may cause optic nerve damage 
Activities such as jogging sometimes stir up the pigment granules 
Risk factors Glaucoma can damage vision before you notice any symptoms 
Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, migraines, high blood pressure and sickle cell anemia 
Taking corticosteroid medicines, especially eye drops, for a long time 
Some people have narrow drainage angles, putting them at increased risk of angle closure glaucoma 
PreventionThese steps may help detect and manage glaucoma in its early stages 
That may help to prevent vision loss or slow its progress 
If you re at risk of glaucoma, you ll need more frequent screening 
Ask your health care provider to recommend the right screening schedule for you 
If you re at increased risk, you may need more frequent screening 
Wear eye protection when using power tools or playing sports 
It grows quickly and can invade and destroy healthy tissue 
Glioblastoma forms from cells called astrocytes that support nerve cells 
But it tends to occur more often in older adults and more often in men 
There s no cure for glioblastoma, which is also known as glioblastoma multiforme 
This type of exam checks vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes 
Imaging tests can help find the location and size of a glioblastoma 
Other imaging tests might include CT and positron emission tomography PET 
A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing 
Tests can tell whether the cells are cancerous and if they re glioblastoma cells 
The team uses this information to create a treatment plan 
The machine directs radiation to certain points in your brain 
For people who can t have surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be the main treatment 
Sometimes thin, circular wafers containing chemotherapy medicine might be put in the brain during surgery 
The wafers dissolve slowly, releasing the medicine to kill cancer cells 
TTF uses an electrical field to disrupt the cancer cells ability to multiply 
The pads are connected to a portable device that creates an electrical field 
Targeted therapy uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells 
There are ongoing studies of many other treatments for glioblastoma 
Overview Glioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord 
The cells in a glioma look similar to healthy brain cells called glial cells 
As a glioma grows it forms a mass of cells called a tumor 
The tumor can grow to press on brain or spinal cord tissue and cause symptoms 
Symptoms depend on which part of the brain or spinal cord is affected 
Malignant gliomas grow quickly and can invade healthy brain tissue 
In general, glioma treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and others 
Headache, particularly one that hurts the most in the morning 
Confusion or a decline in brain function, such as problems with thinking and understanding information 
Vision problems, such as blurred vision, double vision or loss of peripheral vision 
It starts when cells in the brain or spinal cord develop changes in their DNA 
The DNA changes tell the cells to make more cells quickly 
Some gliomas develop more changes in their DNA that cause them to become brain cancers 
The changes tell the cells to invade and destroy healthy brain tissue 
In glioma, the tumor cells look similar to healthy brain cells called glial cells 
The glial cells surround and support nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord 
Risk factors Things that can increase the risk of glioma include 
Gliomas are most common in adults between ages and years old 
Certain types of gliomas are more common in children and young adults 
One example of ionizing radiation is radiation therapy used to treat cancer 
Glioma can run in families, but this is very rare 
Researchers haven t found anything you can do to prevent glioma 
Overview Glomerulonephritis gloe MER u loe nuh FRY tis is inflammation of the tiny filters in the kidneys glomeruli 
Severe or prolonged inflammation associated with glomerulonephritis can damage the kidneys 
Pink or cola colored urine from red blood cells in your urine hematuria 
Foamy or bubbly urine due to excess protein in the urine proteinuria 
Fluid retention edema with swelling evident in your face, hands, feet and abdomen 
Sometimes the disease runs in families and sometimes the cause is unknown 
Factors that can lead to inflammation of the glomeruli include the following conditions 
Inflammation occurs when antibodies to the bacteria build up in the glomeruli 
Bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of your heart s chambers and valves 
Autoimmune diseasesAutoimmune diseases are illnesses caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissues 
It can cause progressive and permanent damage to the kidneys 
Immunoglobulin A IgA is an antibody that s a first line of defense against infectious agents 
IgA nephropathy occurs when deposits of the antibody accumulate in the glomeruli 
The inflammation and subsequent damage may go undetected for a long time 
Long term, poorly managed high blood pressure can cause scarring and inflammation of the glomeruli 
In this condition, scarring is scattered among some of the glomeruli 
One inherited form, Alport syndrome, also might impair hearing or vision 
Risk factors Some autoimmune diseases are linked with glomerulonephritis 
Complications Glomerulonephritis affects the ability of nephrons to filter the bloodstream efficiently 
Persistent inflammation results in long term damage and declining function of the kidneys 
Damage to the glomeruli from inflammation or scarring can lead to increased blood pressure 
These proteins play a role in regulating fluids and cholesterol levels 
In rare instances, nephrotic syndrome may cause a blood clot in a kidney blood vessel 
PreventionThere may be no way to prevent some forms of glomerulonephritis 
Seek prompt treatment of a strep infection with a sore throat or impetigo 
Control high blood pressure, which lessens the likelihood of damage to your kidneys from hypertension 
Golfer s elbow is similar to tennis elbow, which occurs on the outside of the elbow 
Rest and appropriate treatment can get you back into the swing of things 
Your elbow may feel stiff, and making a fist might hurt 
The pain of golfer s elbow can come on suddenly or gradually 
The pain might worsen with certain movements, such as swinging a golf club 
Your elbow is hot and inflamed, and you have a fever 
Besides golf, many activities and occupations can lead to golfer s elbow, including 
Improper technique with tennis strokes, especially the backhand, can cause injury to the tendon 
Improper pitching technique in baseball or softball can be another culprit 
Football, archery and javelin throwing also can cause golfer s elbow 
These occur in fields such as construction, plumbing and carpentry 
Risk factors You could be at higher risk of developing golfer s elbow if you re 
Even simple exercises can help your muscles absorb the energy of sudden physical stress 
Walk or jog for a few minutes to warm up your muscles 
Whatever your sport, ask an instructor to check your form to avoid overload on muscles 
If you re using older golfing irons, consider upgrading to lighter graphite clubs 
If you play tennis, make sure your racket fits you 
At the first sign of elbow pain, take a break 
Sexually transmitted diseases are infections spread mainly by contact with genitals or bodily fluids 
Gonorrhea bacteria can infect the urethra, rectum, female reproductive tract, mouth, throat or eyes 
Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during vaginal, oral or anal sexual activity 
Avoiding sexual activity and not having sex prevents the spread of gonorrhea 
Using a condom during sexual activity can help prevent the spread of gonorrhea 
Gonorrhea affecting the genital tractMale symptoms of gonorrhea infection include 
Gonorrhea at other sites in the bodyGonorrhea also can affect these parts of the body 
Also make an appointment if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea 
Complications Untreated gonorrhea can lead to major complications, such as 
Gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease PID 
PID can result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility 
This inflammation is known as epididymitis and without treatment it can lead to infertility 
Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of the body 
Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results 
Babies who get gonorrhea during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections 
Not having sex and avoiding sexual activity is the surest way to prevent gonorrhea 
Be sure you and your partner are tested for sexually transmitted infections 
Before you have sex, get tested and share the results with each other 
Don t have sex with someone who appears to have a sexually transmitted infection 
Regular screening also is recommended for men who have sex with men 
The most common type affects young adults, usually on the hands and feet 
Minor skin injuries and some medicines might trigger the condition 
It s not contagious and usually not painful, but it can make you feel self conscious 
And if it becomes a long term condition, it can cause emotional distress 
Treatment might clear the skin gradually, but the bumps tend to come back 
Untreated, the condition might last from a few weeks to decades 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms of granuloma annulare can vary, depending on the type 
The rash occurs most commonly on the hands, feet, wrists and ankles of young adults 
A type that usually affects young children is called subcutaneous granuloma annulare 
It produces small, firm lumps under the skin, instead of a rash 
Early diagnosis and treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis might lead to a full recovery 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis can develop suddenly or over several months 
The first warning signs usually involve your sinuses, throat or lungs 
Pus like drainage with crusts from your nose, stuffiness, sinus infections and nosebleeds 
When the kidneys are affected, blood and urine tests can detect the problem 
Because this disease can worsen quickly, early diagnosis is key to getting effective treatment 
It s not contagious, and there s no evidence that it s inherited 
The condition can lead to inflamed, narrowed blood vessels and harmful inflammatory tissue masses granulomas 
Risk factors Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can occur at any age 
It most often affects people between the ages of and 
A loss of height in the bridge of the nose saddling caused by weakened cartilage 
A blood clot forming in one or more deep veins, usually in your leg 
Although a number of disorders may result in hyperthyroidism, Graves disease is a common cause 
Heat sensitivity and an increase in perspiration or warm, moist skin 
Thick, red skin usually on the shins or tops of the feet Graves dermopathy 
Causes Graves disease is caused by a malfunction in the body s disease fighting immune system 
Graves ophthalmopathy often appears at the same time as hyperthyroidism or several months later 
Graves ophthalmopathy can also occur even if there s no hyperthyroidism 
Women are much more likely to develop Graves disease than are men 
Cigarette smoking, which can affect the immune system, increases the risk of Graves disease 
Smokers who have Graves disease are also at increased risk of developing Graves ophthalmopathy 
It s more likely when severe hyperthyroidism is untreated or treated inadequately 
Untreated hyperthyroidism also can lead to weak, brittle bones osteoporosis 
Too much thyroid hormone interferes with your body s ability to incorporate calcium into your bones 
Group B strep disease Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
In newborns, however, it can cause a serious illness known as group B strep disease 
Older adults are at increased risk of illness due to group B strep, too 
If you re a healthy adult, there s nothing you need to do about group B strep 
If you re pregnant, get a group B strep screening test during your third trimester 
If you have group B strep, antibiotic treatment during labor can protect your baby 
SymptomsInfantsMost babies born to women carrying group B strep are healthy 
Swelling, warmth or redness in the area of the infection 
Swelling, warmth or redness over the area of the infection 
Causes Many healthy people carry group B strep bacteria in their bodies 
Group B strep bacteria aren t sexually transmitted, and they re not spread through food or water 
How the bacteria are spread to anyone other than newborns isn t known 
The mother s water breaks hours or more before delivery 
The mother has an infection of the placental tissues and amniotic fluid chorioamnionitis 
The mother has a urinary tract infection during the pregnancy 
The mother s temperature is greater than F C during labor 
The mother previously delivered an infant with group B strep disease 
AdultsAdults age and older are at increased risk of group B strep 
Complications Group B strep infection can lead to life threatening disease in infants, including 
Inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord meningitis 
If you re pregnant, group B strep can cause the following 
A positive test indicates that you carry group B strep 
Haven t delivered your baby within hours of your water breaking 
Go into labor before weeks and haven t been tested for group B strep 
Although these pains are called growing pains, there s no evidence that growth hurts 
SymptomsGrowing pains usually cause an aching or throbbing feeling in the legs 
Some children may also experience abdominal pain or headaches during episodes of growing pains 
Growing pains often strike in the late afternoon or early evening and disappear by morning 
Sometimes the pain awakens a child in the middle of the night 
But there s no evidence that a child s growth is painful 
Growing pains don t usually happen where growth is occurring or during times of rapid growth 
It s been suggested that growing pains may be linked to restless legs syndrome 
Risk factors Growing pains are common in preschool and school age children 
Without treatment, periodontitis can destroy the bone that supports your teeth 
This can cause teeth to loosen or lead to tooth loss 
It s often the result of not taking care of your mouth and teeth 
New spaces that develop between your teeth that look like black triangles 
A change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite 
When to see a dentistFollow your dentist s recommended schedule for regular checkups 
The sooner you get care, the better your chances of reversing damage from periodontitis 
Causes In most cases, the development of periodontitis starts with plaque 
Plaque is a sticky film mainly made up of bacteria 
If not treated, here s how plaque can advance over time to periodontitis 
Plaque can harden under your gumline into tartar if it stays on your teeth 
Plaque can cause gingivitis, the mildest form of gum disease 
Gingivitis is irritation and swelling of the gum tissue around the base of your teeth 
Ongoing gum irritation and swelling, called inflammation, can cause periodontitis 
Eventually this causes deep pockets to form between your gums and teeth 
These pockets fill with plaque, tartar and bacteria and become deeper over time 
If not treated, these deep infections cause a loss of tissue and bone 
Also, ongoing inflammation can put a strain on your immune system, causing other health problems 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of periodontitis include 
Hormonal changes, such as those related to pregnancy or menopause 
Conditions that lower immunity, such as leukemia, HIV AIDS and cancer treatment 
Certain diseases, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn s disease 
Start this routine at a young age and keep it throughout life 
Flossing before you brush allows you to clean away the loosened food bits and bacteria 
See your dentist regularly for cleanings, usually every to months 
Helicobacter pylori H pylori infection Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
SymptomsMost people with H pylori infection will never have any signs or symptoms 
Stomach pain that may be worse when your stomach is empty 
Severe or ongoing stomach abdominal pain that may awaken you from sleep 
Bloody or black vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds 
Causes H pylori infection occurs when H pylori bacteria infect your stomach 
H pylori may also be spread through contaminated food or water 
Risk factors People often get H pylori infection during childhood 
Having a reliable supply of clean, running water helps reduce the risk of H pylori 
People living in developing countries have a higher risk of H pylori infection 
Complications Complications associated with H pylori infection include 
Ulcers H pylori can damage the protective lining of the stomach and small intestine 
This can allow stomach acid to create an open sore ulcer 
About of people with H pylori will develop an ulcer 
H pylori infection can affect the stomach, causing irritation and swelling gastritis 
H pylori infection is a strong risk factor for certain types of stomach cancer 
Together you can decide whether you may benefit from H pylori testing 
Overview Trichotillomania trik o til o MAY nee uh , also called hair pulling disorder, is a mental health condition 
You may try to resist the urges, but you can t stop 
Trichotillomania is part of a group of conditions known as body focused repetitive behaviors 
Pulling out hair from the scalp often leaves patchy bald spots 
You may go to great lengths to hide the hair loss 
For some people, trichotillomania may be mild and can be managed 
Some treatment options may help reduce hair pulling or stop it entirely 
A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled out 
Playing with pulled out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face 
Often trichotillomania also includes picking your skin, biting your nails or chewing your lips 
An episode can last from a few seconds to hours 
You may pull out your hair without even realizing that you re doing it 
This might happen, for example, when you re bored, reading or watching TV 
You may pull out your hair on purpose to relieve tension or distress 
You may find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides some relief 
For example, hormone changes during the menstrual period can worsen symptoms in some females 
Rarely, pulling out hair ends within a few years of starting 
Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it s a mental health condition 
Risk factors These factors tend to increase the risk of trichotillomania 
Genetics may play a role in the development of trichotillomania 
Some people may have hair or skin conditions that feel uncomfortable 
This may focus their attention toward pulling hair or picking at their scalp 
Other conditions, such as depression, anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorder OCD may occur along with trichotillomania 
Severely stressful situations or events may trigger trichotillomania in some people 
Boredom, isolation and privacy often increase the likelihood of hair pulling 
In early childhood, trichotillomania occurs just as often in boys and girls 
Complications Although it may not seem serious, trichotillomania can have harmful effects on your life 
You may feel frustrated, ashamed and embarrassed because of your condition and hair loss 
You may feel that you don t have control over pulling out your hair 
You may experience low self esteem, depression, anxiety, and problems with alcohol or drugs 
Hair loss may lead you to avoid social activities and school and job opportunities 
You may wear wigs, style your hair to disguise bald patches or wear false eyelashes 
Wearing shoes that don t fit well can cause hammertoe and mallet toe 
Other causes are foot injury and certain illnesses, such as diabetes 
A hammertoe has an unusual bend in the middle joint of a toe 
Mallet toe has a bend in the joint nearest the toenail 
Hammertoe and mallet toe usually occur in the second, third and fourth toes 
Surgery can correct the condition and relieve the pressure if these treatments don t work 
Growth of corns and calluses from rubbing against shoes or against the ground 
In time, the toe might remain curled even when not in shoes 
If the muscles aren t balanced, they can put pressure on the tendons and joints 
This imbalance can lead to hammertoe and mallet toe over time 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of hammertoe and mallet toe include 
Women are more likely to develop hammertoe or mallet toe than are men 
Arthritis and diabetes can increase the risk of having foot problems 
Complications For a while, the toe still might be able to unbend 
But over time, the tendons and joints of a hammertoe or mallet toe might tighten 
Shoes can rub against the higher part of the bent toe 
PreventionShoes that fit well can prevent many foot, heel and ankle problems 
Not wearing high heels will help prevent toe and back problems 
Shoes with laces or straps are roomier and easier to make feel comfortable 
Shoe size especially the width can change with age 
Hamstring injuries can occur in runners and in dancers as well 
Rarely, surgery is done to repair a hamstring muscle or tendon 
SymptomsA hamstring injury typically causes a sudden, sharp pain in the back of the thigh 
When to see a doctorMild hamstring strains can be treated at home 
These muscles make it possible to extend the leg back and to bend the knee 
Stretching or overloading any one of these muscles beyond its limit can cause injury 
Sports that require sprinting or running might make a hamstring injury more likely 
So might other activities that can require extreme stretching, such as dancing 
People who have had one hamstring injury are more likely to have another one 
Tired muscles, weak muscles and muscles that don t stretch well 
Tired or weak muscles are more likely to be injured 
If you have a job that s physically demanding, staying in shape can help prevent injuries 
Ask your health care provider about good exercises to do regularly 
Hand foot and mouth disease Overview Hand foot and mouth disease is a mild, contagious viral infection common in young children 
Symptoms include sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet 
SymptomsHand foot and mouth disease may cause all of the following symptoms or only some of them 
Painful, blister like lesions on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks 
A rash on the palms, soles and sometimes the buttocks 
The rash is not itchy, but sometimes it has blisters 
Children may get a fever and develop a sore throat 
A rash on the hands and feet and sometimes on the buttocks may also appear 
Other features of herpangina include a sudden high fever and, in some instances, seizure 
In rare cases, sores develop on the hands, feet or other parts of the body 
When to see a doctorHand foot and mouth disease is usually a minor illness 
It typically only causes fever and mild symptoms for a few days 
Call your provider, too, if your child s symptoms don t improve after days 
Causes The most common cause of hand foot and mouth disease is infection from coxsackievirus 
This coxsackievirus belongs to a group of viruses called nonpolio enteroviruses 
Most people get the coxsackievirus infection and hand foot and mouth disease through the mouth 
The illness spreads by person to person contact with an infected person s 
Respiratory droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or sneeze 
Common in child care settingHand foot and mouth disease is most common in children in child care 
That s because young children need frequent diaper changes and help using the toilet 
They also tend to put their hands in their mouths 
Your child is most contagious during the first week of having hand foot and mouth disease 
But the virus can remain in the body for weeks after the symptoms go away 
Some people, especially adults, can pass the virus without showing any symptoms of the disease 
Risk factors Age is the main risk factor for hand foot and mouth disease 
The disease mostly affects children younger than ages to years 
Children in child care settings are especially vulnerable because the infection spreads by person to person contact 
Hand foot mouth disease typically affects young children, but anyone can get it 
Older children and adults are thought to have immunity against hand foot and mouth disease 
They often build antibodies after exposure to the viruses that cause the disease 
Complications The most common complication of hand foot and mouth disease is dehydration 
The illness can cause sores in the mouth and throat, making it painful to swallow 
If children become too dehydrated, they may need intravenous IV fluids in the hospital 
It usually only causes fever and mild symptoms for a few days 
Sometimes the enterovirus that causes hand foot and mouth disease enters the brain and causes serious complications 
PreventionYou can lower your child s risk of hand foot and mouth disease in many ways 
Be sure to wash your hands after using the toilet or changing a diaper 
Show your children how to wash their hands and help them do it often 
Clean high traffic areas and surfaces first with soap and water 
Next, clean with a diluted solution of chlorine bleach and water 
If you re in a child care setting, follow a strict schedule of cleaning and disinfecting 
Symptoms are usually in full effect the morning after a night of heavy drinking 
Depending on what and how much alcohol you drank, you may notice 
When to see a doctorHangovers after a single night s drinking go away on their own 
In some cases, this can lead to coma and death 
Irregular breathing a gap of more than seconds between breaths 
Blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels 
Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder to see 
A person who can t be awakened is at risk of dying 
You lose extra body liquid by urinating more than usual 
Symptoms of dehydration include extra thirst, tiredness, headache, dizziness and lightheadedness 
The immune system may make certain substances linked to the body s defense system 
This commonly causes physical symptoms that make you feel as if you re ill 
If your blood sugar dips too low, you may feel extra tired, weak and shaky 
Not getting good quality sleep may leave you groggy and tired 
These give many types of alcoholic beverages their taste and smell 
Congeners are more likely to produce a hangover or make a hangover worse 
Risk factors Anyone who drinks alcohol can have a hangover 
But some people are more likely to have hangovers than others are 
Issues that may make a hangover more likely or worse include 
Smoking along with drinking appears to raise the likelihood of a hangover 
Poor quality sleep and not getting enough sleep usually follow drinking alcohol 
Some people have a headache a few hours after drinking wine especially red wine 
But it s different from a hangover, which may or may not include a headache 
More research is needed to find the exact cause of wine headache 
Complications When you have a hangover, you re likely to have problems with 
Problems being on time or not showing up at all 
PreventionSome companies use misleading advertising to claim that their products can prevent hangovers 
But the only guaranteed way to prevent a hangover is to not drink alcohol 
The less alcohol you drink, the less likely you are to have a hangover 
Alcohol enters the body more quickly if your stomach is empty 
It may help to eat something before drinking alcohol and during the time you re drinking 
But remember that all types of alcohol can cause a hangover 
Drinking a full glass of water after each alcoholic drink will help you stay hydrated 
Decide ahead of time how many drinks you ll have and stick to it 
Don t have more than one alcoholic drink in an hour 
Stop drinking completely when you ve reached your limit or before then 
These medicines may not work well together with other medicines you take 
And acetaminophen Tylenol, others may cause serious liver damage if taken with too much alcohol 
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Several strains of the hantavirus can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome 
The most common carrier in North America is the deer mouse 
Each strain of the hantavirus has a preferred rodent carrier 
Rodent carriers in South America include the rice rat and the vesper mouse 
TransmissionThe virus is present in the rodent s urine, feces or saliva 
You can come in contact with the virus in the following ways 
These variants of the virus have other animal carriers in Africa, Asia and Europe 
However, any exposure to rodent habitats can increase the risk of disease 
Common sites for exposure to rodent nests, urine and droppings include 
Activities that can increase the risk of exposure to the hantavirus include 
Severe disease can result in failure of the heart to deliver oxygen to the body 
Mice can squeeze through holes as small as inch millimeters wide 
Seal holes with wire screening, steel wool, metal flashing or cement 
Clear brush, grass and junk away from a building s foundation 
Exercise caution while using poison bait traps, as the poison also can harm people and pets 
Open up and air out cabins, campers or infrequently used buildings before cleaning 
Safe cleanup proceduresSafe cleaning will help prevent the spread of viruses 
Use paper towels to clean up and dispose of towels in garbage 
Overview Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus 
Most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage 
Practicing good hygiene, including washing hands frequently, can prevent the spread of the virus 
SymptomsHepatitis A symptoms typically appear a few weeks after you ve had the virus 
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes jaundice 
These symptoms may be relatively mild and go away in a few weeks 
Sometimes, however, hepatitis A results in a severe illness that lasts several months 
You ate at a restaurant with a hepatitis A outbreak 
You recently had sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A 
Causes Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that infects liver cells and causes inflammation 
The inflammation can affect how your liver works and cause other symptoms of hepatitis A 
You may get hepatitis A when you eat or drink something contaminated with infected stool 
The virus can live on surfaces for a few months 
The virus does not spread through casual contact or by sneezing or coughing 
Here are some of the specific ways the hepatitis A virus can spread 
Travel or work in areas of the world where hepatitis A is common 
Are a man who has sexual contact with other men 
Have any type of sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A 
Use any type of recreational drugs, not just those that are injected 
Acute liver failure requires a stay in the hospital for monitoring and treatment 
Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant 
PreventionThe hepatitis A vaccine can prevent infection with the virus 
The first shot is followed by a booster shot six months later 
This vaccine combination is given in three shots over six months 
All children at age year, or older children who didn t receive the childhood vaccine 
Family and caregivers of adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common 
People in direct contact with others who have hepatitis A 
Laboratory workers who may come into contact with hepatitis A 
People who work or travel in parts of the world where hepatitis A is common 
People who use any type of recreational drugs, not just injected ones 
People with chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C 
Wash all fresh fruits and vegetables in bottled water and peel them yourself 
Drink bottled water and use it when brushing your teeth 
Overview Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus HBV 
But for others, the infection becomes chronic, meaning it lasts more than six months 
Most adults with hepatitis B recover fully, even if their symptoms are severe 
Infants and children are more likely to develop a long lasting hepatitis B infection 
A vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, but there s no cure if you have the condition 
If you re infected, taking certain precautions can help prevent spreading the virus to others 
SymptomsSymptoms of acute hepatitis B range from mild to severe 
Some people, usually young children, may not have any symptoms 
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, also called jaundice 
If you think you have symptoms of hepatitis B, contact your health care provider 
Causes Hepatitis B infection is caused by the hepatitis B virus HBV 
The virus is passed from person to person through blood, semen or other body fluids 
You may get hepatitis B if you have unprotected sex with someone who is infected 
HBV easily spreads through needles and syringes contaminated with infected blood 
Sharing IV drug paraphernalia puts you at high risk of hepatitis B 
Pregnant women infected with HBV can pass the virus to their babies during childbirth 
However, the newborn can be vaccinated to avoid getting infected in almost all cases 
Acute vs chronic hepatitis BHepatitis B infection may be short lived, also called acute 
Or it might last a long time, also known as chronic 
It lingers because your immune system can t fight off the infection 
Some people with chronic hepatitis B may have no symptoms at all 
Some may have ongoing fatigue and mild symptoms of acute hepatitis 
Have unprotected sex with multiple sex partners or with someone who s infected with HBV 
Complications Having a chronic HBV infection can lead to serious complications, such as 
People with chronic hepatitis B infection have an increased risk of liver cancer 
When that occurs, a liver transplant is necessary to stay alive 
This can lead to significant liver damage or even liver failure 
This includes people on immunosuppressive medications, such as high dose corticosteroids or chemotherapy 
Before taking these medications, you should be tested for hepatitis B 
People with chronic hepatitis B may develop kidney disease or inflammation of blood vessels 
Those who work or live in a center for people who are developmentally disabled 
Health care workers, emergency workers and other people who come into contact with blood 
People who inject illegal drugs or share needles and syringes 
Take precautions to avoid HBVOther ways to reduce your risk of HBV include 
If you can t stop, use a sterile needle each time you inject illicit drugs 
If you get a piercing or tattoo, look for a reputable shop 
It s usually given in a series of three injections over a six month period 
Hepatocellular carcinomaHepatocellular carcinoma HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer 
Liver biopsy, in some cases, to remove a sample of liver tissue for laboratory testing 
These procedures include radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and ablation using alcohol or microwaves 
Immunotherapy drugs use your body s germ fighting immune system to attack the cancer cells 
Ask your doctor whether you re eligible to participate in a clinical trial 
Overview Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver swelling, called inflammation 
But many people with hepatitis C don t know they have it 
Screening is for everyone, even those who don t have symptoms or known liver disease 
SymptomsEvery long term hepatitis C infection starts with what s called an acute phase 
Acute hepatitis C usually isn t diagnosed because it rarely causes symptoms 
Symptoms appear only after the virus damages the liver enough to cause them 
Also, yellowing of the whites of the eyes in white, Black and brown people 
Some people clear the infection from their bodies after the acute phase 
Causes Hepatitis C infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus HCV 
Around the world, hepatitis C infection exists in several forms, called genotypes 
The most common hepatitis C genotype in the United States is type 
Anyone who has ever injected, snorted or inhaled an illegal drug 
Anyone who has atypical liver test results in which the cause wasn t found 
People with hemophilia who were treated with clotting factors before 
People who got donated blood or organ transplants before 
Complications Hepatitis C infection that continues over many years can cause serious complications, such as 
Liver scarring makes it hard for the liver to work 
A small number of people with hepatitis C infection get liver cancer 
A lot of scarring can cause the liver to stop working 
For piercing or tattooing, look for a shop that s known to be clean 
Don t have sex without protection with any partner whose health status you don t know 
Overview Head and neck cancers are cancers that start in the head and neck area 
There are many kinds of cancer that can happen in the head and neck 
Instead, it s a category of cancers that have some things in common 
For example, many head and neck cancers share some risk factors and treatments 
These thin, flat cells make up the outer layer of the skin 
They also line the inside of the nose, mouth and throat 
Cancers that begin in the squamous cells are called squamous cell carcinomas 
Which treatment you ll have for your head and neck cancer depends on many factors 
Treatment options might include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and others 
A lump in the neck that you might be able to feel through the skin 
A sore on the skin of the face, neck or lips that doesn t heal 
Causes Experts aren t certain exactly what causes head and neck cancers 
What causes a cancer may depend on where the cancer starts 
Risk factors Head and neck cancers have some risk factors in common 
Other risk factors depend on the location of the cancer 
In general, things that increase the risk of head and neck cancers include 
Examples of kinds of tobacco include cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff 
Frequent and heavy drinking increases the risk of many types of head and neck cancer 
Many throat cancers are thought to be caused by HPV 
Chemicals at home and at work can increase the risk 
Ultraviolet light also can come from the lights used in tanning beds 
Other steps you can take may depend on the specific type of cancer 
Don t use tobaccoIf you don t smoke or use other kinds of tobacco, don t start 
If you do use tobacco, make a plan to quit 
Talk with a healthcare professional about things that can help you quit 
Ask a healthcare professional whether the HPV vaccine is right for you 
Reapply every two hours, or more often if you re swimming or sweating 
Having head lice isn t a sign of poor personal hygiene or an unclean living environment 
Follow treatment instructions carefully to rid the scalp and hair of lice and their eggs 
But there is little to no clinical evidence that they re effective 
The most common symptom of head lice is itching on the scalp, neck and ears 
Nits stick to hair shafts and may be hard to see because they re very tiny 
They re easiest to spot around the ears and the hairline of the neck 
However, the presence of nits doesn t mean there are live lice 
Scratching can lead to small, red bumps that may sometimes get infected with bacteria 
Your or your child s health care provider can confirm that head lice are present 
Nymphs, immature forms of the louse that become mature adults after to days 
Adult lice, which can live for to weeks 
The female louse lays to eggs a day 
It s less common for head lice to spread without direct contact 
But the insects may spread from one person to another through personal items, such as 
Head lice may also spread when items of clothing are stored together 
Household pets, such as dogs and cats, don t play a role in spreading head lice 
Risk factors Head lice are spread primarily by direct head to head contact 
The chance of indirect spread from personal items is slight 
However, to help prevent head lice from spreading, you may tell your child to 
Hang clothes on a separate hook from other children s clothes 
It s often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound 
Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful 
The right medicines, combined with self help remedies and lifestyle changes, might help 
AuraFor some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines 
Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light 
Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body 
AttackA migraine usually lasts from to hours if untreated 
Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month 
Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides 
Sudden head movement might bring on the pain again briefly 
When to see a doctorMigraines are often undiagnosed and untreated 
Then make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your headaches 
A chronic headache that is worse after coughing, exertion, straining or a sudden movement 
Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene related peptide CGRP 
Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, also can worsen migraines 
Some women, however, find that their migraines occur less often when taking these medications 
These include alcohol, especially wine, and too much caffeine, such as coffee 
Bright or flashing lights can induce migraines, as can loud sounds 
Missing sleep or getting too much sleep can trigger migraines in some people 
A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine 
Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines 
Aged cheeses and salty and processed foods might trigger migraines 
These include the sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate MSG , found in many foods 
Risk factors Several factors make you more prone to having migraines, including 
Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence 
Women are three times more likely than men to have migraines 
Complications Taking painkillers too often can trigger serious medication overuse headaches 
The risk seems to be highest with aspirin, acetaminophen Tylenol, others and caffeine combinations 
Medication overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches 
You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle 
Or, more commonly, you may experience a sudden, severe headache just before or during orgasm 
A dull ache in the head and neck that intensifies as sexual excitement increases 
A sudden, severe, throbbing headache that occurs just before or at the moment of orgasm 
Others may linger for hours or even to days 
Some people may only have one attack during their lives 
When to see a doctorSex headaches aren t usually a cause for concern 
Causes Any type of sexual activity that leads to orgasm can trigger sex headaches 
Sex headaches that come on suddenly are more likely to be associated with 
A widening or bubble in the wall of an artery inside your head intracranial aneurysm 
Bleeding into the wall of an artery leading to the brain dissection 
Narrowing of the arteries in the brain reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome 
Being prone to migraines increases your risk of sex headaches 
PreventionSometimes sex headaches can be prevented by stopping sexual activity before orgasm 
Taking a more passive role during sex also may help 
You may feel pressure around the eyes, cheeks and forehead 
But, this pain might actually be caused by a migraine 
Pain, pressure and fullness in the cheeks, brow or forehead 
Both migraine and sinusitis headache pain often get worse when you bend forward 
These are due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in a migraine attack 
You have a severe headache, and pain medicine available without a prescription doesn t help 
Causes Sinus headaches are usually associated with migraines or other forms of headaches 
One or more of these suggestions may be helpful for you 
Your provider may recommend you reduce your caffeine and alcohol intake and avoid tobacco 
In general, establish a daily routine with regular sleep patterns and regular meals 
Regular aerobic exercise reduces tension and can help prevent headaches 
If your provider agrees, choose any aerobic exercise you enjoy, including walking, swimming and cycling 
These medications include birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy 
Talk with your provider about the appropriate alternatives or dosages for you 
During a spinal tap, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal 
If spinal fluid leaks through the tiny puncture site, you may develop a spinal headache 
However, severe spinal headaches lasting hours or more may need treatment 
Dull, throbbing pain that varies in intensity from mild to very severe 
Sometimes epidural anesthesia may lead to a spinal headache as well 
Risk factors Risk factors for spinal headaches include 
Tension type headaches are divided into two main categories episodic and chronic 
Episodic tension type headachesEpisodic tension type headaches can last from minutes to a week 
Chronic tension type headachesThis type of tension type headache lasts hours and may be constant 
Chronic tension type headaches occur or more days a month for at least three months 
Tension type headaches versus migrainesTension type headaches can be hard to tell apart from migraines 
And if you have frequent episodic tension type headaches, you also can have migraines 
People with tension type headaches also don t usually experience nausea or vomiting with head pain 
While physical activity tends to make migraine pain worse, it doesn t affect tension type headache pain 
When to see a doctorMake an appointment with a health care professional 
Also make an appointment if tension type headaches disrupt your life 
Also see your care professional if your headaches suddenly feel different 
Occasionally, headaches may be caused by a serious medical condition 
Get emergency care if you have any of these symptoms 
Headache after a head injury, especially if the headache gets worse 
They thought the muscle contractions were a result of emotions, tension or stress 
Muscle tenderness, a common symptom of tension type headaches, may result from this sensitized pain system 
TriggersStress is the most commonly reported trigger for tension type headaches 
Risk factors Most people experience a tension type headache at some point in their lives 
Frequent headache pain may make it hard to attend activities 
If you do go to your job, it may be hard to function as usual 
This training teaches you to control certain body responses that help reduce pain 
This type of talk therapy may help you learn to manage stress 
Doing this may help you have fewer or less painful headaches 
This can include deep breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation 
You can learn these methods in classes or at home using books or apps 
Overview Thunderclap headaches live up to their name, striking suddenly like a clap of thunder 
The pain of these severe headaches peaks within seconds 
Thunderclap headaches might be accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as 
In other cases, a variety of potentially life threatening conditions might be responsible, including 
Bleeding between the brain and membranes covering the brain subarachnoid hemorrhage 
A tear in the lining of an artery that supplies blood to the brain 
Headaches in children Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Headaches in children Overview Headaches in children are common and usually aren t serious 
Like adults, children can develop different types of headaches, including migraines or stress related tension headaches 
In general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently into certain categories 
A pressing tightness in the muscles of the head or neck 
Mild to moderate, nonpulsating pain on both sides of the head 
Headache that s not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the case with migraine 
Younger children may withdraw from regular play and want to sleep more 
Tension type headaches can last from minutes to several days 
Cluster headacheCluster headaches are uncommon in children under years of age 
Are accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or restlessness or agitation 
Follow an injury, such as a blow to the head 
Talk to your child s doctor if you re worried or have questions about your child s headaches 
Causes A number of factors can cause your child to develop headaches 
Also, contact a doctor if your child s head pain steadily worsens after a head injury 
Risk factors Any child can develop headaches, but they re more common in 
Children who have a family history of headaches or migraines 
PreventionThe following may help you prevent headaches or reduce the severity of headaches in children 
Behaviors that promote general good health also may help prevent headaches for your child 
Stress and busy schedules may increase the frequency of headaches 
If your child s headaches are linked to anxiety or depression, consider talking to a counselor 
A diary can help you determine what causes your child s headaches 
Note when the headaches start, how long they last and what, if anything, provides relief 
Avoid any food or drinks, such as those containing caffeine, that seem to trigger headaches 
Illness anxiety disorder is a long term condition that can fluctuate in severity 
It may increase with age or during times of stress 
But psychological counseling psychotherapy and sometimes medication can help ease your worries 
Being preoccupied with having or getting a serious disease or health condition 
Worrying that minor symptoms or body sensations mean you have a serious illness 
Finding little or no reassurance from doctor visits or negative test results 
Having so much distress about possible illnesses that it s hard for you to function 
Repeatedly checking your body for signs of illness or disease 
Avoiding people, places or activities for fear of health risks 
Frequently searching the internet for causes of symptoms or possible illnesses 
Significant health anxiety can cause real distress for the person, and reassurance isn t always helpful 
This can be frustrating and cause stress on families and relationships 
You may have a difficult time tolerating uncertainty over uncomfortable or unusual body sensations 
Often for older individuals, health related anxiety may focus on the fear of losing their memory 
Risk factors for illness anxiety disorder may include 
Threat of a serious illness that turns out not to be serious 
A serious childhood illness or a parent with a serious illness 
Personality traits, such as having a tendency toward being a worrier 
Relationship or family problems because excessive worrying can frustrate others 
Problems functioning in daily life, possibly even resulting in disability 
Financial problems due to excessive health care visits and medical bills 
PreventionLittle is known about how to prevent illness anxiety disorder, but these suggestions may help 
Stick with your treatment plan to help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms 
Aging and being around loud noises both can cause hearing loss 
Trouble understanding words, especially when in a crowd or a noisy place 
Trouble hearing the letters of the alphabet that aren t vowels 
Often asking others to speak more slowly, clearly and loudly 
Needing to turn up the volume of the television or radio 
Talk to your health care provider if loss of hearing is causing you trouble 
Sound waves pass through the outer ear and cause the eardrum to vibrate 
How hearing loss can occur Causes of hearing loss include 
Damaged or missing hairs or nerve cells don t send electrical signals well 
It may be hard to pick out words against background noise 
Over time, earwax can block the ear canal and keep sound waves from passing through 
In the outer or middle ear, any of these can cause hearing loss 
Being around loud sounds can damage the cells of the inner ear 
Damage can happen by being around loud noises over time 
These include ringing in the ears, also known as tinnitus, or hearing loss 
Illnesses such as meningitis that cause high fever can harm the cochlea 
soundsThe chart below lists common sounds and their decibel levels 
A decibel is a unit used to measure how loud sound is 
The louder the noise, the less time it takes to cause lasting hearing damage 
Based on The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH , 
Hearing loss is also linked to loss of thinking skills, known as cognitive impairment 
In the workplace, plastic earplugs or glycerin filled earmuffs can help protect hearing 
If you work around a lot of noise, think about regular hearing tests 
If you ve lost some hearing, you can take steps to prevent further loss 
Wearing hearing protectors or taking breaks from the noise can protect your ears 
Turning down the volume when listening to music helps too 
Sometimes, a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow 
A lack of blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle 
Prompt treatment is needed for a heart attack to prevent death 
Chest pain that may feel like pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing or aching 
Sometimes, the first symptom sign of a heart attack is sudden cardiac arrest 
But many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance 
Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart 
Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a health care provider 
Taking aspirin during a heart attack may reduce heart damage by preventing blood clotting 
Then check if the person is breathing and has a pulse 
In coronary artery disease, one or more of the heart coronary arteries are blocked 
Plaques can narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart 
If a plaque breaks open, it can cause a blood clot in the heart 
A partial blockage often means you ve had a non ST elevation myocardial infarction NSTEMI 
However, some people with non ST elevation myocardial infarction NSTEMI have a total blockage 
This is a severe squeezing of a blood vessel that s not blocked 
Other names for coronary artery spasms are Prinzmetal s angina, vasospastic angina or variant angina 
COVID and other viral infections may cause damage to the heart muscle 
This life threatening condition is caused by a tear inside a heart artery 
Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that lead to the heart 
A high level of certain blood fats called triglycerides also increases heart attack risk 
High blood sugar increases the risk of a heart attack 
Emotional stress, such as extreme anger, may increase the risk of a heart attack 
They can trigger a coronary artery spasm that can cause a heart attack 
Complications Heart attack complications are often due to heart muscle damage 
Heart attack damage can affect how electrical signals move through the heart, causing heartbeat changes 
This rare condition occurs when the heart is suddenly and abruptly unable to pump blood 
Sometimes a heart attack triggers a faulty immune system response 
This condition may be called Dressler syndrome, postmyocardial infarction syndrome or postcardiac injury syndrome 
A sudden change in the heart s signaling causes sudden cardiac arrest 
A heart attack increases the risk of this life threatening condition 
It can lead to death sudden cardiac death without immediate treatment 
Ask your health care provider how often you need checkups 
Your health care provider may prescribe drugs to protect and improve your heart health 
The sounds can be heard with a device called a stethoscope 
An innocent heart murmur is not a sign of heart disease and doesn t need treatment 
Other heart murmurs may be a sign of a serious heart condition 
Tests are needed to check the heart and heart valves 
SymptomsHarmless innocent heart murmurs usually don t cause any other symptoms 
Your provider can tell you if follow up care is needed 
Causes A heart murmur is caused by rapid, choppy turbulent blood flow through the heart 
Harmless innocent heart murmursA person with an innocent murmur usually has a typical heart 
Things that might change blood flow and cause an innocent heart murmur include 
Lack of healthy red blood cells that carry oxygen to body tissues anemia 
Sometimes, heart murmurs continue for life without causing serious health problems 
A calcified valve also may not close completely, letting blood flow backward 
When calcium affects the heart valves, it s called calcific or degenerative valve disease 
A murmur may occur if the infection is untreated and affects the heart valves 
Rheumatic fever may occur in those who don t get or complete treatment for strep throat 
When rheumatic fever affects the heart valves, it s called rheumatic heart disease 
Risk factors Things that increase the risk of heart murmurs in babies includes 
Use of certain medications, alcohol or illegal drugs by the mother during pregnancy 
Some medical conditions can increase the risk of heart murmurs, including 
A rare cancerous tumor that releases certain chemicals into the bloodstream carcinoid syndrome 
Blood disorders marked by a high number of certain white cells, called eosinophils hypereosinophilic syndrome 
Many childhood heart murmurs go away on their own as children grow 
Stress, exercise, medication or, rarely, a medical condition can trigger them 
Heart palpitations may be felt in the throat or neck as well as the chest 
Causes Often the cause of heart palpitations can t be found 
Strong emotional responses, such as stress, anxiety or panic attacks 
Stimulants, including caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines, and cold and cough medications that contain pseudoephedrine 
Risk factors Risk factors for heart palpitations include 
Certain medicines that contain stimulants, such as some cold or asthma medications 
Complications For palpitations caused by a heart condition, possible complications may include 
If the heart beats rapidly, blood pressure can drop, causing the person to faint 
If a clot breaks loose, it can block a brain artery, causing a stroke 
They keep blood flowing through the heart in the correct direction 
Sometimes a valve doesn t open or close all the way 
This can change how blood flows through the heart to the rest of the body 
Sometimes surgery is needed to repair or replace the heart valve 
SymptomsSome people with heart valve disease might not have symptoms for many years 
Shortness of breath at rest or when active or lying down 
The valve flaps become thick or stiff and sometimes can join together 
The valve flaps may not close tightly, causing blood to leak backward 
A solid sheet of tissue blocks the blood flow between the hear 
Risk factors Several things can increase the risk of heart valve disease, including 
High blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and other heart disease risk factors 
Heartburn Overview Heartburn is a burning pain in your chest, just behind your breastbone 
When to see a doctorChest pain may be a symptom of a heart attack 
You have weight loss because of poor appetite or difficulty eating 
The acid backup may be worse when you re bent over or lying down 
Risk factors Certain foods and drinks can trigger heartburn in some people, including 
Being overweight or pregnant also can increase your risk of experiencing heartburn 
gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD treatment may require prescription medications and, occasionally, surgery or other procedures 
Overview Heat exhaustion is a condition that happens when your body overheats 
Without prompt treatment, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, a life threatening condition 
Cool, moist skin with goose bumps when in the heat 
When to see a doctorIf you think you have heat exhaustion 
Contact your doctor if your symptoms get worse or they don t improve within one hour 
Causes The body s heat combined with environmental heat results in what s called your core temperature 
The average core temperature is about F C 
When your body can t cool itselfIn hot weather, your body cools itself mainly by sweating 
As a result, heat cramps may start in your body 
Symptoms of heat cramps often include heavy sweating, fatigue, thirst and muscle cramps 
Other causesBesides hot weather and strenuous activity, other causes of heat exhaustion include 
Dehydration, which lessens your body s ability to sweat and keep a normal temperature 
Alcohol use, which can affect your body s ability to regulate your temperature 
Overdressing, particularly in clothes that don t allow sweat to evaporate easily 
The body s ability to regulate its temperature isn t fully developed in children 
Some medicines can affect your body s ability to stay hydrated and respond properly to heat 
Some illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can increase your core temperature 
The body needs time to get used to higher temperatures 
The body hasn t had a chance to get used to the higher temperatures 
This makes you more prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke 
Complications If heat exhaustion isn t treated, it can lead to heatstroke 
It happens when your core body temperature reaches F C or higher 
Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 
Staying hydrated helps your body sweat and keep a normal body temperature 
This is a common cause of heat related deaths in children 
Keep parked cars locked to prevent a child from getting inside 
Take it easy during the hottest parts of the day 
Limit time spent working or exercising in heat until you re conditioned to it 
People who aren t used to hot weather are especially susceptible to heat related illness 
It can take several weeks for your body to adjust to hot weather 
Avoid the heat and act quickly if you notice symptoms of overheating 
Heat rash occurs when sweat is trapped in the skin 
Symptoms can range from small blisters to deep, inflamed lumps 
Heat rash usually goes away once the skin cools down 
Severe forms of the condition might need treatment from a health care provider 
SymptomsAdults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin 
In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest 
It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin 
The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina 
This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid filled bumps that break easily 
A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra 
Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus 
A less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of heat rash include 
Being on bedrest for a long time and having a fever 
A common complication is infection with bacteria, causing inflamed and itchy pustules 
PreventionTo help protect yourself or your child from heat rash 
In hot weather, dress in loose, lightweight clothing that wicks moisture away from the skin 
Avoid drugs that cause sweating, such as clonidine, beta blockers and opioids 
Untreated heatstroke can quickly damage your brain, heart, kidneys and muscles 
Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke 
Your skin may turn red as your body temperature increases 
Take immediate action to cool the overheated person while waiting for emergency treatment 
It occurs most often in older adults and in people with chronic illness 
In either type of heatstroke, your condition can be brought on by 
Wearing excess clothing that prevents sweat from evaporating easily and cooling your body 
Drinking alcohol, which can affect your body s ability to regulate your temperature 
Becoming dehydrated by not drinking enough water to replenish fluids lost through sweating 
Risk factors Anyone can develop heatstroke, but several factors increase your risk 
Both age groups usually have difficulty remaining hydrated, which also increases risk 
Limit activity for at least several days to allow yourself to acclimate to the change 
Some medications affect your body s ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat 
Certain chronic illnesses, such as heart or lung disease, might increase your risk of heatstroke 
So can being obese, being sedentary and having a history of previous heatstroke 
Wearing excess clothing or clothing that fits tightly won t allow your body to cool properly 
Staying hydrated will help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature 
When your car is parked, keep it locked to prevent a child from getting inside 
People who are not used to hot weather are especially susceptible to heat related illness 
Overview Plantar fasciitis PLAN tur fas e I tis is one of the most common causes of heel pain 
It is more common in runners and in people who are overweight 
It supports the arch of the foot and absorbs shock when walking 
Tension and stress on the fascia can cause small tears 
Plantar fasciitis is most common in people between the ages of and 
Complications Ignoring plantar fasciitis can result in chronic heel pain that hinders your regular activities 
The mark shows up at birth or in the first month of life 
Treatment generally isn t needed for a baby s hemangioma, as the mark fades over time 
Typically, there is little trace of it by age 
You also may think about treatment if the hemangioma is in a cosmetically sensitive area 
Many hemangiomas go away by age , and most go away by age 
The skin may be slightly discolored or raised after the hemangioma goes away 
Babies with a low birth weight also are more likely to have a hemangioma 
Complications At times, a hemangioma can break down and develop a sore 
However, there s no evidence that an untreated liver hemangioma can lead to liver cancer 
SymptomsIn most cases, a liver hemangioma doesn t cause any signs or symptoms 
When a liver hemangioma causes signs and symptoms, they may include 
Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food early satiety 
Causes It s not clear what causes a liver hemangioma to form 
Occasionally liver hemangiomas can be larger or occur in multiples 
Large hemangiomas can occur in young children, but this is rare 
Women are more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than are men 
Having a liver hemangioma doesn t mean you can t become pregnant 
If you re considering this type of medication, discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor 
Overview An intracranial hematoma is a collection of blood within the skull 
It s usually caused by a blood vessel that bursts in the brain 
It may also be caused by trauma such as a car accident or fall 
Loss of movement paralysis on the opposite side of the body from the head injury 
When to see a doctorAn intracranial hematoma can be life threatening, requiring emergency treatment 
Seek immediate medical attention after a blow to the head if you 
And even if you feel fine, ask someone to watch out for you 
Memory loss after a blow to your head can make you forget about the blow 
Causes A head injury is the most common cause of bleeding within the skull 
If you re an older adult, even mild head trauma can cause a hematoma 
There are three categories of hematoma subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma and intracerebral intraparenchymal hematoma 
The leaking blood forms a hematoma that presses on the brain tissue 
A hematoma that gets bigger can cause gradual loss of consciousness and possibly death 
Signs and symptoms take time to develop, sometimes days or weeks after the injury 
The most common cause of an epidural hematoma is trauma 
Diseases can cause spontaneous leakage of blood into the brain 
A head trauma can result in multiple severe intracerebral hematomas 
Wear a helmet and make sure your kids wear helmets 
Buckle your seat belt and make sure your kids are buckled in 
Do so every time you drive or ride in a motor vehicle 
A facial nerve injury or a tumor also can cause it 
These muscle movements, also called contractions, often start in the eyelid 
But over months to years, they occur almost all the time 
Sometimes, hemifacial spasms occur on both sides of the face 
However, the twitching doesn t occur on both sides of the face at the same time 
Excess iron is stored in your organs, especially your liver, heart and pancreas 
Only a few people who have the genes ever develop serious problems 
Early symptoms often overlap with those of other common conditions 
When symptoms typically appearThe most common type of hemochromatosis is present at birth 
Genetic testing can check if you have the gene that increases your risk of hemochromatosis 
Causes Hemochromatosis is most often caused by a change in a gene 
This gene controls the amount of iron your body absorbs from food 
This type of hemochromatosis is by far the most common type 
You inherit one HFE gene from each of your parents 
If you inherit two altered genes, you may develop hemochromatosis 
You also can pass the altered gene on to your children 
If you inherit one altered gene, you re unlikely to develop hemochromatosis 
It also controls how excess iron is stored in various organs 
This excess iron is stored in major organs, especially the liver 
It also can lead to long lasting diseases, such as cirrhosis, diabetes and heart failure 
However, not everyone develops iron overload to a degree that causes tissue and organ damage 
This causes the same problems in young people that hereditary hemochromatosis causes in adults 
This disorder is caused by changes in the hemojuvelin or hepcidin genes 
It is thought to be an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself 
People with certain types of anemia or liver disease may often need multiple blood transfusions 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of hemochromatosis include 
Hemochromatosis is less common in people of Black, Hispanic and Asian ancestry 
Men are more likely than women to develop symptoms of hemochromatosis at an earlier age 
After menopause or a hysterectomy, the risk increases for women 
Complications Untreated, hemochromatosis can lead to a number of complications 
Cirrhosis increases your risk of liver cancer and other life threatening complications 
Excess iron can lead to erectile dysfunction and loss of sex drive in men 
It can cause an absence of the menstrual cycle in women 
This damage can cause clots to form in the vessels all through the body 
Hemolytic uremic syndrome can lead to kidney failure, which can be life threatening 
Most often, infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli E coli bacteria is the cause 
It also can be the result of certain gene changes 
Seek emergency care if you or your child doesn t urinate for hours or more 
Some of the E coli strains make a toxin called Shiga toxin 
Most of the hundreds of types of E coli are typical and harmless 
But some strains of E coli can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome 
This can include infection with pneumococcal bacteria, human immunodeficiency virus HIV or a flu virus 
Rarely, these conditions can include pregnancy or conditions such as autoimmune disease or cancer 
An uncommon type of hemolytic uremic syndrome, called atypical, can be passed down through families 
Risk factors Hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E coli can occur if you 
Swim in pools or lakes that have feces with the bacteria 
The risk of getting hemolytic uremic syndrome is highest for 
Kidney failure, which can be sudden, called acute, or happen over time, called chronic 
Digestive tract problems, such as problems with the intestines, gallbladder or pancreas 
PreventionMeat or produce that has E coli won t always look, feel or smell bad 
To protect against E coli infection and other illnesses from foods 
Wash hands well before eating and after using the restroom and changing diapers 
Cook meat to an inside temperature of at least degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius 
Defrost meat in the microwave or refrigerator, not on the counter 
Don t put cooked meat on plates that had raw meat on them 
Internal bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and be life threatening 
Treatment includes regular replacement of the specific clotting factor that is reduced 
Newer therapies that don t contain clotting factors also are being used 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of hemophilia vary, depending on your level of clotting factors 
If your clotting factor level is mildly reduced, you might bleed only after surgery or trauma 
If your deficiency is severe, you can bleed easily for seemingly no reason 
Unexplained and excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, or after surgery or dental work 
This rarely happens, but it s one of the most serious complications that can occur 
When to see a doctorSeek emergency care if you or your child has 
Swollen joints that are hot to the touch and painful to bend 
Congenital hemophiliaHemophilia is usually inherited, meaning a person is born with the disorder congenital 
Congenital hemophilia is classified by the type of clotting factor that s low 
Acquired hemophiliaSome people develop hemophilia with no family history of the disorder 
Females inherit an X chromosome from the mother and an X chromosome from the father 
Males inherit an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father 
But some carriers can have bleeding symptoms if their clotting factors are moderately decreased 
Males are much more likely to have hemophilia than are females 
Bleeding that occurs in deep muscle can cause the limbs to swell 
The swelling can press on nerves and lead to numbness or pain 
Depending on where the bleeding occurs, it could be life threatening 
Internal bleeding can put pressure on the joints, causing severe pain 
Left untreated, frequent internal bleeding can cause arthritis or destruction of the joint 
Overview Hemorrhoids HEM uh roids , also called piles, are swollen veins in the anus and lower rectum 
They also can develop under the skin around the anus, called external hemorrhoids 
Many people get relief with home treatments and lifestyle changes 
SymptomsSymptoms of hemorrhoids usually depend on the type of hemorrhoid 
You usually can t see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort 
A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening, called a prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid 
Thrombosed hemorrhoidsBlood can pool in an external hemorrhoid and form a clot, called a thrombus 
Rectal bleeding can happen with other diseases, including colorectal cancer and anal cancer 
Seek emergency care if you have large amounts of rectal bleeding, lightheadedness, dizziness or faintness 
Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to 
Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet 
Risk factors As people age, the risk of hemorrhoids increases 
Complications Complications of hemorrhoids are rare but may include 
Although not dangerous, it can be extremely painful and sometimes needs to be drained 
To prevent hemorrhoids and reduce symptoms of hemorrhoids, follow these tips 
This will help you avoid the straining that can cause hemorrhoids 
Otherwise, the supplements can cause constipation or make it worse 
Stay active to help prevent constipation and reduce pressure on veins 
Henoch Schonlein purpura can also cause abdominal pain and aching joints 
Henoch Schonlein purpura can affect anyone, but it s most common in children under 
Medical care is generally needed if the disorder affects the kidneys 
Reddish purple spots that look like bruises develop on the buttocks, legs and feet 
Joint pain sometimes precedes the classical rash by one or two weeks 
These symptoms subside when the disease clears and leave no lasting damage 
Many children with Henoch Schonlein purpura develop belly pain, nausea, vomiting and bloody stools 
Usually this goes away once the illness passes, but some people develop persistent kidney disease 
It may be the result of the immune system responding inappropriately to certain triggers 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of developing Henoch Schonlein purpura include 
Henoch Schonlein purpura is slightly more common in males than in females 
White and Asian children are more likely to develop Henoch Schonlein purpura than are black children 
Complications For most people, symptoms improve within a month, leaving no lasting problems 
The most serious complication of Henoch Schonlein purpura is kidney damage 
Occasionally the damage is severe enough that dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed 
Toxic hepatitis can be caused by alcohol, chemicals, drugs or nutritional supplements 
In some cases, toxic hepatitis develops within hours or days of exposure to a toxin 
In other cases, it may take months of regular use before signs and symptoms appear 
The symptoms of toxic hepatitis often go away when exposure to the toxin stops 
When signs and symptoms of toxic hepatitis occur, they may include 
Abdominal pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen 
Overdoses of some medications, such as acetaminophen Tylenol, others , can lead to liver failure 
Both options are free, confidential, and available hours a day 
The liver normally removes and breaks down most drugs and chemicals from your bloodstream 
Breaking down toxins creates byproducts that can damage the liver 
Chemicals you may be exposed to on the job can cause liver injury 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of toxic hepatitis include 
As you age, your liver breaks down harmful substances more slowly 
This means that toxins and their byproducts stay in your body longer 
Drinking alcohol while taking medications or certain herbal supplements increases the risk of toxicity 
Working with certain industrial chemicals puts you at risk of toxic hepatitis 
Complications The inflammation associated with toxic hepatitis can lead to liver damage and scarring 
But you may reduce your risk of liver problems if you 
Don t exceed the recommended amount, even if your symptoms don t seem to improve 
Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor before taking herbs and supplements 
Most people with Wilson s disease are diagnosed between the ages of and 
You usually take in copper from the food you eat 
Your liver produces a substance called bile that removes any extra copper 
But in people with Wilson s disease, copper isn t removed properly and instead builds up 
Symptoms vary based on the parts of your body the disease affects 
A yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eye, known as jaundice 
Golden brown or copper colored rings around the irises of the eyes, known as Kayser Fleischer rings 
Causes Wilson s disease is caused by a changed gene passed down from each parent 
This means you could pass the affected gene to your children 
Diagnosing the condition as early as possible greatly increases the chances of successful treatment 
Complications If Wilson s disease isn t treated, sometimes it can lead to death 
This can occur suddenly what s known as acute liver failure or decompensated Wilson s disease 
But some people have lasting nervous system problems, even with treatment 
These might include personality changes, depression, irritability, bipolar disorder or psychosis 
These might include the destruction of red blood cells what s known as hemolysis 
This condition affects the lungs of people who have advanced liver disease 
Then the lungs can t send enough oxygen to the body 
This leads to low oxygen levels in the blood, also called hypoxemia 
How liver disease is linked to the lung condition isn t yet known 
A liver transplant is the only cure for hepatopulmonary syndrome 
Shortness of breath that s worse when sitting or standing and gets better when lying down 
Bluish tinge of the lips and skin in white people 
In Black and brown people, the lips or tongue might look light gray 
This affects the amount of oxygen that moves from the lungs into the bloodstream 
The most common locations affected are the nose, lungs, brain and liver 
These AVMs may enlarge over time and can bleed or rupture, sometimes causing catastrophic complications 
Spontaneous and unprovoked nosebleeds, sometimes on a daily basis, are the most common feature 
Its severity can vary greatly from person to person, even within the same family 
Nosebleeds, sometimes on a daily basis and often starting in childhood 
Causes HHT is a genetic disorder you inherit from your parents 
Overview Lynch syndrome is a condition that increases the risk of many kinds of cancer 
Families that have Lynch syndrome have more instances of cancer than expected 
This might include colon cancer, endometrial cancer and other types of cancer 
Lynch syndrome also causes cancers to happen at an earlier age 
People with Lynch syndrome may need careful testing to look for cancer when it s small 
Treatment is more likely to be successful when the cancer is caught early 
Some people with Lynch syndrome might consider treatments to prevent cancer 
Lynch syndrome used to be called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer HNPCC 
HNPCC is a term used to describe families with a strong history of colon cancer 
Cancer of the inside lining of the uterus endometrial cancer before age 
A personal history of more than one type of cancer 
Causes Lynch syndrome is caused by genes that are passed from parents to children 
People with Lynch syndrome have mismatch repair genes that don t work as expected 
If an error happens in the DNA, it might not get fixed 
This could cause cells that grow out of control and become cancer cells 
Lynch syndrome runs in families in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern 
Complications Knowing that you have Lynch syndrome can raise concerns about your health 
It may also raise some concerns about other parts of your life 
For instance, you might be concerned that your job or insurance companies might find out 
A genetics professional can explain the laws that may protect you 
If you have Lynch syndrome, your children have a risk of inheriting it from you 
Other blood relatives may have a chance of having Lynch syndrome 
In a hiatal hernia, the stomach pushes up through that opening and into the chest 
Backward flow of swallowed food or liquids into the mouth, called regurgitation 
Backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, called acid reflux 
Injury to the area, for example, after trauma or certain types of surgery 
Risk factors Hiatal hernias are most common in people who are 
It doesn t improve on its own, however, and can lead to life threatening complications 
Pain or discomfort in your groin, especially when bending over, coughing or lifting 
Occasionally, pain and swelling around the testicles when the protruding intestine descends into the scrotum 
He or she might be irritable and have less appetite than usual 
A strangulated hernia can be life threatening if it isn t treated 
Risk factors Factors that contribute to developing an inguinal hernia include 
Men are eight times more likely to develop an inguinal hernia than are women 
You have a close relative, such as a parent or sibling, who has the condition 
Being pregnant can weaken the abdominal muscles and cause increased pressure inside your abdomen 
Most inguinal hernias enlarge over time if not repaired surgically 
In men, large hernias can extend into the scrotum, causing pain and swelling 
An incarcerated hernia can cut off blood flow to part of your intestine 
Strangulation can lead to the death of the affected bowel tissue 
PreventionYou can t prevent the congenital defect that makes you susceptible to an inguinal hernia 
You can, however, reduce strain on your abdominal muscles and tissues 
Talk to your doctor about the best exercise and diet plan for you 
Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain fiber that can help prevent constipation and straining 
If you must lift something heavy, always bend from your knees not your waist 
Umbilical hernias are most common in infants, but they can affect adults as well 
Umbilical hernias that appear during adulthood are more likely to need surgical repair 
SymptomsAn umbilical hernia creates a soft swelling or bulge near the navel 
Umbilical hernias that appear during adulthood may cause abdominal discomfort 
Seek emergency care if your baby has an umbilical hernia and 
Has tenderness, swelling or discoloration at the site of the hernia 
Talk with your doctor if you have a bulge near your navel 
Seek emergency care if the bulge becomes painful or tender 
In adults, too much abdominal pressure contributes to umbilical hernias 
This type of hernia tends to be more common in women 
Complications For children, complications of an umbilical hernia are rare 
Infection may spread throughout the abdominal cavity, causing a life threatening situation 
Adults with umbilical hernias are somewhat more likely to experience a blockage of the intestines 
A spinal disk has a soft, jellylike center called a nucleus 
The nucleus is encased in a tougher, rubbery exterior, known as the annulus 
A herniated disk is sometimes called a slipped disk or a ruptured disk 
For people who do have symptoms, the symptoms tend to improve over time 
You might have pain in part of your foot as well 
This can cause you to stumble or affect your ability to lift or hold items 
You might not know you have it unless it shows up on a spinal image 
Most people can t pinpoint the cause of their herniated disk 
Twisting and turning while lifting also can cause a herniated disk 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of a herniated disk include 
Excess body weight causes extra stress on the disks in the lower back 
People with physically demanding jobs have a greater risk of back problems 
Some people inherit a predisposition to developing a herniated disk 
In rare instances, emergency surgery might be needed to avoid permanent weakness or paralysis 
Pain, numbness or weakness can increase to the point that they hamper your daily activities 
Cauda equina syndrome can cause incontinence or trouble urinating even with a full bladder 
Keep your back straight and aligned, particularly when sitting for long periods 
Shingles Overview Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash 
Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus the same virus that causes chickenpox 
Early treatment may shorten a shingles infection and lessen the chance of complications 
SymptomsShingles symptoms usually affect only a small section on one side of your body 
A red rash that begins a few days after the pain 
Some people experience shingles pain without ever developing the rash 
If left untreated, this infection may lead to permanent eye damage 
You or someone in your family has a weakened immune system 
This may be due to cancer, medications or chronic illness 
Causes Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus the same virus that causes chickenpox 
Sometimes the virus reactivates and travels along nerve pathways to your skin producing shingles 
It may be due to lowered immunity to infections as people get older 
Shingles is more common in older adults and in people who have weakened immune systems 
Varicella zoster is part of a group of viruses called herpes viruses 
As a result, shingles is also known as herpes zoster 
This usually occurs through direct contact with the open sores of the shingles rash 
Once infected, though, the person will develop chickenpox rather than shingles 
Avoid physical contact with anyone who hasn t yet had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine 
That includes people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and newborns 
Risk factors Anyone who has ever had chickenpox can develop shingles 
Most adults in the United States had chickenpox when they were children 
That was before the availability of the routine childhood vaccination that now protects against chickenpox 
Factors that may increase your risk of developing shingles include 
And people over the age of are more likely to experience more severe complications 
Radiation or chemotherapy can lower your resistance to diseases and may trigger shingles 
Drugs that prevent rejection of transplanted organs can increase your risk of shingles 
Long term use of steroids, such as prednisone, may also increase your risk of developing shingles 
For some people, shingles pain continues long after the blisters have cleared 
If shingles blisters aren t properly treated, bacterial skin infections may develop 
Shingrix is a nonliving vaccine made of a virus component 
It s given in two doses, with to months between doses 
Some people also experience fatigue, headache and other side effects 
The shingles vaccine doesn t guarantee that you won t get shingles 
But this vaccine will likely reduce the course and severity of the disease 
And it will likely lower your risk of postherpetic neuralgia 
Studies suggest that Shingrix offers protection against shingles for more than five years 
Talk to your health care provider about your vaccination options if you 
Have had an allergic reaction to any component of the shingles vaccine 
Have a weakened immune system due to a condition or medication 
The shingles vaccine is used only as a way to prevent shingles 
It s not intended to treat people who currently have the disease 
Ramsay Hunt syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox 
After chickenpox clears up, the virus still lives in your nerves 
SymptomsThe two main signs and symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome are 
A painful red rash with fluid filled blisters on, in and around one ear 
Facial weakness or paralysis on the same side as the affected ear 
Usually, the rash and the facial paralysis occur at the same time 
If you have Ramsay Hunt syndrome, you might also experience 
Causes Ramsay Hunt syndrome occurs in people who ve had chickenpox 
It can also causes one sided facial paralysis and hearing loss 
Risk factors Ramsay Hunt syndrome can occur in anyone who has had chickenpox 
It s more common in older adults, typically affecting people older than 
The infection can be serious for people who have immune system problems 
Until the rash blisters scab over, avoid physical contact with 
Anyone who s never had chickenpox or who s never had the chickenpox vaccine 
Complications Complications of Ramsay Hunt syndrome may include 
When this happens, the cornea, which protects your eye, can become damaged 
This painful condition occurs when a shingles infection damages nerve fibers 
A shingles vaccine for people age or older also is recommended 
Overview Hiccups are repeated spasms or sudden movements of the diaphragm that you can t control 
In some cases, hiccups may be a sign of an underlying medical issue 
For most people, hiccups usually last only a few minutes 
When they last that long, they can result in weight loss and extreme tiredness 
SymptomsSymptoms include uncontrolled spasms in your diaphragm and a hic sound 
Sometimes you may feel a slight tightening sensation in your chest, stomach area or throat 
Causes The most common triggers for hiccups that last less than hours include 
A hair or something else in your ear touching your eardrum 
A tumor, cyst or growth on the thyroid gland in your neck 
Inflammation of the brain, which also is known as encephalitis 
Metabolic issuesLong term hiccups may result when your body s metabolism doesn t work properly 
Risk factors Males are much more likely to develop long term hiccups than females 
Other factors that may increase your risk of hiccups include 
Anxiety, stress and excitement have been linked with some cases of hiccups 
Complications Ongoing hiccups may interfere with eating, drinking, sleeping and speaking 
High blood pressure hypertension Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Hg and the bottom number is below, not above, mm Hg 
Hg or the bottom number is between and mm 
Seek emergency medical help for anyone with these blood pressure numbers 
You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms 
They usually don t occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life threatening stage 
When to see a doctorBlood pressure screening is an important part of general health care 
Free blood pressure machines are also available in some stores and pharmacies 
Ask your health care provider for advice on using public blood pressure machines 
This type of high blood pressure is called primary hypertension or essential hypertension 
Plaque buildup in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, increases the risk of high blood pressure 
Secondary hypertensionThis type of high blood pressure is caused by an underlying condition 
It tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension 
Conditions and medicines that can lead to secondary hypertension include 
Blood vessel problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects 
Cough and cold medicines, some pain relievers, birth control pills, and other prescription drugs 
Sometimes just getting a health checkup causes blood pressure to increase 
Risk factors High blood pressure has many risk factors, including 
Until about age , high blood pressure is more common in men 
Women are more likely to develop high blood pressure after age 
It develops at an earlier age in Black people than it does in white people 
People who are inactive also tend to have higher heart rates 
Smoking, chewing tobacco or vaping immediately raises blood pressure for a short while 
If you smoke, ask your care provider for strategies to help you quit 
Potassium helps balance the amount of salt in the body s cells 
A proper balance of potassium is important for good heart health 
Alcohol use has been linked with increased blood pressure, particularly in men 
High levels of stress can lead to a temporary increase in blood pressure 
High blood pressure in children may be caused by problems with the kidneys or heart 
The higher the blood pressure and the longer it goes uncontrolled, the greater the damage 
Increased blood pressure can cause a blood vessel to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm 
When you have high blood pressure, the heart has to work harder to pump blood 
The strain causes the walls of the heart s pumping chamber to thicken 
Eventually, the heart can t pump enough blood to meet the body s needs, causing heart failure 
Increased blood pressure can cause thickened, narrowed or torn blood vessels in the eyes 
This syndrome is a group of disorders of the body s metabolism 
It involves the irregular breakdown of sugar, also called glucose 
These conditions make you more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and stroke 
Uncontrolled high blood pressure may affect the ability to think, remember and learn 
Narrowed or blocked arteries can limit blood flow to the brain 
This can cause a certain type of dementia called vascular dementia 
A stroke that interrupts blood flow to the brain also can cause vascular dementia 
High blood pressure in children Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
However, signs and symptoms that might indicate a high blood pressure emergency hypertensive crisis include 
If your child has any of these signs or symptoms, seek emergency medical care 
This type of high blood pressure occurs on its own, without an underlying condition 
Primary essential hypertensionPrimary hypertension occurs on its own, without an identifiable cause 
This type of high blood pressure occurs more often in children age and older 
Having type diabetes or a high fasting blood sugar level 
Heart problems, such as severe narrowing coarctation of the aorta 
Narrowing of the artery to the kidney renal artery stenosis 
It can be caused by conditions that affect the kidneys, arteries, heart or endocrine system 
High blood pressure that doesn t respond to blood pressure medications resistant hypertension 
High blood pressure that no longer responds to medication that previously controlled the blood pressure 
Sudden onset high blood pressure before age or after age 
Ask your health care provider how often to have your blood pressure checked 
Diabetes can damage the kidneys filtering system, which can lead to high blood pressure 
Kidneys remove waste and sodium using tiny filters called glomeruli 
Medical conditions affecting hormone levels also may cause secondary hypertension 
The adrenal glands produce too much of the hormone aldosterone 
The parathyroid glands control levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body 
In this condition, present at birth, the body s main artery aorta is narrowed coarctation 
As a result, blood pressure increases particularly in the arms 
As body weight increases, the amount of blood flowing through the body increases 
This increase in blood flow puts added pressure on artery walls, increasing blood pressure 
In addition, fat deposits can release chemicals that raise blood pressure 
Many illegal drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, also increase blood pressure 
Complications Secondary hypertension can worsen the underlying medical condition that s causing the high blood pressure 
Without treatment, secondary hypertension can lead to other health problems, such as 
Increased blood pressure can cause blood vessels to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm 
To pump blood against the higher pressure in the vessels, the heart muscle thickens 
Uncontrolled high blood pressure also may affect the ability to think, remember and learn 
Overview Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in your blood 
With high cholesterol, you can develop fatty deposits in your blood vessels 
Eventually, these deposits grow, making it difficult for enough blood to flow through your arteries 
A healthy diet, regular exercise and sometimes medication can help reduce high cholesterol 
A blood test is the only way to detect if you have it 
If your test results aren t within desirable ranges, your doctor might recommend more frequent measurements 
Causes Cholesterol is carried through your blood, attached to proteins 
This combination of proteins and cholesterol is called a lipoprotein 
There are different types of cholesterol, based on what the lipoprotein carries 
LDL, the bad cholesterol, transports cholesterol particles throughout your body 
LDL cholesterol builds up in the walls of your arteries, making them hard and narrow 
HDL, the good cholesterol, picks up excess cholesterol and takes it back to your liver 
A lipid profile also typically measures triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood 
Having a high triglyceride level also can increase your risk of heart disease 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of unhealthy cholesterol levels include 
Eating too much saturated fat or trans fats can result in unhealthy cholesterol levels 
Saturated fats are found in fatty cuts of meat and full fat dairy products 
Trans fats are often found in packaged snacks or desserts 
Cigarette smoking may lower your level of HDL, the good, cholesterol 
Drinking too much alcohol can increase your total cholesterol level 
As you age, your liver becomes less able to remove LDL cholesterol 
If blood flow to part of your heart stops, you ll have a heart attack 
Eat a low salt diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
Limit the amount of animal fats and use good fats in moderation 
Exercise on most days of the week for at least minutes 
Priapism Overview Priapism is a prolonged erection of the penis 
The full or partial erection continues hours beyond or isn t caused by sexual stimulation 
The two main types of priapism are ischemic priapism and nonischemic priapism 
Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation 
Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis glans is soft 
Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis 
However, the penile tissues continue to receive some blood flow and oxygen 
The emergency room doctor will determine whether you have ischemic priapism or nonischemic priapism 
If you experience recurrent, persistent, painful erections that resolve on their own, see your doctor 
Causes An erection normally occurs in response to physical or psychological stimulation 
Other blood diseases hematologic dyscrasias , such as thalassemia and multiple myeloma 
The most common associated diagnosis in children is sickle cell disease 
Antidepressants, such as fluoxetine Prozac , bupropion Wellbutrin XL, Wellbutrin SR , trazodone and sertraline Zoloft 
Alpha blockers including prazosin Minipress , terazosin, doxazosin Cardura and tamsulosin Flomax 
Alcohol and drug useAlcohol, marijuana, cocaine and other drugs can cause priapism, particularly ischemic priapism 
Neurogenic disorders, such as a spinal cord injury or syphilis 
The blood trapped in the penis is deprived of oxygen 
PreventionIf you have stuttering priapism, to prevent future episodes your doctor might recommend 
Treatment for an underlying condition, such as sickle cell disease, that might have caused priapism 
Imaging tests, such as computerized tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI 
Blood test for very high levels of the CA tumor marker 
Liver transplantSome people with early stage hilar cholangiocarcinoma may consider liver transplant 
Intravenous chemotherapy with a medicine that makes your cells more vulnerable to radiation 
Minimally invasive surgery to look for signs that cancer has spread 
Liver transplant with a donor liver if one becomes available 
Hip labral tear Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Structural problems of the hip also can lead to a hip labral tear 
Some people, however, have one or more of the following 
A locking, clicking or catching sensation in the hip joint 
Stiffness or limited range of motion in the hip joint 
Causes The cause of a hip labral tear might be 
In the United States, histoplasmosis commonly occurs in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys 
It also occurs in Africa, Asia, Australia, and in parts of Central and South America 
Most people with histoplasmosis never develop symptoms and aren t aware they re infected 
Treatments are available for even the most severe forms of histoplasmosis 
SymptomsThe mildest forms of histoplasmosis cause no signs or symptoms 
Some people with histoplasmosis also get joint pain and a rash 
People who have a lung disease, such as emphysema, can develop chronic histoplasmosis 
Signs of chronic histoplasmosis can include weight loss and a bloody cough 
Causes Histoplasmosis is caused by the reproductive cells spores of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum 
They float into the air when dirt or other material is disturbed 
It s particularly common in chicken and pigeon coops, old barns, caves, and parks 
Histoplasmosis isn t contagious, so it can t be spread from person to person 
Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, often used to control rheumatoid arthritis 
Complications Histoplasmosis can cause many serious complications, even in otherwise healthy people 
Histoplasmosis can damage lungs to the point that the air sacs begin filling with fluid 
This prevents good air exchange and can deplete the oxygen in your blood 
Inflammation of the sac that surrounds your heart pericardium is called pericarditis 
But taking the following steps might help reduce the risk of infection 
This can help prevent spores from being released into the air 
Spraying chicken coops and barns before cleaning them also can reduce your risk 
Normally, your vocal cords open and close smoothly, forming sounds through their movement and vibration 
But with laryngitis, your vocal cords become inflamed or irritated 
In some cases of laryngitis, your voice can become almost undetectable 
Most cases of laryngitis are triggered by a temporary viral infection and aren t serious 
Persistent hoarseness can sometimes signal a more serious underlying medical condition 
Less often, laryngitis symptoms are caused by something more serious or long lasting 
Make an appointment with a doctor if your laryngitis symptoms last more than two weeks 
Although croup can usually be treated at home, severe symptoms require medical attention 
Chronic laryngitisLaryngitis that lasts longer than three weeks is known as chronic laryngitis 
This type of laryngitis is generally caused by exposure to irritants over time 
Habitual overuse of your voice such as in singers or cheerleaders 
Risk factors Risk factors for laryngitis include 
Having a respiratory infection, such as a cold, bronchitis or sinusitis 
Overusing your voice, by speaking too much, speaking too loudly, shouting or singing 
It can also cause your vocal cords to become irritated 
Fluids help keep the mucus in your throat thin and easy to clear 
Spicy foods can cause stomach acid to go into the throat or esophagus 
This can lead to heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD 
These foods can also help keep the mucous membranes in the throat healthy 
A red lump on your eyelid that is similar to a boil or a pimple 
Another condition that causes inflammation of the eyelid is a chalazion 
Causes A stye is caused by an infection of oil glands in the eyelid 
The bacterium staphylococcus is commonly responsible for most of these infections 
Risk factors You are at increased risk of a stye if you 
Insert your contact lenses without thoroughly disinfecting them or washing your hands first 
Have blepharitis, a chronic inflammation along the edge of the eyelid 
Reduce your risk of recurrent eye infections by throwing away old cosmetics 
If you have blepharitis, follow your doctor s instructions for caring for your eyes 
Horner syndrome is also known as Bernard Horner syndrome or oculosympathetic palsy 
SymptomsHorner syndrome usually affects only one side of the face 
A notable difference in pupil size between the two eyes anisocoria 
Little or delayed opening dilation of the affected pupil in dim light 
Slight elevation of the lower lid, sometimes called upside down ptosis 
Little or no sweating anhidrosis on the affected side of the face 
Signs and symptoms, particularly ptosis and anhidrosis, may be subtle and difficult to detect 
ChildrenAdditional signs and symptoms in children with Horner syndrome may include 
Lighter iris color in the affected eye of a child under the age of 
It is important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis 
Problems in this region that can disrupt nerve function related to Horner syndrome include 
Diseases that cause the loss of the protective sheath on neurons myelin 
Causes related to nerve damage in this region may include 
Damage to the main blood vessel leading from the heart aorta 
Nerve damage in this region may be associated with the following 
Damage to the carotid artery along the side of the neck 
Damage to the jugular vein along the side of the neck 
Cluster headaches, a disorder that results in cyclical patterns of severe headaches 
ChildrenThe most common causes of Horner syndrome in children include 
Unknown causesIn some cases, the cause of Horner syndrome cannot be identified 
If you lose too much body heat, you might feel chilled afterward 
Night sweats are hot flashes that happen at night, and they may disrupt your sleep 
In fact, hot flashes are the most common symptom of the menopausal transition 
There are a variety of treatments for bothersome hot flashes 
A sudden feeling of warmth spreading through your chest, neck and face 
The frequency and intensity of hot flashes vary among women 
Hot flashes may be mild or so intense that they disrupt daily activities 
They can happen at any time of day or night 
On average, hot flash symptoms persist for more than seven years 
It s not clear exactly how hormonal changes cause hot flashes 
Rarely, hot flashes and nights sweats are caused by something other than menopause 
Women who smoke are more likely to get hot flashes 
A high body mass index BMI is associated with a higher frequency of hot flashes 
More black women report having hot flashes during menopause than do women of other races 
Complications Hot flashes may impact your daily activities and quality of life 
There are more than varieties of human papillomavirus HPV 
These infections are often transmitted sexually or through other skin to skin contact 
SymptomsIn most cases, your body s immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts 
These appear as flat lesions, small cauliflower like bumps or tiny stemlike protrusions 
In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus 
Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender 
Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps and usually occur on the hands and fingers 
The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don t cause noticeable symptoms 
Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is your best protection from cervical cancer 
Warts can also spread when someone touches something that already touched a wart 
Having sex with a partner who has had multiple sex partners also increases your risk 
Genital warts occur most often in adolescents and young adults 
People who have weakened immune systems are at greater risk of HPV infections 
PreventionCommon wartsIt s difficult to prevent HPV infections that cause common warts 
Using a latex condom, which can reduce your risk of HPV transmission 
Also, response to the vaccine is better at younger ages than older ones 
Overview Kyphosis is an exaggerated, forward rounding of the upper back 
Treatment for kyphosis depends on your age, and the cause and effects of the curvature 
In fact, the upper back naturally has a little kyphosis 
People who have excessive curvature may experience back pain and stiffness 
Kyphosis occurs when the vertebrae in the back become more wedge shaped 
Compression fractures, which can occur in weakened bone, are the most common 
Mild compression fractures often don t produce noticeable signs or symptoms 
Weak bones can cause spinal curvature, especially if weakened vertebrae develop compression fractures 
With age, these disks flatten and shrink, which often worsens kyphosis 
Spinal bones that don t develop properly before birth can cause kyphosis 
Kyphosis in children can also be associated with certain medical conditions, such as Ehlers Danlos syndrome 
People with kyphosis, especially adolescents, may have poor body image from having a rounded back 
It causes children to age rapidly, starting in their first two years of life 
Heart problems or strokes are the eventual cause of death in most children with progeria 
The average life expectancy for a child with progeria is about years 
SymptomsUsually within the first year of life, you ll notice that your child s growth has slowed 
Slowed growth and poor weight gain, with below average height and weight 
Severe progressive heart and blood vessel disease, also known as cardiovascular disease 
Delayed tooth formation and tooth shape that is not usual 
Loss of fat under the skin and loss of muscle 
A hip that s forced out of the correct position, known as hip dislocation 
When to see a doctorProgeria is usually found in infancy or early childhood 
Progerin makes cells unstable and appears to lead to progeria s aging process 
The changed gene that causes progeria is rarely passed down in families 
In most cases, the rare gene change that causes progeria happens by chance 
Other similar syndromesThere are other syndromes that may include problems with progerin like proteins 
The changed genes that cause these syndromes are passed down in families 
Werner syndrome, also known as adult progeria, begins in the teen years or early adulthood 
But the age of the father has been described as a possible risk factor 
Complications Severe hardening of the arteries, known as atherosclerosis, is common in progeria 
Atherosclerosis is a condition in which the walls of the arteries stiffen and thicken 
The condition especially affects arteries in the heart and brain 
Most children with progeria die of complications related to atherosclerosis, including 
Problems with blood vessels that supply the brain, resulting in stroke 
This swelling happens when fluid collects in the thin sac that surrounds a testicle 
But it s important to see a health care provider if the scrotum looks swollen 
It needs to be treated within hours of the symptoms starting to save the testicle 
Typically, the testicles descend from the developing baby s stomach area into the scrotum 
A sac comes with each testicle, letting fluid surround the testicles 
Most often, each sac closes and the fluid is absorbed 
The fluid usually is absorbed by age or 
The sac can change size, or fluid can flow back into the stomach area 
Or it can form because of a type of swelling, called inflammation, within the scrotum 
Risk factors for getting a hydrocele later in life include 
But a hydrocele might be linked with a health problem that can cause serious issues 
Overview Hydrocephalus is the buildup of fluid in cavities called ventricles deep within the brain 
The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain 
Cerebrospinal fluid usually flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column 
Surgery can restore and maintain healthy cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain 
A rapid increase in the size of an infant s head 
A bulge or tense soft spot on the top of the head 
Older adultsAmong adults and older, the more common symptoms of hydrocephalus are 
Trouble walking, often described as shuffling or the feeling of the feet being stuck 
Risk factors Much of the time, the cause of hydrocephalus is not known 
However, developmental or medical problems can contribute to or trigger hydrocephalus 
Other contributing factorsOther factors that can contribute to hydrocephalus among any age group include 
Central nervous system infections, such as bacterial meningitis or mumps 
Bleeding in the brain from a stroke or head injury 
When they occur, signs and symptoms of hydronephrosis might include 
Pain in the side and back that may travel to the lower abdomen or groin 
But, sometimes urine backs up or remains inside the kidney or in the ureter 
Urinary tract blockages often form where the kidney meets the ureter 
Less commonly, blockages may occur where the ureter meets the bladder 
Although surgery is sometimes needed, hydronephrosis often resolves on its own 
Left untreated, severe hydronephrosis can lead to permanent kidney damage 
Too much calcium in the blood can weaken bones and create kidney stones 
These four tiny glands are in the neck, near the thyroid gland 
Other causes of hypercalcemia include cancer, certain other medical conditions and some medicines 
Taking too much of calcium and vitamin D supplements also can cause hypercalcemia 
SymptomsYou might not have any symptoms if your hypercalcemia is mild 
Excess calcium makes the kidneys work harder to filter it 
Hypercalcemia can cause stomach upset or pain, vomiting, and constipation 
Most often, the extra calcium in the blood is leached from the bones 
That can lead to trouble focusing, confusion, drowsiness and fatigue 
It can cause feelings of a fast beating, fluttering or pounding heart 
It also can cause the heart to beat out of rhythm 
These can include extreme thirst, frequent urination and pain in the stomach area 
The condition can stem from a small tumor that isn t cancer 
It also can stem from one or more of the four parathyroid glands becoming larger 
Lung cancer, breast cancer and some blood cancers can raise the risk of hypercalcemia 
Cancer that spreads to the bones also raises the risk 
Over time, bones that don t bear weight release calcium into the blood 
This is a common cause of mild or short term hypercalcemia 
Having less fluid in the blood causes a rise in calcium 
Medicines such as lithium and thiazide diuretics might cause more parathyroid hormone to be released 
It could develop if the bones keep releasing calcium into the blood 
Osteoporosis can lead to broken bones, curving of the spinal column and loss of height 
If the urine contains too much calcium, crystals might form in the kidneys 
Over time, the crystals can combine to form kidney stones 
It can develop over time as hypercalcemia damages the kidneys 
Hypercalcemia can affect the electrical signals that control the heartbeat 
That can cause the heart to beat out of rhythm 
Over time, the excess eosinophils enter various tissues, eventually damaging your organs 
The most common targets are the skin, lungs, digestive tract, heart, blood and nervous system 
SymptomsEarly symptoms of HES may include fatigue, cough, breathlessness, muscle pain, rash and fever 
Causes Some varieties of hypereosinophilic syndrome tend to run in families 
Other types have been associated with certain types of cancers, infections or other health problems 
But it occurs more often in men, usually between the ages of and 
Hyperglycemia in diabetes Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Hyperglycemia in diabetes Overview High blood sugar, also called hyperglycemia, affects people who have diabetes 
Several factors can play a role in hyperglycemia in people with diabetes 
They include food and physical activity, illness, and medications not related to diabetes 
The longer blood sugar levels stay high, the more serious symptoms may become 
When to see a doctorSeek immediate help from your care provider or call if 
You have ongoing diarrhea or vomiting, and you can t keep any food or fluids down 
When the glucose level in the blood rises, the pancreas releases insulin 
The insulin unlocks the cells so that glucose can enter 
This provides the fuel the cells need to work properly 
In people who have diabetes, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream 
It may reach dangerously high levels if it is not treated properly 
Insulin and other drugs are used to lower blood sugar levels 
Risk factors Many factors can contribute to hyperglycemia, including 
Experiencing emotional stress, such as family problems or workplace issues 
Complications Long term complicationsKeeping blood sugar in a healthy range can help prevent many diabetes related complications 
Damage to the blood vessels of the retina diabetic retinopathy that could lead to blindness 
This condition develops when you don t have enough insulin in your body 
When this happens, glucose can t enter your cells for energy 
Your blood sugar level rises, and your body begins to break down fat for energy 
Ketones accumulate in the blood and eventually spill into the urine 
This condition occurs when the body makes insulin, but the insulin doesn t work properly 
If you develop this condition, your body can t use either glucose or fat for energy 
If it isn t treated, diabetic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state can lead to life threatening dehydration and coma 
It s very important to get medical care for it right away 
PreventionTo help keep your blood sugar within a healthy range 
The food you eat must be in balance with the insulin working in your body 
Note when your glucose readings are above or below your target range 
Carefully follow your health care provider s directions for how to take your medication

Overview Hyperoxaluria hi pur ok suh LU ree uh happens when you have too much oxalate in your urine 
But too much oxalate in the urine can cause serious problems 
This can lead to oxalate buildups in blood vessels, bones and organs 
SymptomsOften, the first sign of hyperoxaluria is a kidney stone 
Sharp pain in the back, side, lower stomach area or groin 
Urine that looks pink, red or brown due to blood 
Not being able to urinate or peeing only a small amount 
When to see a doctorIt s not common for children to get kidney stones 
All young people with kidney stones should have a checkup 
The checkup should include a test that measures oxalate in the urine 
Adults who keep getting kidney stones also should be tested for oxalate in the urine 
This type is a rare inherited disease, which means that it s passed down in families 
The body gets rid of excess oxalate through the kidneys, in urine 
The extra oxalate can combine with calcium to form kidney stones and crystals 
These can damage the kidneys and cause them to stop working 
They most often cause symptoms from childhood through age 
But kidney failure can happen even in babies with this disease 
Some intestine problems cause the body to absorb more oxalate from foods 
This can then increase the amount of oxalate in the urine 
Crohn s disease is one intestine problem that can lead to enteric hyperoxaluria 
Other health problems make it hard for the small intestine to absorb fats from food 
If this happens, it might leave oxalate more available for the gut to absorb 
Usually, oxalate combines with calcium in the gut and exits the body through stools 
But when there is increased fat in the gut, calcium binds to the fat instead 
This allows oxalate to be free in the gut and absorbed in the bloodstream 
These foods include nuts, chocolate, brewed tea, spinach, potatoes, beets and rhubarb 
It s important to stay away from high oxalate foods if you have diet related or enteric hyperoxaluria 
Your doctor also may tell you to limit these foods if you have primary hyperoxaluria 
For some people, this is the first sign of the disease 
Oxalosis can cause many health problems outside the kidneys in its late stages 
This is especially important for nerve and muscle function, as well as bone health 
This is common in kidney disease and after certain intestinal surgeries or diseases 
SymptomsPrimary hyperparathyroidism is often diagnosed before signs or symptoms of the disorder occur 
This is usually because an elevated level of calcium is found on routine blood tests 
These symptoms could be caused by many disorders, including some with serious complications 
It s important to get a prompt, accurate diagnosis and the right treatment 
Causes Hyperparathyroidism is caused by factors that increase the production of parathyroid hormone 
Vitamin D also is involved in controlling the amount of calcium in your blood 
When blood calcium levels are too high, the parathyroid glands produce less parathyroid hormone 
Calcium is best known for its role in keeping your teeth and bones healthy 
But calcium also aids in the transmission of signals in nerve cells 
Phosphorus, another mineral, works along with calcium in these areas 
Sometimes one or more of the parathyroid glands produce high amounts of parathyroid hormone 
Hyperparathyroidism may occur because of primary hyperparathyroidism or secondary hyperparathyroidism 
A noncancerous growth adenoma on a gland is the most common cause 
Enlargement hyperplasia of two or more parathyroid glands accounts for most other cases 
A cancerous tumor is a very rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism 
One or more of the parathyroid glands produces high amounts of parathyroid hormone 
This leads to high calcium levels and low phosphorus levels in your blood 
But some people inherit a gene that causes the disorder 
This is common after intestinal surgery, including weight loss surgery 
Vitamin D helps maintain appropriate calcium levels in the blood 
It also helps your digestive system absorb calcium from your food 
Your body produces vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight 
If you don t get enough vitamin D, then calcium levels may drop 
Your kidneys convert vitamin D into a form that your body can use 
If your kidneys work poorly, usable vitamin D may decrease and calcium levels drop 
Chronic kidney failure is the most common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism 
Risk factors You may be at an increased risk of primary hyperparathyroidism if you 
Have had radiation treatment for cancer that has exposed your neck to radiation 
Have taken lithium, a drug most often used to treat bipolar disorder 
Too much calcium in your blood may lead to too much calcium in your urine 
Severe, untreated hyperparathyroidism in pregnant women may cause dangerously low levels of calcium in newborns 
Primary hyperparathyroidism is not common in women of childbearing age 
Preeclampsia may develop after delivery of a baby, a condition known as postpartum preeclampsia 
Along with high blood pressure, preeclampsia signs and symptoms may include 
Excess protein in urine proteinuria or other signs of kidney problems 
Changes in vision, including temporary loss of vision, blurred vision or light sensitivity 
Pain in the upper belly, usually under the ribs on the right side 
Weight gain and swelling edema are typical during healthy pregnancies 
Causes The exact cause of preeclampsia likely involves several factors 
In women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don t seem to develop or work properly 
Risk factors Conditions that are linked to a higher risk of preeclampsia include 
Conditions that are associated with a moderate risk of developing preeclampsia include 
There s also some evidence of an increased risk among indigenous women in North America 
This can lead to slow growth known as fetal growth restriction 
Preeclampsia may lead to an unplanned preterm birth delivery before weeks 
Also, planned preterm birth is a primary treatment for preeclampsia 
With this condition, the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery 
hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count HELLP syndrome 
Sometimes, it develops suddenly, even before high blood pressure is detected 
Eclampsia is the onset of seizures or coma with signs or symptoms of preeclampsia 
It is very difficult to predict whether a patient with preeclampsia will develop eclampsia 
Eclampsia can happen without any previously observed signs or symptoms of preeclampsia 
The amount of injury to other organs depends on how severe the preeclampsia is 
Having preeclampsia may increase your risk of future heart and blood vessel cardiovascular disease 
PreventionMedicationThe best clinical evidence for prevention of preeclampsia is the use of low dose aspirin 
Talk to your provider about managing any conditions that increase the risk of preeclampsia 
The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs 
The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail 
In some people, pulmonary hypertension slowly gets worse and can be life threatening 
You may not notice them for months or even years 
Shortness of breath, at first while exercising and eventually while at rest 
Depending on your skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see 
Shortness of breath is the most common symptom of pulmonary hypertension 
But it may be caused by other health conditions such as asthma 
Causes The typical heart has two upper chambers and two lower chambers 
The blood passes through a large blood vessel called the pulmonary artery 
These blood vessels are the pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins 
These changes may slow down or stop blood flow through the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension 
Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause 
Changes in a gene passed down through families, called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Heart problems present at birth, called a congenital heart defect 
Other health conditions, including scleroderma, lupus and chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis 
Left sided heart valve disease such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease 
Group Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease Causes include 
Group Pulmonary hypertension triggered by other health conditions Causes include 
It can occur with unrepaired holes between the heart chambers 
The hole in the heart causes blood to flow incorrectly in the heart 
This increases the blood flow and pressure in the pulmonary arteries, causing pulmonary hypertension 
Risk factors Pulmonary hypertension is usually diagnosed in people ages to 
PAH from an unknown cause is more common in younger adults 
Other things that can raise the risk of pulmonary hypertension are 
Blood clotting disorders or a family history of blood clots in the lungs 
A heart problem that you re born with, called a congenital heart defect 
Also called cor pulmonale, this condition causes the heart s right lower chamber to get larger 
The right lower heart chamber stretches to increase the amount of blood it can hold 
Pulmonary hypertension can cause changes in the heartbeat, called arrhythmias, which can be life threatening 
Pulmonary hypertension can lead to life threatening bleeding into the lungs and coughing up blood 
Pulmonary hypertension can be life threatening for the mother and the developing baby 
Overview Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone 
Sometimes, hyperthyroidism treatment includes surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland 
Tremor, usually a small trembling in the hands and fingers 
Older adults are more likely to have symptoms that are hard to notice 
Tell your provider about all the symptoms you ve noticed even if they are minor 
Causes Hyperthyroidism can be caused by several medical conditions that affect the thyroid gland 
The thyroid is a small, butterfly shaped gland at the base of the neck 
Every part of metabolism is controlled by hormones that the thyroid gland makes 
The thyroid gland produces two main hormones thyroxine T and triiodothyronine T 
They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates 
And they help control how much protein the body makes 
That prompts the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone 
This condition also is called toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter and Plummer disease 
This form of hyperthyroidism happens when a thyroid adenoma makes too much thyroid hormone 
It forms noncancerous lumps that can make the thyroid bigger than usual 
Risk factors Risk factors for hyperthyroidism include 
A personal history of certain chronic illnesses, including pernicious anemia and primary adrenal insufficiency 
A recent pregnancy, which raises the risk of developing thyroiditis 
Heart problemsSome of the most serious complications of hyperthyroidism involve the heart, including 
A heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke 
Too much thyroid hormone makes it hard for the body to get calcium into bones 
Vision problemsSome people with hyperthyroidism develop a problem called thyroid eye disease 
This disorder affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes 
Discolored, swollen skinIn rare cases, people with Graves disease develop Graves dermopathy 
This causes the skin to change colors and swell, often on the shins and feet 
Overview Women s levels of sexual desire change over the years 
Or they can happen with major life changes such as pregnancy, menopause or illness 
You may have a treatable condition called sexual interest arousal disorder 
But you don t have to meet this medical definition to seek help 
Lifestyle changes and sexual techniques may put you in the mood more often 
Bottom line There is no magic number to define low sex drive 
Having less or no interest in any type of sexual activity, including masturbation 
Being sad or concerned about your lack of sexual activity or fantasies 
The answer might be as simple as changing a medicine that you take 
Physical causesA variety of illnesses, physical changes and medicines can cause low sex drive, including 
These include cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease and neurological diseases 
Exhaustion from caring for young children or aging parents can contribute to low sex drive 
Fatigue from illness or surgery also can play a role 
Hormone changesChanges in your hormone levels may alter your desire for sex 
Many women still have satisfying sex during menopause and beyond 
But some have a lagging libido during this hormone change 
Fatigue and changes in body image can affect your sexual desire 
So can the pressures of pregnancy or caring for a new baby 
Psychological causesYour state of mind can affect your sexual desire 
Stress tied to things such as finances, relationships or work 
Relationship issuesFor many people, emotional closeness is a key to sexual intimacy 
So problems in your relationship can be a major factor in low sex drive 
Often, less interest in sex is a result of ongoing issues such as 
Risk factors Factors that can raise the risk of low sex drive include 
Conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and coronary artery disease 
Mental health conditions and life circumstances that affect your state of mind 
Various prescription medicines, including depression medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
Long term treatment requires identifying and treating the cause of hypoglycemia 
SymptomsIf blood sugar levels become too low, hypoglycemia signs and symptoms can include 
You have what might be hypoglycemia symptoms and you don t have diabetes 
Blood sugar regulationWhen you eat, your body breaks down foods into glucose 
Insulin allows the glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need 
Extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen 
This keeps your blood sugar within a standard range until you eat again 
This process occurs mainly in your liver, but also in your kidneys 
As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream and can reach dangerously high levels 
Possible causes, without diabetesHypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common 
Taking someone else s oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia 
Other medications can cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure 
Kidney disorders also can keep your body from properly excreting medications 
Other tumors also can result in too much production of insulin like substances 
Children can have hypoglycemia if they have too little growth hormone 
Hypoglycemia after mealsHypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven t eaten, but not always 
Sometimes hypoglycemia symptoms occur after certain meals, but exactly why this happens is uncertain 
Hypoglycemia unawarenessOver time, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can lead to hypoglycemia unawareness 
When this happens, the risk of severe, life threatening hypoglycemia increases 
A continuous glucose monitor CGM is an option for some people with hypoglycemia unawareness 
The device can alert you when your blood sugar is too low 
Learn the signs and symptoms you experience with low blood sugar 
This can help you identify and treat hypoglycemia before it gets too low 
A continuous glucose monitor CGM is a good option for some people 
Work with your health care provider to identify and treat the cause of hypoglycemia 
Overview Hyponatremia occurs when the concentration of sodium in your blood is abnormally low 
When this happens, your body s water levels rise, and your cells begin to swell 
This swelling can cause many health problems, from mild to life threatening 
In other cases of hyponatremia, you may need intravenous electrolyte solutions and medications 
A normal blood sodium level is between and milliequivalents per liter mEq L 
Hyponatremia occurs when the sodium in your blood falls below mEq L 
Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors can lead to hyponatremia, including 
Chronic, severe vomiting or diarrhea and other causes of dehydration 
This causes your body to lose electrolytes, such as sodium, and also increases ADH levels 
Low levels of thyroid hormone also can cause a low blood sodium level 
This amphetamine increases the risk of severe and even fatal cases of hyponatremia 
Risk factors The following factors may increase your risk of hyponatremia 
In addition, the recreational drug Ecstasy has been linked to fatal cases of hyponatremia 
Premenopausal women appear to be at the greatest risk of hyponatremia related brain damage 
Always talk with your doctor about the risks of a new medication 
Thirst is generally a good guide to how much water or other fluids you need 
Drinking water is vital for your health, so make sure you drink enough fluids 
Supplements to bring calcium and phosphorus levels into a normal range treat the condition 
Depending on the cause of hypoparathyroidism, you ll likely need to take supplements for life 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are usually related to low calcium levels in the blood 
Muscle aches or cramps in the legs, feet, stomach or face 
Contact your health care provider immediately if you have a seizure or have difficulty breathing 
Causes Hypoparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid glands don t produce enough parathyroid hormone 
There are four small parathyroid glands in the neck behind the thyroid gland 
This mineral is stored in bones and teeth and makes them hard 
This mineral is found in all cells, but mostly in the bones 
Phosphorus is needed to help the body create energy from food 
Phosphorus also helps the muscles, nerves, heart and kidneys function 
It develops after accidental damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands during surgery 
In some cases, the immune system attacks parathyroid tissues as if they were foreign bodies 
In the process, the parathyroid glands stop producing their hormone 
Some types of hereditary hypoparathyroidism are associated with deficiencies of other hormone producing glands 
Low magnesium levels can affect the function of the parathyroid glands 
Normal magnesium levels are required for normal production of parathyroid hormone 
In rare cases, radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism may lead to hypoparathyroidism 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of developing hypoparathyroidism include 
Complications Hypoparathyroidism can result in both reversible and irreversible complications 
Reversible complications Complications due to low calcium levels that may improve with treatment include 
Cramplike spasms of the hands and fingers that can be prolonged and painful 
Muscle pain and twitches or spasms of the muscles of the face, throat or arms 
Problems with kidney function, such as kidney stones and kidney failure 
Abnormal heart rhythms heart arrhythmias and fainting, even heart failure 
Irreversible complicationsAccurate diagnosis and treatment might prevent these complications or keep them from getting worse 
But once they occur, taking calcium and vitamin D usually doesn t reverse the damage 
Hardening and changes in the shape of bones, and poor growth 
Calcium deposits in the brain, which can cause balance problems, movement disorders and seizures 
Parathyroid autotransplantation may be an option to reduce the chances of postoperative hypoparathyroidism 
The surgeon works to preserve parathyroid tissue in the neck during the procedure 
The pituitary gland is a kidney bean sized gland at the base of your brain 
Hypopituitarism is when there isn t enough of one or more of the pituitary hormones 
These include growth, blood pressure and the ability to have children, among others 
People who have hypopituitarism usually need to take medicines for the rest of their lives 
These medicines replace the missing hormones, which helps control symptoms 
SymptomsThe symptoms of hypopituitarism usually start slowly and get worse over time 
They might not be noticed for months or even years 
A second hormone deficiency might increase the symptoms of the first one 
Growth hormone GH deficiencyIn children, GH deficiency can cause growth problems and short stature 
The lack of hormones keeps the ovaries from making enough eggs and estrogen 
It keeps the testicles from making enough sperm and testosterone 
Not being able to get or keep an erection, known as erectile dysfunction 
Too little TSH leads to low levels of thyroid hormones 
Adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH deficiencyThis hormone helps the adrenal glands work correctly 
An ADH deficiency can lead to a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause 
Imbalances in minerals such as sodium and potassium, known as electrolytes 
Prolactin deficiencyProlactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk 
Low levels of prolactin can cause problems with making milk for breastfeeding 
These could be symptoms of sudden damage to the pituitary gland tissue 
Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency and needs medical attention quickly 
One common cause is a tumor of the pituitary gland 
As a pituitary tumor grows, it can press on and damage pituitary tissue 
A tumor also can press on the optic nerves, causing vision problems 
Other potential causes of damage to the pituitary gland that may lead to hypopituitarism include 
Certain medicines, such as narcotics, high dose steroids or certain cancer medicines called checkpoint inhibitors 
Significant blood loss during childbirth, which can damage the front part of the pituitary gland 
This condition is known as Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary necrosis 
In some cases, a change in a gene causes hypopituitarism 
That change is heredity, which means it is passed down in families 
The hypothalamus makes hormones that affect how the pituitary gland works 
But the following may raise the risk of developing hypopituitarism 
Diseases that affect more than one part of the body 
Overview Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare heart defect present at birth congenital 
In this condition, the left side of the heart is extremely underdeveloped 
Advances in care have improved the outlook for babies born with this condition 
SymptomsBabies born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome usually are seriously ill soon after birth 
Cool, clammy skin that can be pale or lips that can be bluish gray 
Breathing that may be slow and shallow or very rapid 
Causes Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs in the womb when a baby s heart is developing 
The heart has four chambers, two on the right and two on the left 
In the lungs, oxygen enriches the blood, which then moves to the heart s left side 
That s because the lower left chamber left ventricle is too small or isn t there 
There are no other clear risk factors for hypoplastic left heart syndrome 
Complications With proper treatment, many babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome survive 
Fluid buildup in the lungs, abdomen, legs and feet edema 
Developing blood clots that may lead to a pulmonary embolism or stroke 
Hypospadias is common and doesn t cause difficulty in caring for your infant 
Surgery usually restores the normal appearance of your child s penis 
With successful treatment of hypospadias, most males can have normal urination and reproduction 
In most cases, the opening of the urethra is within the head of the penis 
Less often, the opening is at the middle or the base of the penis 
Opening of the urethra at a location other than the tip of the penis 
Most infants with hypospadias are diagnosed soon after birth while still in the hospital 
However, slight displacement of the urethral opening may be subtle and more difficult to identify 
In most cases, the exact cause of hypospadias is unknown 
Sometimes, hypospadias is genetic, but environment also may play a role 
This condition is more common in infants with a family history of hypospadias 
Complications If hypospadias is not treated, it can result in 
What s considered low blood pressure for one person might be OK for someone else 
Low blood pressure might cause no noticeable symptoms, or it might cause dizziness and fainting 
The causes of low blood pressure range from dehydration to serious medical conditions 
Causes include dehydration, long term bed rest, pregnancy, certain medical conditions and some medications 
This type of low blood pressure is common in older adults 
This drop in blood pressure occurs to hours after eating 
Eating small, low carbohydrate meals, drinking more water, and avoiding alcohol might help reduce symptoms 
This is a blood pressure drop that happens after standing for long periods 
This type of low blood pressure mostly affects young adults and children 
It might result from miscommunication between the heart and the brain 
It s associated with having very high blood pressure while lying down 
A change of just mm Hg a drop from mm 
Hg systolic, for example can cause dizziness and fainting 
Extreme low blood pressure can lead to a condition known as shock 
It s important to see a health care provider to get a correct diagnosis 
A blood pressure measurement is given in millimeters of mercury mm Hg 
The first upper number is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats 
The American Heart Association categorizes ideal blood pressure as normal 
An ideal blood pressure is usually lower than mm 
Blood pressure is usually lowest at night and rises sharply on waking 
Certain health conditions and use of medications may cause low blood pressure 
Conditions that can cause low blood pressureMedical conditions that can cause low blood pressure include 
Low blood pressure is common in the first weeks of pregnancy 
Blood pressure usually returns to pre pregnancy levels after giving birth 
Low blood sugar hypoglycemia and, sometimes, diabetes also may lower blood pressure 
Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can lead to dehydration 
Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction include a sudden and dramatic drop in blood pressure 
Medications that can cause low blood pressureSome medications can cause low blood pressure, including 
Water pills diuretics , such as furosemide Lasix and hydrochlorothiazide Microzide 
Beta blockers, such as atenolol Tenormin and propranolol Inderal, Innopran XL, Hemangeol 
Drugs for Parkinson s disease, such as pramipexole Mirapex or those containing levodopa 
Certain types of antidepressants tricyclic antidepressants , including doxepin Silenor and imipramine Tofranil 
Risk factors Anyone can have low blood pressure hypotension 
Certain medications, including some blood pressure drugs, increase the risk of low blood pressure 
Parkinson s disease, diabetes and some heart conditions may increase risk of low blood pressure 
Overview Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn t make enough thyroid hormone 
Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages 
SymptomsThe symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition 
Or you may think they are just part of getting older 
But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more obvious problems 
But if hypothyroidism isn t diagnosed and treated, symptoms start to appear 
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, a condition called jaundice 
A soft swelling or bulge near the belly button, a condition called umbilical hernia 
The thyroid gland makes two main hormones thyroxine T and triiodothyronine T 
Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn t make enough hormones 
The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto s disease 
Autoimmune diseases happen when the immune system makes antibodies that attack healthy tissues 
Sometimes that process involves the thyroid gland and affects its ability to make hormones 
Or it can result from an autoimmune disorder or another medical condition affecting the thyroid 
Thyroiditis can trigger the thyroid to release all of its stored thyroid hormone at once 
That causes a spike in thyroid activity, a condition called hyperthyroidism 
One such medicine is lithium, which is used to treat some psychiatric disorders 
Some babies are born with a thyroid gland that doesn t work correctly 
In most cases, the reason the thyroid gland didn t develop properly is not clear 
But some children have an inherited form of a thyroid disorder 
Often, infants born with hypothyroidism don t have noticeable symptoms at first 
That s one reason why most states require newborn thyroid screening 
This is usually because of a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland 
Preeclampsia causes a significant rise in blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy 
The thyroid gland needs the mineral iodine to make thyroid hormones 
Iodine is found mainly in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine rich soil and iodized salt 
Too much iodine can make hypothyroidism worse in people who already have the condition 
Risk factors Although anyone can develop hypothyroidism, you re at an increased risk if you 
Have an autoimmune disease, such as type diabetes or celiac disease 
Complications Hypothyroidism that isn t treated can lead to other health problems, including 
A large goiter may cause problems with swallowing or breathing 
Hypothyroidism can lead to a higher risk of heart disease and heart failure 
Hypothyroidism that goes without treatment for a long time can damage the peripheral nerves 
Peripheral neuropathy may cause pain, numbness and tingling in the arms and legs 
Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which can limit fertility 
Some of the causes of hypothyroidism, such as autoimmune disorders, also can harm fertility 
This rare, life threatening condition can happen when hypothyroidism goes without treatment for a long time 
A myxedema coma may be triggered by sedatives, infection or other stress on the body 
However, it can also affect the large intestine and uncommonly, the upper gastrointestinal tract 
For others, it s a debilitating condition that can lead to life threatening complications 
SymptomsInflammatory bowel disease symptoms vary, depending on the severity of inflammation and where it occurs 
You are likely to have periods of active illness followed by periods of remission 
Signs and symptoms that are common to both Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis include 
Causes The exact cause of inflammatory bowel disease remains unknown 
However, most people with IBD don t have this family history 
Most people who develop IBD are diagnosed before they re years old 
But some people don t develop the disease until their s or s 
Although IBD is more common in white people, it can occur in any race 
Ask your doctor when and how frequently you need to have this test done 
Certain disorders, including arthritis, skin lesions and eye inflammation uveitis , may occur during IBD flare ups 
Certain medications for IBD are associated with a risk of infections 
Corticosteroids can be associated with a risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure and other conditions 
IBD increases the risk of blood clots in veins and arteries 
Crohn s disease affects the full thickness of the intestinal wall 
You may require surgery to remove the diseased portion of your bowel 
But they can also occur internally or toward the wall of the abdominal area 
Symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea or constipation, or both 
IBS is a chronic condition that you ll need to manage long term 
Only a small number of people with IBS have severe symptoms 
Some people can control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and stress 
IBS doesn t cause changes in bowel tissue or increase your risk of colorectal cancer 
SymptomsSymptoms of IBS vary but are usually present for a long time 
Abdominal pain, cramping or bloating that is related to passing a bowel movement 
Changes in how often you are having a bowel movement 
They may indicate a more serious condition, such as colon cancer 
Pain that isn t relieved by passing gas or a bowel movement 
Contractions that are stronger and last longer than usual can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea 
Weak contractions can slow food passage and lead to hard, dry stools 
IBS can develop after a severe bout of diarrhea caused by bacteria or a virus 
IBS might also be associated with a surplus of bacteria in the intestines bacterial overgrowth 
People exposed to stressful events, especially in childhood, tend to have more symptoms of IBS 
The role of food allergy or intolerance in IBS isn t fully understood 
These include wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, milk and carbonated drinks 
Most people with IBS experience worse or more frequent symptoms during periods of increased stress 
But while stress may make symptoms worse, it doesn t cause them 
Risk factors Many people have occasional symptoms of IBS 
But you re more likely to have the syndrome if you 
In the United States, IBS is more common among women 
Estrogen therapy before or after menopause also is a risk factor for IBS 
A history of sexual, physical or emotional abuse also might be a risk factor 
Many people with moderate to severe IBS report poor quality of life 
Experiencing the symptoms of IBS can lead to depression or anxiety 
It also often causes difficulty waking up after you ve been asleep 
The aim of treatment is to control symptoms with medication 
Pseudotumor cerebri idiopathic intracranial hypertension Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
A whooshing sound in your head that pulses with your heartbeat 
Brief episodes of blindness, lasting a few seconds and affecting one or both eyes 
Sometimes, symptoms that have resolved can recur months or years later 
If a cause is determined, the condition is called secondary intracranial hypertension, rather than idiopathic 
Health problemsConditions and diseases that have been linked to secondary intracranial hypertension include 
Complications For some people with pseudotumor cerebri, their vision continues to worsen, leading to blindness 
Overview Immune thrombocytopenia ITP is an illness that can lead to bruising and bleeding 
Once known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, ITP can cause purple bruises 
It also can cause tiny reddish purple dots on the skin that look like a rash 
Bleeding into the skin that looks like tiny reddish purple spots, also known as petechiae 
Bleeding into the skin that s larger than petechiae, also known as purpura 
Causes Immune thrombocytopenia usually happens when the immune system makes a mistake 
It attacks and destroys the cells that help blood clot, also known as platelets 
Risk factors ITP is more common among young women 
A health care provider might suggest treatment to keep the platelet count even 
However, the baby s platelet count should be tested soon after birth 
Toe walking in children Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Kids who continue toe walking beyond the toddler years often do so out of habit 
SymptomsToe walking is walking on the toes or the ball of the foot 
Causes Typically, toe walking is a habit that develops when a child learns to walk 
In a few cases, toe walking is caused by an underlying condition, such as 
This tendon links the lower leg muscles to the back of the heel bone 
If it s too short, it can prevent the heel from touching the ground 
Complications Persistent toe walking can increase a child s risk of falling 
Impacted wisdom teeth can cause pain, damage other teeth and lead to other dental problems 
Impacted wisdom teeth that cause pain or other dental problems usually are taken out 
Wisdom teeth usually emerge sometime between the ages of and 
But in many cases, the mouth is too crowded for proper development of third molars 
An impacted wisdom tooth may partially emerge so that some of the crown is visible 
If the tooth never breaks through the gums, it s called a fully impacted wisdom tooth 
Grow at an angle toward the next tooth, which is the second molar 
Grow at an angle toward the back of the mouth 
Grow straight up or down like other teeth but stay trapped within the jawbone 
Complications Impacted wisdom teeth can cause several problems in the mouth, including 
This type of tumor is usually noncancerous, also called benign 
But tissue and bone may need to be taken out due to this problem 
Regularly updated dental X rays may show impacted wisdom teeth before any symptoms start 
Overview Prediabetes means you have a higher than normal blood sugar level 
It s not high enough to be considered type diabetes yet 
One possible sign of prediabetes is darkened skin on certain parts of the body 
Classic signs and symptoms that suggest you ve moved from prediabetes to type diabetes include 
What is clear is that people with prediabetes don t process sugar glucose properly anymore 
Most of the glucose in your body comes from the food you eat 
Your pancreas sends insulin to your blood when you eat 
When you have prediabetes, this process doesn t work as well 
As a result, instead of fueling your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream 
Your cells become resistant to insulin and don t allow as much sugar in 
The less active you are, the greater your risk of prediabetes 
Although diabetes can develop at any age, the risk of prediabetes increases after age 
People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea 
Other conditions associated with an increased risk of prediabetes include 
Low levels of high density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol, the good cholesterol 
High levels of triglycerides a type of fat in your blood 
A combination of three or more of these conditions is often called metabolic syndrome 
Prediabetes can progress to type diabetes, which can lead to 
Over about a week, the sores burst and develop honey colored crusts 
Treatment with antibiotics can limit the spread of impetigo to others 
SymptomsThe main symptom of impetigo is reddish sores, often around the nose and mouth 
The sores quickly rupture, ooze for a few days and then form a honey colored crust 
Sores can spread to other areas of the body through touch, clothing and towels 
Ecthyma is a serious form of impetigo that causes painful fluid or pus filled sores 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of impetigo include 
Impetigo occurs most commonly in children ages to 
And the sores in mild forms of the infection generally heal without scarring 
One of the types of bacteria that cause impetigo can also damage the kidneys 
PreventionKeeping skin clean is the best way to keep it healthy 
It s important to wash cuts, scrapes, insect bites and other wounds right away 
Wear gloves when applying antibiotic ointment and wash your hands thoroughly afterward 
Cut an infected child s nails short to prevent damage from scratching 
Encourage regular and thorough handwashing and good hygiene in general 
Keep your child with impetigo home until your doctor says they aren t contagious 
Different gene changes cause different types of inherited metabolic disorders 
These gene changes are most commonly passed down from both parents 
But sometimes the gene change comes only from one parent, most often from the mother 
Metabolism is the complex set of chemical reactions that your body uses to maintain life 
Other chemical processes break down substances that your body no longer needs 
When these processes don t work properly, a metabolic disorder occurs 
SymptomsThere are hundreds of inherited metabolic disorders caused by different genes 
Symptoms depend on the type of disorder and how severe it is 
Causes Inherited metabolic disorders are caused by changes in specific genes that affect metabolism 
There are hundreds of inherited metabolic disorders caused by different genes 
In some cases, future parents may decide to have carrier testing before pregnancy 
The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens to the vagina 
As pregnancy goes on and you get ready to give birth, the cervix slowly changes 
An incompetent cervix can be a hard problem to diagnose and treat 
SymptomsWith an incompetent cervix, there may be no signs or symptoms during early pregnancy 
Some women have mild discomfort or spotting before the diagnosis 
Risk factors Many women don t have a known risk factor 
A previous procedure or surgery on the cervix could lead to an incompetent cervix 
This includes surgery to treat a cervical problem found during a Pap test 
Complications An incompetent cervix may be risky for your pregnancy 
But there s a lot you can do to have a healthy, full term pregnancy 
During pregnancy, you ll need more folic acid, calcium, iron and other essential nutrients 
Taking a daily prenatal vitamin can help if you re not eating enough healthy foods 
Prenatal vitamins can be started a few months before conception and continued throughout your pregnancy 
Gaining the right amount of weight can support your baby s health 
Infant jaundice Overview Infant jaundice is yellow discoloration of a newborn baby s skin and eyes 
In some babies, an underlying disease may cause infant jaundice 
Most infants born between weeks gestation and full term need no treatment for jaundice 
To check for infant jaundice, press gently on your baby s forehead or nose 
If the skin looks yellow where you pressed, it s likely your baby has mild jaundice 
Examine your baby in good lighting conditions, preferably in natural daylight 
The following signs or symptoms may indicate severe jaundice or complications from excess bilirubin 
The skin on your baby s the abdomen, arms or legs looks yellow 
Your baby seems listless or sick or is difficult to awaken 
Your baby develops any other signs or symptoms that concern you 
Causes Excess bilirubin hyperbilirubinemia is the main cause of jaundice 
Normally, the liver filters bilirubin from the bloodstream and releases it into the intestinal tract 
A newborn s immature liver often can t remove bilirubin quickly enough, causing an excess of bilirubin 
An incompatibility between the mother s blood and the baby s blood 
Biliary atresia, a condition in which the baby s bile ducts are blocked or scarred 
An abnormality of your baby s red blood cells that causes them to break down rapidly 
Dehydration or a low caloric intake may contribute to the onset of jaundice 
However, because of the benefits of breast feeding, experts still recommend it 
It s important to make sure your baby gets enough to eat and is adequately hydrated 
Studies show that babies of East Asian ancestry have an increased risk of developing jaundice 
Acute bilirubin encephalopathyBilirubin is toxic to cells of the brain 
Signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy in a baby with jaundice include 
Some infectious diseases can be passed from person to person 
Many infectious diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, can be prevented by vaccines 
Frequent and thorough hand washing also helps protect you from most infectious diseases 
SymptomsEach infectious disease has its own specific signs and symptoms 
General signs and symptoms common to a number of infectious diseases include 
Many skin diseases, such as ringworm and athlete s foot, are caused by fungi 
Other types of fungi can infect your lungs or nervous system 
Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite that is transmitted by a mosquito bite 
Other parasites may be transmitted to humans from animal feces 
Infectious diseases can be spread through direct contact such as 
These germs can also spread through the exchange of body fluids from sexual contact 
For example, you can get a toxoplasmosis infection by scooping your cat s litter box 
A pregnant woman may pass germs that cause infectious diseases to her unborn baby 
Some germs can pass through the placenta or through breast milk 
Germs in the vagina can also be transmitted to the baby during birth 
Indirect contactDisease causing organisms also can be passed by indirect contact 
Mosquitoes can carry the malaria parasite or West Nile virus 
Deer ticks may carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease 
Food contaminationDisease causing germs can also infect you through contaminated food and water 
You have certain types of cancer or other disorders that affect your immune system 
But some infections such as pneumonia, AIDS and meningitis can become life threatening 
A few types of infections have been linked to a long term increased risk of cancer 
Helicobacter pylori is linked to stomach cancer and peptic ulcers 
Hepatitis B and C have been linked to liver cancer 
For example, someone who s had chickenpox may develop shingles much later in life 
Vaccination can drastically reduce your chances of contracting many diseases 
Don t go to work if you are vomiting, have diarrhea or have a fever 
Don t send your child to school if he or she has these signs, either 
Keep counters and other kitchen surfaces clean when preparing meals 
Cook foods to the proper temperature, using a food thermometer to check for doneness 
Overview If you and your partner are struggling to have a baby, you re not alone 
Millions of people around the world face the same challenge 
But many safe and effective treatments can boost your chances of getting pregnant 
Some women with infertility may have irregular menstrual periods or no periods 
Many couples eventually will conceive with or without treatment 
But women should talk with a healthcare professional sooner if they 
Are age or older and have tried to conceive for six months or longer 
Men should talk to a healthcare professional if they have 
A low number of sperm or other problems with sperm 
Ovulation is the release of an egg from an ovary 
Sometimes, the issues that cause infertility in couples are present at birth 
Conditions that can affect how much sperm is made or sperm quality 
Infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, mumps or HIV also can impact sperm 
Enlarged veins in the scrotum, called a varicocele, can affect sperm s quality 
Exposure to pesticides, other chemicals or radiation can affect fertility 
So can medicines that treat bacterial infections, high blood pressure and depression 
Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation can affect sperm production 
These conditions affect the release of eggs from the ovaries 
Other underlying causes may include too much exercise, eating disorders or tumors 
Fibroids can block the fallopian tubes, where an egg and sperm unite 
Often, these issues are caused by swelling of the fallopian tube, called salpingitis 
It may affect the how well the ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes work 
Certain cancers especially ones that affect the reproductive organs often reduce female fertility 
Women s fertility slowly declines with age, especially in the mid s 
Men over age may be less fertile than younger men 
Smoking tobacco by either partner may lower the chances of pregnancy 
The risk of miscarriages may rise in women who smoke tobacco 
Use during pregnancy has been linked with negative health effects on unborn babies 
It also might raise the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth 
For men, heavy drinking can lower sperm count and affect how well sperm move 
An inactive lifestyle and being overweight or obese can raise the risk of infertility 
Obesity is linked with lower quality of semen, the fluid that contains sperm 
Those who follow a very low calorie or restrictive diet also are at risk 
A lack of exercise plays a role in obesity, which raises the risk of infertility 
But the following tips may boost your chances of pregnancy 
MenMost types of infertility aren t preventable in men, but these tips may help 
Stay away from drugs and tobacco, and don t drink a lot of alcohol 
Doing illegal drugs, smoking or drinking heavily can raise the risk of male infertility 
The high temperatures can have a short term effect on sperm production and movement 
Being exposed to them can affect the body s ability to make sperm 
Talk with your health care team about any medicines you take regularly 
Regular exercise may improve sperm quality and boost the chances of a pregnancy 
WomenFor women, the following tips may boost the chances of getting pregnant 
It s also terrible for your health and the health of an unborn baby 
If you smoke and you want to try to become pregnant, quit tobacco now 
These substances could make you less likely to conceive and have a healthy pregnancy 
Some women may need to cut back on caffeine when they try to get pregnant 
That s about the amount in a ounce cup of brewed coffee 
The effects of caffeine aren t clear for an unborn baby 
But the effects of higher amounts may include miscarriage or preterm birth 
Being overweight or underweight can affect your hormones and cause infertility 
In up to half of these couples, male infertility plays at least a partial role 
Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices and other factors may contribute to male infertility 
SymptomsThe main sign of male infertility is the inability to conceive a child 
Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosomal or hormonal abnormality 
Erection or ejaculation problems, low sex drive, or other problems with sexual function 
Pain, discomfort, a lump or swelling in the testicle area 
Initially, this involves the growth and formation of the male reproductive organs during puberty 
A varicocele is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle 
In some cases, surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors can affect male fertility 
Decreased fertility is more likely in men who have had this condition 
Low testosterone male hypogonadism and other hormonal problems have a number of possible underlying causes 
Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis and Kallmann s syndrome 
Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also may cause infertility 
Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production, though it will often eventually return to normal 
With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced 
Health, lifestyle and other causesSome other causes of male infertility include 
Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels, cause erectile dysfunction and decrease sperm production 
Liver disease caused by excessive drinking also may lead to fertility problems 
Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don t smoke 
Risk factors Risk factors linked to male infertility include 
Having a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery 
Being born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative with a fertility disorder 
Having certain medical conditions, including tumors and chronic illnesses, such as sickle cell disease 
Stress and relationship difficulties related to the inability to have a child 
Increased risk of testicular cancer, melanoma, colon cancer and prostate cancer 
However, you can try to avoid some known causes of male infertility 
Avoid things that lead to prolonged heat for the testicles 
The pancreas is a long, flat gland that s tucked behind the stomach 
The pancreas helps the body digest food and regulates blood sugars 
This means it appears suddenly and generally lasts a short time 
The damage to the pancreas can get worse over time 
More serious disease requires treatment in a hospital and can cause life threatening complications 
Pain in the upper belly that radiates to the back 
Some people with chronic pancreatitis only develop symptoms after they get complications of the disease 
It produces insulin, which helps the body manage and use sugars 
The pancreas also produces dietary juices, called enzymes, that help with digestion 
The pancreas makes and stores turned off versions of the enzymes 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of pancreatitis include 
Research shows that having four or five drinks a day increases the risk of pancreatitis 
Compared with nonsmokers, smokers are on average three times more likely to develop chronic pancreatitis 
A number of genes have been linked to chronic pancreatitis 
Acute pancreatitis may result in the kidneys not filtering waste from the blood 
Artificial filtering, called dialysis, may be needed for short term or long term treatment 
A large pseudocyst that ruptures can cause complications such as internal bleeding and infection 
Diabetes can develop when chronic pancreatitis damages cells that produce insulin 
Long standing inflammation in the pancreas is a risk factor for cancer of the pancreas 
Overview Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding the heart pericardium 
The chest pain occurs when the irritated layers of the pericardium rub against each other 
Treatment for more severe cases may include medications and, rarely, surgery 
Early diagnosis and treatment may help reduce the risk of long term complications from pericarditis 
However, some people have dull, achy or pressure like chest pain 
Pericarditis pain usually occurs behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest 
Get worse when coughing, lying down or taking a deep breath 
Acute pericarditis begins suddenly but doesn t last longer than three weeks 
Incessant pericarditis lasts about four to six weeks but less than three months 
Chronic constrictive pericarditis usually develops slowly and lasts longer than three months 
Causes The cause of pericarditis is often hard to determine 
Complications Early diagnosis and treatment of pericarditis usually reduces the risk of complications 
Some people with long term pericarditis develop permanent thickening and scarring of the pericardium 
The changes prevent the heart from filling and emptying properly 
Pressure on the heart due to fluid buildup cardiac tamponade 
Less blood leaves the heart, causing a dramatic drop in blood pressure 
However, taking these steps to prevent infections might help reduce the risk of heart inflammation 
Avoid people who have a viral or flu like illness until they ve recovered 
If you re sick with symptoms of a viral infection, try to avoid exposing others 
Talk to your health care provider about the benefits and risks of vaccines 
An ingrown hair can cause tiny, swollen bumps on the skin that may hurt 
The condition most often affects Black people with curly hair who shave 
Small bumps that look like blisters or are filled with pus 
When to see a doctorAn occasional ingrown hair isn t cause for alarm 
Seek medical care if your condition doesn t clear up or if it causes problems regularly 
Hair structure and direction of growth play a role in ingrown hair 
Shaving creates a sharp edge on hair, making it easier to pierce the skin 
This action causes hair to draw back into the skin 
Risk factors The main risk factor for ingrown hair is having tightly curled hair 
Complications Ingrown hair that doesn t clear up can lead to 
Patches of skin that are darker than usual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation 
PreventionTo help prevent ingrown hair, avoid shaving, tweezing and waxing 
If that s not an option, use these tips to make ingrown hair less likely 
Before shaving wash your skin with warm water and a mild facial cleanser 
Apply lubricating shaving cream or gel a few minutes before shaving to soften the hair 
Rinse your skin and apply a cool, wet cloth for about five minutes 
The following hair removal methods also may help prevent ingrown hair 
Hold the razor or clippers slightly away from your skin 
The result is pain, inflamed skin, swelling and, sometimes, an infection 
Often you can take care of ingrown toenails on your own 
When to see a doctorSee your health care provider if you 
Experience severe discomfort in a toe, pus or inflamed skin that seems to be spreading 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of ingrown toenails include 
Being an adolescent, when feet tend to perspire more, which softens the nail and skin 
Having a condition, such as diabetes, that causes poor blood flow 
Don t curve your nails to match the shape of the front of your toe 
Insomnia can drain your energy level and affect your mood 
It also can affect your health, work performance and quality of life 
How much sleep is enough varies from person to person 
But most adults need to hours a night 
Short term insomnia is usually due to stress or a distressing event 
But some people have long term insomnia, also called chronic insomnia 
You do not have to put up with sleepless nights 
Having a hard time paying attention, focusing on tasks or remembering 
Your doctor will search for the cause of your sleep problem and help treat it 
Causes Insomnia may be the main problem or it may be related to other conditions 
Long term insomnia is usually due to stress, life events or habits that disrupt sleep 
Other poor sleep habits include working, eating or watching TV while in bed 
But eating too much may cause you to feel uncomfortable while lying down 
Anxiety disorders, such as post traumatic stress disorder, may disrupt your sleep 
Waking up too early can be a sign of depression 
Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing at times during the night, disrupting your sleep 
This may keep you from falling asleep or getting back to sleep 
Coffee, tea, cola and other drinks that have caffeine are stimulants 
Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can disrupt sleep 
But older people typically still need the same amount of sleep as younger people 
A lack of activity can disrupt a good night s sleep 
Sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome become more common with age 
Older people typically use more prescription drugs than younger people do 
Insomnia in children and teensSleep problems may be a concern for children and teenagers too 
They want to go to bed later and sleep later in the morning 
Risk factors Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night 
Changes in hormones during the menstrual cycle and in menopause may play a role 
During menopause, night sweats and hot flashes often disrupt sleep 
Many issues that affect your mental or physical health can disrupt sleep 
For example, changing shifts at work or traveling can disrupt your sleep wake cycle 
Whatever is keeping you from sleeping, insomnia can affect you mentally and physically 
People with insomnia report a lower quality of life compared with people who sleep well 
Slowed reaction time while driving and a higher risk of accidents 
Mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety or substance misuse 
Make your bedroom comfortable for sleep and only use it for sex or sleep 
Having just one of these conditions doesn t mean you have metabolic syndrome 
But it does mean you have a greater risk of serious disease 
Metabolic syndrome is increasingly common, and up to one third of U S adults have it 
SymptomsMost of the disorders associated with metabolic syndrome don t have obvious signs or symptoms 
One sign that is visible is a large waist circumference 
Causes Metabolic syndrome is closely linked to overweight or obesity and inactivity 
Normally, your digestive system breaks down the foods you eat into sugar 
Risk factors The following factors increase your chances of having metabolic syndrome 
Carrying too much weight, especially in your abdomen, increases your risk of metabolic syndrome 
Complications Having metabolic syndrome can increase your risk of developing 
PreventionA lifelong commitment to a healthy lifestyle may prevent the conditions that cause metabolic syndrome 
Getting at least minutes of physical activity most days 
Eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, lean protein and whole grains 
These explosive outbursts, which occur off and on, cause major distress 
They can harm relationships and cause problems at work or school 
Intermittent explosive disorder is a long term condition that can go on for years 
Treatment involves talk therapy and medicine to help you control your aggressive impulses 
SymptomsImpulsive attacks and angry outbursts occur suddenly, with little or no warning 
These bouts may occur often or be separated by weeks or months 
Verbal outbursts or less severe physical attacks may still occur in between these times 
You may be irritable, impulsive, aggressive or angry most of the time 
You may feel a sense of relief and tiredness after the outburst 
Later, you may feel guilty, sorry for your actions or embarrassed 
You also can ask for a referral to a mental health professional 
It s more common in younger adults than in older adults 
There could be a gene related to the tendency to react more easily to stress 
This gene may be passed down from parents to children 
Risk factors These factors raise your risk of developing intermittent explosive disorder 
So can having other disorders that include disruptive behaviors, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD 
Problems with alcohol and drugs also can be a risk factor 
Complications People with intermittent explosive disorder have a higher risk of 
Others often think that people with intermittent impulsive disorder are always angry 
These actions can lead to relationship problems, divorce and family stress 
Mood disorders such as depression and anxiety often occur with intermittent explosive disorder 
Problems with alcohol or drugs often occur along with intermittent explosive disorder 
After you start treatment, follow the plan and practice the skills you learn 
Intestinal ischemia can affect your small intestine, your large intestine colon or both 
The decreased blood flow doesn t provide enough oxygen for the cells in your digestive system 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of intestinal ischemia can develop suddenly acute or gradually chronic 
Symptoms of sudden acute intestinal ischemiaSigns and symptoms of acute intestinal ischemia typically include 
Sudden belly abdominal pain that may be mild, moderate or severe 
Symptoms of gradually developing chronic intestinal ischemiaSigns and symptoms of chronic intestinal ischemia can include 
Abdominal pain that gets gradually worse over weeks or months 
Fear of eating because of pain that happens after eating 
When to see a doctorSeek immediate medical care if you have sudden, severe abdominal pain 
Narrowing of an artery due to buildup of fatty deposits, such as cholesterol atherosclerosis 
Low blood pressure leading to an overall reduced blood flow 
Dangerously low blood pressure hypotension related to dehydration, heart failure, major surgery, trauma or shock 
A blood clot or severe atherosclerosis in an artery supplying the colon 
Twisting of the bowel volvulus or trapping of intestinal contents within a hernia 
Excessive bowel enlargement from bowel blockage caused by scar tissue or a tumor 
It usually blocks the superior mesenteric artery, which supplies oxygen rich blood to your intestines 
This is the most common cause of acute mesenteric artery ischemia 
This type of sudden ischemia tends to occur in people with chronic intestinal ischemia 
This can cause blood flow to be suddenly blocked, resulting in acute mesenteric ischemia 
Ischemia due to mesenteric venous thrombosisThis ischemia occurs when blood can t leave your small intestines 
A blood clot can develop in a vein draining blood from your intestines 
Veins carry blood that has had the oxygen removed back to the heart 
When the vein is blocked, blood backs up in the intestines, causing swelling and bleeding 
Acute or chronic irritation and swelling inflammation of your pancreas pancreatitis 
Bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn s disease or diverticulitis 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of intestinal ischemia include 
People older than are more likely to develop intestinal ischemia 
Cigarettes and other forms of smoked tobacco increase your risk of intestinal ischemia 
Examples include sickle cell anemia and the Factor V Leiden mutation 
Cocaine and methamphetamine use have been linked to intestinal ischemia 
Emphysema, a type of COPD, and other smoking related lung diseases increase this risk 
Whipple disease can also infect other organs, including your brain, heart and eyes 
Without proper treatment, Whipple disease can be serious or fatal 
SymptomsCommon signs and symptomsDigestive signs and symptoms are common in Whipple disease and may include 
Other frequent signs and symptoms associated with Whipple disease include 
Less common signs and symptomsIn some cases, signs and symptoms of Whipple disease may include 
Skin darkening in areas exposed to the sun and in scars 
Brain and nervous system neurological signs and symptoms may include 
Symptoms tend to develop slowly over many years in most people with this disease 
When to see a doctorWhipple disease is potentially life threatening yet usually treatable 
Your doctor can perform tests to determine the cause of your symptoms 
The disease can recur, so it s important to watch for symptoms that reappear 
Causes Whipple disease is caused by a type of bacterium called Tropheryma whipplei 
The bacteria also damage the fine, hairlike projections villi that line the small intestine 
Whipple disease is extremely uncommon, affecting fewer than in million people 
Based on available reports, it appears more likely to affect 
Farmers and other people who work outdoors and have frequent contact with sewage and wastewater 
Although the infection is rare, associated deaths continue to be reported 
This is due in large part to late diagnoses and delayed treatment 
Overview Intracranial venous malformations are veins in the brain that are unusually large 
These larger veins aren t likely to cause symptoms or affect how the veins work 
Sometimes, they re found by accident when you have a brain imaging test for another condition 
This telescoping action often blocks food or fluid from passing through 
Intussusception also cuts off the blood supply to the part of the intestine that s affected 
The cause of most cases of intussusception in children is unknown 
In children, the intestines can usually be pushed back into position with a minor procedure 
In adults, surgery is often required to correct the problem 
Infants who have belly pain may pull their knees to their chests when they cry 
The pain of intussusception comes and goes, usually every to minutes at first 
These painful episodes last longer and happen more often as time passes 
Some children don t pass blood or have a lump in the belly 
And some older children have pain but no other symptoms 
The most common symptom is belly pain that comes and goes 
People sometimes have symptoms for weeks before seeking medical attention 
If you or your child develops the symptoms listed above, seek medical help right away 
In most cases, however, no cause can be found for intussusception 
ChildrenIn most cases of intussusception in children, the cause is unknown 
Intussusception seems to occur more often in the fall and winter 
Weight loss surgery such as gastric bypass or other surgery on the intestinal tract 
Swelling in the intestines due to diseases such as Crohn s disease 
Risk factors Risk factors for intussusception include 
Intestinal malrotation is a condition in which the intestine doesn t develop or rotate correctly 
Complications Intussusception can cut off the blood supply to the affected portion of the intestine 
If left untreated, lack of blood causes tissue of the intestinal wall to die 
Tissue death can lead to a tear in the intestinal wall, called a perforation 
This can cause an infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity, known as peritonitis 
Peritonitis is a life threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention 
Breathing that may be either slow and shallow or very rapid 
A child who is in shock may be conscious or unconscious 
If you suspect your child is in shock, seek emergency medical care right away 
Invasive lobular carcinoma makes up a small portion of all breast cancers 
The most common type of breast cancer begins in the breast ducts invasive ductal carcinoma 
SymptomsAt its earliest stages, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause no signs and symptoms 
A new area of fullness or swelling in the breast 
Routine screening tests may include a physical exam and a mammogram 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of invasive lobular carcinoma include 
Women are more likely to develop breast cancer, but men also can develop breast cancer 
Women with certain inherited genes may have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers 
PreventionTo reduce your risk of breast cancer, consider trying to 
Discuss the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy with your doctor 
If your current weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight 
If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy weight loss strategies 
Aim to lose weight slowly about or pounds a week 
The iris is located in the front portion anterior of the uvea 
Uveitis is inflammation of part of or all of the uvea 
It can result from an underlying condition or genetic factor 
If untreated, iritis could lead to glaucoma or vision loss 
See your doctor as soon as possible if you have symptoms of iritis 
It usually develops suddenly, and can last up to three months 
Iritis that develops suddenly, over hours or days, is known as acute iritis 
Symptoms that develop gradually or last longer than three months indicate chronic iritis 
In some cases, iritis can be linked to eye trauma, genetic factors or certain diseases 
Infectious diseases from other viruses and bacteria can also be linked to uveitis 
Risk factors Your risk of developing iritis increases if you 
Certain infections, such as syphilis or HIV AIDS, are linked with a significant risk of iritis 
This includes conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis 
This causes degeneration of your cornea and could decrease your vision 
The pancreas is a long, flat gland that sits behind the stomach 
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors start from the hormone producing cells in the pancreas 
Another term for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor is islet cell cancer 
Most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors do not produce an excess amount of hormones 
Tumors that don t produce extra hormones are called nonfunctional tumors 
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes 
Causes Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors happen when cells in the pancreas develop changes in their DNA 
Sometimes the cells can break away and spread to other organs, such as the liver 
In pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, the DNA changes happen in hormone producing cells called islet cells 
It s not clear what causes the changes that lead to cancer 
If a family member was diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, your risk is increased 
Syndromes present at birth that increase the risk of tumors 
These inherited syndromes are caused by changes in the DNA 
These changes allow cells to grow and divide more than needed 
If you develop this type of cancer, you didn t do anything to cause it 
Overview Itchy skin is an irritating sensation that makes you want to scratch 
Repeated scratching can cause raised thick areas of skin that might bleed or become infected 
Many people find relief with self care measures such as moisturizers, gentle cleansers and lukewarm baths 
Long term relief requires identifying and treating the cause of itchy skin 
Common treatments are medicated creams, moist dressings and anti itch medicines taken by mouth 
SymptomsItchy skin can affect small areas, such as the scalp, an arm or a leg 
Itchy skin can occur without any other noticeable changes on the skin 
Sometimes itchiness lasts a long time and can be intense 
As you rub or scratch the area, it gets itchier 
Lasts more than two weeks and doesn t improve with self care measures 
Is severe and distracts you from your daily routines or prevents you from sleeping 
Comes with other symptoms, such as weight loss, fever or night sweats 
Examples include multiple sclerosis, pinched nerves and shingles herpes zoster 
Wool, chemicals, soaps and other things can irritate the skin and cause rashes and itching 
Sometimes a substance, such as poison ivy or cosmetics, causes an allergic reaction 
But you may be more likely to develop it if you 
Are an older adult, as skin can become drier with age 
It might disturb your sleep or cause anxiety or depression 
SymptomsA tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue 
A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material 
It develops most often in the jaw near the molars 
The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone 
Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells 
They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw 
The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms 
This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth 
This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws 
Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars 
This is a rare, slow growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw 
Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption 
Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw 
Overview Jellyfish stings are fairly common problems for people swimming, wading or diving in oceans 
Most often jellyfish stings cause instant pain and inflamed marks on the skin 
Most jellyfish stings get better over a few days or weeks with home treatment 
Throbbing pain that radiates up a leg or an arm 
These reactions may appear rapidly or several hours after the stings 
When to see a doctorSeek emergency treatment if you have severe symptoms 
Causes Jellyfish stings are caused by brushing against a jellyfish tentacle 
Each stinger has a tiny bulb that holds venom and a coiled, sharp tipped tube 
When you brush against a tentacle, tiny triggers on its surface release the stingers 
It affects the area of contact and may enter the bloodstream 
Jellyfish that have washed up on a beach may still release venomous stingers if touched 
Types of jellyfishMany types of jellyfish are fairly harmless to humans 
Others can cause severe pain and a full body systemic reaction 
Box jellyfish can cause intense pain and, rarely, life threatening reactions 
Also called bluebottle jellyfish, Portuguese man of war jellyfish live mostly in warmer seas 
This type has a blue or purplish gas filled bubble that keeps it afloat 
They re most common in cooler, northern regions of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans 
Risk factors Conditions that increase the risk of jellyfish stings 
Swimming when jellyfish appear in large numbers a jellyfish bloom 
Playing or sunbathing where jellyfish are washed up on the beach 
Irukandji syndrome, which causes chest and stomach pain, high blood pressure, and heart problems 
Diving stores sell protective skin suits or stinger suits made of thin, high tech fabric 
Consider protective footwear, as stings can also occur while wading in shallow water 
Stay out of the water in jellyfish areas when jellyfish numbers are high 
Your body has its own internal clock, called circadian rhythms 
They signal to your body when to stay awake and when to sleep 
Jet lag occurs because your body s internal clock is synced to your original time zone 
It hasn t changed to the time zone of where you ve traveled 
The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag 
Jet lag can cause daytime fatigue, an unwell feeling, trouble staying alert and stomach problems 
But you can take steps to help prevent or lessen the effects of jet lag 
You may experience only one symptom or you may have many 
Sleep problems such as not being able to fall asleep or waking up early 
Not being able to focus or function at your usual level 
Symptoms are likely to be worse or last longer the farther you travel 
It usually takes about a day to recover for each time zone crossed 
Your internal clock, also called circadian rhythms, regulates your sleep wake cycle 
That means you re ready for bed just as Parisians are waking up 
It takes a few days for your body to adjust 
The effect of sunlightA key influence on circadian rhythms is sunlight 
However, the timing of light needs to be done properly 
If you don t drink enough water during your flight, you can get slightly dehydrated 
Dehydration also may contribute to some symptoms of jet lag 
Risk factors Factors that increase the likelihood you ll experience jet lag include 
The more time zones you cross, the more likely you are to feel jet lag 
Pilots, flight attendants and business travelers are most likely to experience jet lag 
Older adults may need more time to recover from jet lag 
PreventionA few basic steps may help prevent jet lag or reduce its effects 
If possible, eat meals closer to the time you ll be eating them during your trip 
Light exposure is a prime influence on your body s circadian rhythms 
After traveling east, expose yourself to morning light to adapt to an earlier time zone 
The one exception is if you ve traveled across more than eight time zones 
Set your watch or phone to the new time before you leave 
Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as these can dehydrate you and affect your sleep 
Try to sleep on the plane if it s nighttime at your destination 
Earplugs, headphones and eye masks can help block noise and light 
If it s daytime where you re going, resist the urge to sleep 
Jock itch gets its name because it s common in athletes 
It usually clears up in to weeks with antifungal creams and self care 
A rash whose center tends to clear as the rash spreads 
A rash that may be full or partially ring shaped 
A rash that might be red, brown, purple or gray depending on your skin color 
Jock itch is often caused by the same organism that causes athlete s foot 
Risk factors You re at greater risk of jock itch if you 
Dry your feet last to avoid spreading athlete s foot to the groin area 
Choose underwear, athletic supporters and sports uniforms that fit well 
Tight fitting clothes can chafe your skin and up the risk of jock itch 
Don t let others use your clothing, towels or other personal items 
Control athlete s foot to prevent its spread to the groin 
However, even people who don t participate in jumping sports can get patellar tendinitis 
Over time, the pain worsens and starts to interfere with playing your sport 
The stress results in tiny tears in the tendon, which your body attempts to repair 
When this tendon damage persists for more than a few weeks, it s called tendinopathy 
Running and jumping are most commonly associated with patellar tendinitis 
Some illnesses disrupt blood flow to the knee, which weakens the tendon 
PreventionTo reduce your risk of developing patellar tendinitis, take these steps 
As soon as you notice exercise related knee pain, ice the area and rest 
Until your knee is pain free, avoid activities that put stress on your patellar tendon 
Strong thigh muscles are better able to handle the stresses that can cause patellar tendinitis 
The cancer forms growths of cells, called lesions, on the skin 
The lesions often form on the face, arms and legs 
Lesions also can appear on the genitals or in the mouth 
In severe Kaposi sarcoma, lesions can be in the digestive tract and lungs 
In someone with a weakened immune system, however, HHV can lead to Kaposi sarcoma 
This type happens in people infected with human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV 
This type occurs in older men of Eastern European, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent 
It usually grows slowly and can cause swelling in areas such as the legs 
It can grow slowly on the skin or quickly inside the body 
Test to find Kaposi sarcoma in the digestive tract might include 
If it shows hidden blood, other tests might be needed to find the source 
These tests are used to see if Kaposi sarcoma is causing the bleeding 
In this test, a thin tube, called an endoscope, is passed through the mouth 
It allows a health professional to look at the walls of these organs 
Tests to find Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs might include 
A chest X ray might show something unusual in the lungs 
This imaging test uses X rays to make detailed images of the lungs 
This allows for viewing the lining of the lungs and taking samples of lung tissue 
But there are many treatment options that can help control it 
Instead, the condition might be monitored to make sure it s not getting worse 
This might be the only treatment needed for Kaposi sarcoma 
Low dose radiation, which is also helpful for lesions in the mouth 
Applying a vitamin A like medicine called a retinoid to the skin 
Chemotherapy might an option when Kaposi sarcoma affects multiple parts of the body 
For Kaposi sarcoma that s getting worse quickly, chemotherapy might help 
Kawasaki disease most often affects the heart arteries in children 
Kawasaki disease is sometimes called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome 
With early treatment, most children get better and have no long lasting problems 
And the child has at least four of the following symptoms 
A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area 
Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet 
Let your child s healthcare professional know about a symptom that has gone away 
Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of damage to the heart arteries 
They still need treatment within days of when symptoms appear 
But experts don t believe the disease spreads from person to person 
Certain genes might make children more likely to get Kawasaki disease 
Children under years old are at highest risk of Kawasaki disease 
Children who are assigned male at birth are slightly more likely to get Kawasaki disease 
Children of Asian or Pacific Islander descent have higher rates of Kawasaki disease 
Swelling of blood vessels, most often the arteries that send blood to the heart 
These can lead to a heart attack or cause bleeding inside the body 
Rarely, for children who get heart artery problems, Kawasaki disease can cause death 
If you re prone to developing keloids, you might get them in more than one place 
A keloid scar isn t harmful to your physical health, but it can cause emotional distress 
Even with treatment, a keloid can last for years or recur 
SymptomsA keloid scar may form within months to years of the inciting injury 
Thick, irregular scarring, typically on the earlobes, shoulders, cheeks or middle chest 
When to see a doctorEarly treatment can help minimize growth of a keloid 
Talk with a doctor soon after you notice a keloid 
But most agree it s likely a dysfunction of the wound healing process 
Risk factors Risk factors for keloids include 
Keloids are most common in people with brown or Black skin 
Keloids can run in families, indicating that the tendency might be inherited 
If you ve had one keloid, you re at risk of developing others 
Complications Keloids located on a joint might develop hard, tight tissue that restricts movement 
PreventionIf you re prone to developing keloids, take these preventive self care tips 
Apply a thin layer of petrolatum jelly Vaseline, Aquaphor or other ointment 
Applying pressure earrings to your earlobes after an ear piercing helps prevent keloids 
After surgery, ask your doctor about postoperative care and follow the instructions carefully 
Keratitis may or may not be associated with an infection 
Infectious keratitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites 
Delays in diagnosis and treatment of keratitis can lead to serious complications, including blindness 
If any object scratches or injures the surface of your cornea, noninfectious keratitis may result 
Poor contact lens hygiene or contact lens overwear can cause both noninfectious and infectious keratitis 
The herpes viruses herpes simplex and herpes zoster may cause keratitis 
Staphylococcus, streptococcus and pseudomonas are common bacteria involved in keratitis 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of keratitis include 
Choose daily wear contacts and take them out before going to sleep 
Wash, rinse and dry your hands thoroughly before handling your contacts 
Follow your eye care provider s recommendations for taking care of your lenses 
Replace your contact lens case every to months 
Discard the solution in the contact lens case each time you disinfect your lenses 
Don t top off the old solution that s already in the case 
Preventing viral outbreaksSome forms of viral keratitis can t be completely eliminated 
Only use eye drops that have been prescribed by an eye doctor 
A cone shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare 
However, it can affect one eye more than the other 
It generally begins to affect people between the late teens and years of age 
The condition may progress slowly for years or longer 
If your condition gets worse, you may need a cornea transplant 
This treatment may be offered in addition to the vision correction options above 
Increased sensitivity to bright light and glare, which can cause problems with night driving 
Your eye doctor also may look for signs of keratoconus during routine eye exams 
Around in people with keratoconus also has a parent with the condition 
Risk factors These factors can increase your chances of developing keratoconus 
This causes fluid to enter the cornea, a condition known as hydrops 
A scarred cornea causes worsening vision problems and may require cornea transplant surgery 
Keratosis pilaris is often considered a common variant of skin 
SymptomsKeratosis pilaris can occur at any age, but it s more common in young children 
Painless tiny bumps on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks 
Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin 
When to see a doctorTreatment for keratosis pilaris usually isn t needed 
The keratin blocks the opening of hair follicles, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin 
It s not clear why keratin builds up in people with keratosis pilaris 
It might happen along with a genetic disease or skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis 
Seborrheic keratosis Overview A seborrheic keratosis seb o REE ik ker uh TOE sis is a common noncancerous benign skin growth 
People tend to get more of them as they get older 
The growths lesions look waxy or scaly and slightly raised 
They appear gradually, usually on the face, neck, chest or back 
Varied size, from very small to more than inch centimeters across 
Varied number, ranging from a single growth to multiple growths 
Varied in color, ranging from light tan to brown or black 
Causes Experts don t completely understand what causes a seborrheic keratosis 
If you ve had one seborrheic keratosis, you re at risk of developing others 
Risk factors The peak time for developing seborrheic keratoses is after your s 
Overview A kidney infection is a type of urinary tract infection UTI 
If not treated properly, an infection can cause lasting damage to the kidneys 
Or the bacteria can spread to the bloodstream and cause a dangerous infection 
Kidney infection treatment often includes antibiotics, which might be given in the hospital 
They may include blood poisoning, damage to the body s tissues or death 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of a kidney infection include 
That makes it easier for bacteria to travel from outside the body to the bladder 
Once in the bladder, an infection can spread to the kidneys 
Pregnant women are at even higher risk of a kidney infection 
This includes a kidney stone, a narrowed urethra or an enlarged prostate gland 
Medical conditions such as diabetes and HIV can weaken the immune system 
These include drugs taken after an organ transplant that help prevent rejection 
Nerve or spinal cord damage can block the feeling of a bladder infection 
That can make it hard to know when an infection travels to a kidney 
Urinary catheters are tubes used to drain urine from the bladder 
Catheters are sometimes used after a surgical procedure or diagnostic test 
They re also used in people who are confined to a bed 
Having a condition that causes urine to flow the wrong way 
Complications If left untreated, a kidney infection can lead to potentially serious complications, such as 
This can lead to chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure and kidney failure 
A kidney infection can cause bacteria to spread through the bloodstream 
PreventionReduce your risk of kidney infection by taking steps to prevent urinary tract infections 
Women in particular may lower the risk of urinary tract infections if they 
Fluids can help remove bacteria from the body when you urinate 
Urinating as soon as possible after sex helps clear bacteria from the urethra 
Wipe from front to back after urinating and after a bowel movement 
Deodorant sprays in the genital area or douches can be irritating 
Often, stones form when the urine becomes concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together 
The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder 
Severe, sharp pain in the side and back, below the ribs 
A persistent need to urinate, urinating more often than usual or urinating in small amounts 
Pain so severe that you can t sit still or find a comfortable position 
Most kidney stones are calcium stones, usually in the form of calcium oxalate 
Oxalate is a substance made daily by your liver or absorbed from your diet 
Certain fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and chocolate, have high oxalate content 
Calcium stones may also occur in the form of calcium phosphate 
This type of stone is more common in metabolic conditions, such as renal tubular acidosis 
Struvite stones form in response to a urinary tract infection 
Certain genetic factors also may increase your risk of uric acid stones 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing kidney stones include 
Not drinking enough water each day can increase your risk of kidney stones 
Mononucleosis Overview Infectious mononucleosis mono is often called the kissing disease 
The virus that causes mono Epstein Barr virus is spread through saliva 
However, mononucleosis isn t as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold 
Young children usually have few symptoms, and the infection often goes undiagnosed 
Sore throat, perhaps misdiagnosed as strep throat, that doesn t get better after treatment with antibiotics 
When to see your doctorIf you ve been experiencing the above symptoms, you may have mononucleosis 
Most adults have been exposed to the Epstein Barr virus and have built up antibodies 
Complications Complications of mononucleosis can sometimes be serious 
Enlargement of the spleenMononucleosis may cause enlargement of the spleen 
If such pain occurs, seek medical attention immediately you may need surgery 
A yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes jaundice also occurs occasionally 
Less common complicationsMononucleosis can also result in less common complications, including 
Thrombocytopenia a low count of platelets, which are blood cells involved in clotting 
Heart problems an inflammation of the heart muscle myocarditis 
Complications involving the nervous system meningitis, encephalitis and Guillain Barre syndrome 
And remember to wash your hands regularly to prevent spread of the virus 
The Epstein Barr virus may persist in your saliva for months after the infection 
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition affecting males, and it often isn t diagnosed until adulthood 
The effects of Klinefelter syndrome vary, and not everyone has the same signs and symptoms 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome vary widely among males with the disorder 
Many boys with Klinefelter syndrome show few or only mild signs 
The condition may go undiagnosed until adulthood or it may never be diagnosed 
For others, the condition has a noticeable effect on growth or appearance 
Signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome also vary by age 
Slow motor development taking longer than average to sit up, crawl and walk 
Problems at birth, such as testicles that haven t descended into the scrotum 
Longer legs, shorter torso and broader hips compared with other boys 
After puberty, less muscle and less facial and body hair compared with other teens 
When to see a doctorSee a doctor if you or your son has 
Humans have chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes that determine a person s sex 
Males have an X and a Y sex chromosome XY 
One extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell XXY , the most common cause 
An extra X chromosome in some of the cells mosaic Klinefelter syndrome , with fewer symptoms 
Risk factors Klinefelter syndrome stems from a random genetic event 
The risk of Klinefelter syndrome isn t increased by anything a parent does or doesn t do 
For older mothers, the risk is higher but only slightly 
Social, emotional and behavioral problems, such as low self esteem, emotional immaturity and impulsiveness 
Tooth and oral problems that make dental cavities more likely 
A number of complications caused by Klinefelter syndrome are related to low testosterone hypogonadism 
These findings most often affect one leg but may occur in an arm or elsewhere 
These include swollen, twisted veins varicose veins , usually on the surface of the legs 
Deeper malformed veins in the arms, legs, abdomen and pelvis also can occur 
There may be spongy tissue filled with small veins in or under the skin 
This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity 
Rarely, there may be fusion of fingers or toes or extra fingers or toes 
When to see a doctorKTS is usually identified at birth 
It involves genetic changes mutations , most commonly in the PIK CA gene 
A change in this gene results in overgrowth of tissues 
The gene changes occur randomly during cell division in early development before birth 
Varicose veins can cause pain and skin ulcers due to poor circulation 
Venous malformations in the pelvis and abdominal organs can cause internal bleeding 
Superficial veins can develop less serious but painful clots and inflammation superficial thrombophlebitis 
Overview Knee pain is a common complaint that affects people of all ages 
Medical conditions including arthritis, gout and infections also can cause knee pain 
Many types of minor knee pain respond well to self care measures 
Physical therapy and knee braces also can help relieve pain 
In some cases, however, your knee may require surgical repair 
Have a fever, in addition to redness, pain and swelling in your knee 
Have severe knee pain that is associated with an injury 
It can be torn if you suddenly twist your knee while bearing weight on it 
Runners, skiers, cyclists, and those involved in jumping sports and activities may develop patellar tendinitis 
Mechanical problemsSome examples of mechanical problems that can cause knee pain include 
Distance runners and cyclists are especially susceptible to iliotibial band syndrome 
Types of arthritisMore than different types of arthritis exist 
Sometimes called degenerative arthritis, osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis 
This type of arthritis occurs when uric acid crystals build up in the joint 
While gout most commonly affects the big toe, it can also occur in the knee 
Sometimes your knee joint can become infected, leading to swelling, pain and redness 
Septic arthritis can quickly cause extensive damage to the knee cartilage 
A lack of strength and flexibility can increase the risk of knee injuries 
Some sports put greater stress on your knees than do others 
Having a previous knee injury makes it more likely that you ll injure your knee again 
To prepare your muscles for the demands of sports participation, take time for conditioning 
Balance and stability training helps the muscles around your knees work together more effectively 
And because tight muscles also can contribute to injury, stretching is important 
As a result, they have diarrhea, gas and bloating after eating or drinking dairy products 
You can have low levels of lactase and still be able to digest milk products 
Infants, who get all their nutrition from milk, need lactase 
Premature infants can also have lactose intolerance because of an insufficient lactase level 
Lactose intolerance is most common in people of African, Asian, Hispanic and American Indian descent 
Lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Women with LCIS have an increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer in either breast 
If LCIS is detected in a breast biopsy, it doesn t mean that you have cancer 
Your individual risk of breast cancer is based on many factors 
Talk to your doctor to better understand your personal risk of breast cancer 
Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems 
Signs and symptoms usually don t appear until dangerous amounts have accumulated 
Lead poisoning symptoms in childrenSigns and symptoms of lead poisoning in children include 
Eating things, such as paint chips, that aren t food pica 
Lead poisoning symptoms in newbornsBabies exposed to lead before birth might 
But lead based paint is still on walls and woodwork in many older homes and apartments 
Most lead poisoning in children results from eating chips of deteriorating lead based paint 
Other sources of lead exposureLead sometimes can also be found in 
Lead particles from leaded gasoline or paint settle on soil and can last years 
Lead contaminated soil is still a major problem around highways and in some urban settings 
Some soil close to walls of older houses contains lead 
Lead is sometimes found in toys and other products produced abroad 
Tiro, an eye cosmetic from Nigeria, has been linked to lead poisoning 
Tamarind, an ingredient used in some candies made in Mexico, might contain lead 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of lead poisoning include 
People renovating an older home are at even higher risk 
Making stained glass and some jewelry requires the use of lead solder 
Refinishing old furniture might put you in contact with layers of lead paint 
Developing countries often have less strict rules regarding exposure to lead than do developed countries 
If you re pregnant or planning a pregnancy, be especially careful to avoid exposure to lead 
The greatest risk is to brain development, where irreversible damage can occur 
Higher levels can damage the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults 
Very high lead levels may cause seizures, unconsciousness and death 
PreventionSimple measures can help protect you and your family from lead poisoning 
Don t use hot tap water to make baby formula or for cooking 
Provide them with a sandbox that s covered when not in use 
Regular meals and good nutrition might help lower lead absorption 
If your home has lead based paint, check regularly for peeling paint and fix problems promptly 
Try not to sand, which generates dust particles that contain lead 
Overview Left ventricular hypertrophy is thickening of the walls of the lower left heart chamber 
During left ventricular hypertrophy, the thickened heart wall can become stiff 
The changes make it harder for the heart to effectively pump blood 
Eventually, the heart may fail to pump with as much force as needed 
Uncontrolled high blood pressure is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy 
Complications include irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, and heart failure 
Some people do not have symptoms, especially during the early stages of the condition 
But symptoms may occur as the strain on the heart worsens 
You feel chest pain that lasts more than a few minutes 
Sometimes, the size of the heart chamber itself also increases 
Also called hypertension, this is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy 
Intense, long term strength and endurance training causes changes in the heart 
The changes help the heart adapt to the extra physical workload 
But the changes can make the heart muscle grow larger 
Sometimes this is called athlete s heart or athletic heart syndrome 
This condition is caused by changes in genes that cause the heart muscle to thicken 
The thickening makes it harder for the heart to pump blood 
When the condition is passed down through families, it is called familial amyloidosis 
The inherited disorder also may affect the nerves and kidneys 
Risk factors Things that increase the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy include 
So is high blood pressure, which can cause heart muscle thickening 
Being overweight increases the risk of high blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy 
Changes in genes passed down through families may lead to left ventricular hypertrophy 
Complications Left ventricular hypertrophy changes the structure and function of the heart 
This prevents the lower left heart chamber from filling properly with blood 
As a result of these changes, complications of left ventricular hypertrophy include 
Too little oxygen to the heart, called ischemic heart disease 
Sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness, called sudden cardiac arrest 
To prevent left ventricular hypertrophy caused by high blood pressure 
Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy 
Your provider may recommend checking your blood pressure at home 
Home blood pressure monitoring devices are available at local stores and pharmacies 
This weakened bone gradually breaks apart and can lose its round shape 
The body eventually restores blood supply to the ball, and the ball heals 
The complete process of bone death, fracture and renewal can take several years 
The socket acts as a mold for the fragmented femoral head as it heals 
Pain or stiffness in the hip, groin, thigh or knee 
Both hips are affected in some children, usually at different times 
Without enough blood, this bone becomes weak and fractures easily 
The cause of the temporary reduction in blood flow to the femoral head remains unknown 
Risk factors Risk factors for Legg Calve Perthes disease include 
Legg Calve Perthes is about four times more common in boys than in girls 
White children are more likely to develop the disorder than are black children 
If the hipbones don t fit together well after healing, the joint can wear out early 
Most people catch Legionnaires disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil 
Older adults, smokers and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to Legionnaires disease 
The legionella bacterium also causes Pontiac fever, a milder illness resembling the flu 
Pontiac fever usually clears on its own, but untreated Legionnaires disease can be fatal 
SymptomsLegionnaires disease usually develops two to days after exposure to legionella bacteria 
Fever that may be F C or higher 
By the second or third day, you ll develop other signs and symptoms that can include 
Pontiac fever doesn t infect your lungs, and symptoms usually clear within two to five days 
For people at high risk, such as smokers or older adults, prompt treatment is critical 
Causes The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is responsible for most cases of Legionnaires disease 
Outdoors, legionella bacteria survive in soil and water, but rarely cause infections 
However, legionella bacteria can multiply in water systems made by humans, such as air conditioners 
Also, home and car air conditioning units don t use water for cooling 
Besides by breathing in water droplets, the infection can be transmitted in other ways, including 
If you aspirate water containing legionella bacteria, you can develop Legionnaires disease 
Risk factors Not everyone exposed to legionella bacteria becomes sick 
Smoking damages the lungs, making you more susceptible to all types of lung infections 
Complications Legionnaires disease can lead to a number of life threatening complications, including 
This is the sudden loss of your kidneys ability to filter waste from your blood 
When your kidneys fail, dangerous levels of fluid and waste accumulate in your body 
LeiomyosarcomaLeiomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in smooth muscle tissue 
Signs and symptoms of leiomyosarcoma depend on where the cancer starts 
Imaging tests might include MRI, CT and positron emission tomography PET 
A biopsy procedure involves removing a sample of suspicious tissue for testing 
The sample is sent to a lab where it s analyzed to see if it s leiomyosarcoma 
Your doctor also considers your overall health and your preferences when creating a treatment plan 
The goal of surgery is to remove all of the leiomyosarcoma 
Instead, your surgeon may remove as much of the cancer as possible 
Radiation therapy might be recommended after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain 
Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses powerful chemicals to kill cancer cells 
Targeted drug therapy might be an option for advanced leiomyosarcoma 
Overview Leukoplakia loo koh PLAY key uh causes thick, white patches that form on the gums 
Cancers in the mouth can occur next to areas of leukoplakia 
White areas mixed with red areas, also called speckled leukoplakia, may possibly lead to cancer 
Usually it is not painful and it may not be noticed for a while 
Patches with a rough, ridged, wrinkled or smooth surface, or a combination of these 
White patches of leukoplakia may appear along with raised, red areas called erythroplakia uh rith roe PLAY key uh 
These patches are more likely to show changes that may lead to cancer 
Hairy leukoplakiaHairy leukoplakia causes fuzzy, white patches that look like folds or ridges 
The patches usually form on the sides of the tongue 
Oral thrush also is common in people with weak immune systems 
See your doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any of these 
Changes in the inside of the mouth that do not go away 
A betel nut packet, like smokeless tobacco, is held between the gum and cheek 
Hairy leukoplakiaHairy leukoplakia results from infection with the Epstein Barr virus EBV 
Once you ve been infected with EBV, the virus remains in your body for life 
Usually the virus is not active and does not cause symptoms 
But if your immune system is weakened, especially from HIV AIDS, the virus can become active 
Drinking alcohol combined with using tobacco increases your risk even more 
Hairy leukoplakiaPeople with HIV AIDS are especially likely to develop hairy leukoplakia 
But it still affects many people who are HIV positive 
It may be one of the early signs of HIV infection 
Complications Leukoplakia usually does not cause permanent damage to the inside of the mouth 
Even after leukoplakia patches are removed, the risk of mouth cancer remains 
Hairy leukoplakiaHairy leukoplakia is not likely to lead to cancer 
Talk to your doctor or other healthcare professional about ways to help you quit 
If you continue to smoke or chew tobacco or drink alcohol, have dental checkups often 
Quitting tobacco and alcohol is a better way to prevent mouth cancers 
But finding it early can help you get proper treatment 
Overview Lice are tiny, wingless insects that feed on human blood 
Lice spread from person to person through close contact and by sharing belongings 
They re easiest to see at the nape of the neck and over the ears 
Body lice that live in clothing and bedding and move onto the skin to feed 
Intense itching on the scalp, body or in the genital area 
The presence of lice on your scalp, body, clothing, or pubic or other body hair 
Adult lice may be about the size of a sesame seed or slightly larger 
Nits may be difficult to see because they re very tiny 
They re easiest to spot around the ears and the nape of the neck 
Scratching can lead to small red bumps that can sometimes get infected with bacteria 
Bite marks, especially around the waist, groin, upper thighs and pubic area 
You can get lice by coming into contact with either lice or their eggs 
This may occur as children or family members play or interact closely 
These may include clothing, headphones, brushes, combs, hair accessories, towels, blankets, pillows and stuffed toys 
Lice can live for to days off the body 
Pubic lice found on children may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse 
There s so much close contact among children and their belongings that lice can spread easily 
The presence of head lice isn t a reflection of hygiene habits 
It s also not a failure on the parent if a child gets head lice 
But more research is needed to prove their safety and effectiveness 
Their safety and effectiveness haven t been tested to FDA standards 
Ask your child to avoid head to head contact with classmates during play and other activities 
Mild lichen planus of the skin may not need treatment 
If the condition causes pain or intense itching, you may need prescription medicine 
SymptomsSymptoms of lichen planus vary depending on the part of the body affected 
Purple, shiny, flat bumps, often on the inner forearms, wrists or ankles 
Lacy white patches on the tongue or inside of the cheeks 
Dark lines from the tip of the nail to the base 
Lichen planus in the mouth is more likely to affect women than men 
Complications Lichen planus can be difficult to treat on the vulva and in the vagina 
The affected skin and nails might stay slightly darker even after healing 
Oral lichen planus may appear as white, lacy patches red, swollen tissues or open sores 
Oral lichen planus can t be passed from one person to another 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of oral lichen planus affect the mucous membranes of the mouth 
However, symptoms accompanying red, swollen patches and open sores may include 
Lesions usually appear as purplish, flat topped bumps that are often itchy 
Lesions on the female genitalia often cause pain or burning and discomfort with intercourse 
The lesions are usually red and eroded and occasionally appear as white areas 
Lichen planus of the ears can lead to hearing loss 
When skin lesions appear on the scalp, they may cause temporary or permanent hair loss 
This could indicate an immune disorder, and genetic factors may be involved 
But more research is needed to determine the exact cause 
Stress may be involved in symptoms becoming worse or recurring 
Complications Severe cases of oral lichen planus may increase the risk of 
Overview Lichen sclerosus LIE kun skluh ROW sus is a condition that causes patchy, discolored, thin skin 
Anyone can get lichen sclerosus but postmenopausal women are at higher risk 
It isn t contagious and can t be spread through sexual contact 
Even if your symptoms clear up, they tend to come back 
SymptomsIt s possible to have mild lichen sclerosus with no symptoms 
When symptoms do occur, they usually affect the skin of the genital and anal areas 
The back, shoulders, upper arms and breasts may also be affected 
These visits are important to check for any skin changes or side effects of treatment 
Lichen sclerosus isn t contagious and can t be spread through sexual contact 
Risk factors Anyone can get lichen sclerosus, but the risk is higher for 
Women who have another autoimmune disease, such as forms of low thyroid function hypothyroidism 
People with vulvar lichen sclerosus are also at an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma 
Overview Lip cancer occurs on the skin of the lips 
Lip cancer is considered a type of mouth oral cancer 
Lip cancer risk factors include excessive sun exposure and tobacco use 
Treatment for lip cancer usually involves surgery to remove the cancer 
For larger lip cancers, more extensive surgery may be necessary 
A flat or slightly raised whitish discoloration of the lip 
Tingling, pain or numbness of the lips or the skin around the mouth 
In general, cancer starts when cells develop changes mutations in their DNA 
The accumulating cells form a tumor that can invade and destroy normal body tissue 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of lip cancer include 
Tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of lip cancer 
A lipoma, which feels doughy and usually isn t tender, moves readily with slight finger pressure 
They commonly occur in the neck, shoulders, back, abdomen, arms and thighs 
Lipomas are typically less than inches centimeters in diameter, but they can grow 
When to see a doctorA lipoma is rarely a serious medical condition 
Risk factors Several factors may increase your risk of developing a lipoma, including 
Although lipomas can occur at any age, they re most common in this age group 
Overview Liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the fat cells 
But liposarcoma can begin in the fat cells anywhere in the body 
Liposarcoma happens most often in older adults, but it can happen at any age 
Other treatments, such as radiation therapy, also may be used 
Liposarcoma is a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma 
SymptomsLiposarcoma symptoms depend on the part of the body where the cancer forms 
Liposarcoma in the belly, also called the abdomen, can cause 
Liposarcoma starts when fat cells get changes in their DNA 
In some types of liposarcoma, the cancer cells stay put 
They continue making more cells, causing the tumor to get bigger 
When cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it s called metastatic cancer 
It s most commonly caused by eating improperly processed deli meats and unpasteurized milk products 
Prompt antibiotic treatment can help curb the effects of listeria infection 
If the listeria infection spreads to your nervous system, signs and symptoms can include 
If you have a fever, muscle aches, nausea or diarrhea, contact your doctor 
These signs and symptoms can indicate bacterial meningitis, a life threatening complication of a listeria infection 
Causes Listeria bacteria can be found in soil, water and animal feces 
Unborn babies can contract a listeria infection from the mother 
People who have weak immune systemsThis category includes people who 
Complications Most listeria infections are so mild they can go unnoticed 
However, in some cases, a listeria infection can lead to life threatening complications, including 
Inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain meningitis 
PreventionTo prevent a listeria infection, follow simple food safety guidelines 
Wash your hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water before and after handling or preparing food 
Clean raw vegetables with a scrub brush or vegetable brush under plenty of running water 
Keep fluid from hot dog packages away from other foods, utensils and food preparation surfaces 
These products can be labeled as nova style, lox, kippered or jerky 
Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis 
But early treatment may give the liver time to heal 
SymptomsLiver disease doesn t always cause symptoms that can be seen or felt 
If there are symptoms of liver disease, they may include 
Yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black or brown skin 
InfectionParasites and viruses can infect the liver, causing swelling and irritation, called inflammation 
The most common types of liver infection are hepatitis viruses, including 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of liver disease include 
Complications Complications of liver disease depend on the cause of the liver problems 
If you get tattoos or body piercings, pick a shop that s clean and safe 
This also is true if you ve been infected with any form of the hepatitis virus 
Talk with your healthcare provider before mixing herbal supplements or prescription or other medicines 
Make sure to use these products in an open area 
Wear a mask when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals 
Obesity can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, now called metabolic associated steatotic liver disease 
Overview Morphea mor FEE uh is a rare condition that causes painless, discolored patches on your skin 
Typically, the skin changes appear on the belly, chest or back 
But they might also appear on your face, arms and legs 
Over time the patches may become firm, dry and smooth 
Morphea tends to affect only the outer layers of your skin 
Morphea usually improves on its own over time, though recurrences are common 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition 
Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back 
Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp 
A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny 
Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone 
The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself 
It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system 
Risk factors Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including 
It usually appears between the ages of and or in the mid s 
Morphea that affects the arms or legs can impair joint mobility 
Over time, you may lose hair and sweat glands in the affected area 
Children with head and neck morphea may experience unnoticeable but permanent eye damage 
Overview Tetanus is a serious disease of the nervous system caused by a toxin producing bacterium 
The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles 
Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve 
The disease remains a threat to people who aren t up to date on their vaccinations 
The incubation period can range from to days 
The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus 
Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks 
They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body 
Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles muscle rigidity in your jaw 
Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin 
Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties 
As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include 
While it s usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus 
Cephalic tetanusThis rare form of tetanus results from a head wound 
It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles 
If you have signs or symptoms of tetanus, seek emergency care 
You are unsure of when you last had a tetanus shot 
Causes The bacterium that causes tetanus is called Clostridium tetani 
The bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces 
It s essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive 
As they are growing and dividing, they release a toxin called tetanospasmin 
The toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles 
Other factors that increase the risk of tetanus infection are 
A foreign body in a wound, such as a nail or splinter 
An infected umbilical cord when a mother isn t fully vaccinated 
Generalized spasms may cause fractures of the spine or other bones 
Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection of the nose and throat 
Acellular pertussis, also called whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory infection 
Children who do not tolerate the pertussis vaccine may receive the alternative vaccine called DT 
This may be one of two vaccines, Tdap or Td 
Check whether you are current on your vaccination schedule if you are planning international travel 
A heart signaling disorder is also called a heart conduction disorder 
Young people with LQTS syndrome have an increased risk of sudden death 
Treatment for long QT syndrome includes lifestyle changes and medications to prevent dangerous heartbeats 
Sometimes surgery is needed to implant a device to control the heart s rhythm 
SymptomsSome people with long QT syndrome LQTS do not have any noticeable symptoms 
Fainting syncope is the most common symptom of long QT syndrome 
A fainting spell from long QT syndrome can occur with little to no warning 
Fainting occurs when the heart temporarily beats in an unorganized way 
You might faint when you re excited, angry or scared or during exercise 
Long QT syndrome may also cause seizures in some people 
Most people with symptoms of LQTS have their first episode by age 
Generally, after a long QT episode, the heart returns to its typical rhythm 
In a typical heart, the heart sends blood out to the body during each heartbeat 
The heart s chambers squeeze contract and relax to pump the blood 
This coordinated action is controlled by the heart s electrical system 
Electrical signals impulses travel from the top to the bottom of the heart 
After each heartbeat, the system recharges to prepare for the next heartbeat 
Long QT syndrome is often grouped into two main categories, depending on the cause 
If you are born with the condition, it s called congenital long QT syndrome 
If an underlying medical condition or medication causes it, it s called acquired long QT syndrome 
In this syndrome, children receive the altered gene variants from both parents 
The children are born with long QT syndrome and deafness 
Certain antibiotics, such as erythromycin Eryc, Erythrocin, others , azithromycin Zithromax and others 
Diuretics that cause an electrolyte imbalance low potassium, most commonly 
Health conditions that can lead to acquired long QT syndrome include 
Body temperature below degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius , a condition called hypothermia 
The following things may increase the risk of developing long QT syndrome 
Having a parent, sibling or child with long QT syndrome 
Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, which cause electrolyte imbalances 
If you have long QT syndrome and are considering pregnancy, tell your health care provider 
The lack of blood to the brain causes sudden fainting, often without warning 
There is no known prevention for congenital long QT syndrome 
Families with inherited long QT syndrome might consider genetic screening 
Overview Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which you have a low blood platelet count 
Platelets thrombocytes are colorless blood cells that help blood clot 
Platelets stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessel injuries 
Or it can be a side effect of taking certain medications 
Thrombocytopenia can be mild and cause few signs or symptoms 
Causes Thrombocytopenia means you have fewer than , platelets per microliter of circulating blood 
Normally, your spleen works to fight infection and filter unwanted material from your blood 
Decreased production of plateletsPlatelets are produced in your bone marrow 
Thrombocytopenia caused by pregnancy is usually mild and improves soon after childbirth 
Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, cause this type 
If the exact cause of this condition isn t known, it s called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 
Severe bacterial infections involving the blood bacteremia can destroy platelets 
Certain medications can reduce the number of platelets in your blood 
Sometimes a drug confuses the immune system and causes it to destroy platelets 
Though rare, severe thrombocytopenia can cause bleeding into the brain, which can be fatal 
SymptomsThe main sign of low sperm count is the inability to conceive a child 
Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosome or hormone abnormality 
Problems with any of these systems can affect sperm production 
Also, there can be problems of abnormal sperm shape morphology , movement motility or function 
However, often the cause of low sperm count isn t identified 
A varicocele VAR ih koe seel is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle 
Some ejaculatory problems can be reversed, while others are permanent 
Surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors also can affect male fertility 
Decreased fertility is more likely in men with this condition 
The hypothalamus, pituitary and testicles produce hormones that are necessary to create sperm 
Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis, Kallmann s syndrome and Kartagener s syndrome 
A digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, celiac disease can cause male infertility 
Environmental causesSperm production or function can be affected by overexposure to certain environmental elements, including 
Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also can cause infertility 
It can take several years for sperm production to return to normal 
Health, lifestyle and other causesOther causes of low sperm count include 
Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels and cause decreased sperm production 
Men who smoke might have a lower sperm count than do those who don t smoke 
Surgery or other treatments for an underlying cause of low sperm count 
Expensive and involved assisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization IVF 
PreventionTo protect your fertility, avoid known factors that can affect sperm count and quality 
Talk to your doctor about medications that can affect sperm count 
Some types of male hypogonadism can be treated with testosterone replacement therapy 
SymptomsHypogonadism can begin during fetal development, before puberty or during adulthood 
Genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female ambiguous genitals 
PubertyMale hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development 
Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body 
AdulthoodIn adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function 
As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women 
When to seek helpSee your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism 
Finding the cause of hypogonadism is an important first step to getting appropriate treatment 
Causes Male hypogonadism means the testicles don t produce enough of the male sex hormone testosterone 
Sometimes one or both of the testicles aren t descended at birth 
This condition often corrects itself within the first few years of life without treatment 
Because they re outside the abdomen, the testicles are prone to injury 
Damage to one testicle might not impair total testosterone production 
The effects of both treatments often are temporary, but permanent infertility may occur 
This abnormality can also affect the ability to smell anosmia and cause red green color blindness 
Being significantly overweight at any age might be linked to hypogonadism 
As men age, there s a slow, progressive decrease in testosterone production 
Risk factors Risk factors for hypogonadism include 
If any of these risk factors are in your family health history, tell your doctor 
While there s no cure for lupus, treatments can help control symptoms 
It s likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment 
The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown 
Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people 
Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti seizure medications and antibiotics 
People who have drug induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication 
Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of lupus include 
Lupus is more common in African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans 
Complications Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many areas of your body, including your 
Many people with lupus experience memory problems and may have difficulty expressing their thoughts 
Lupus can cause inflammation of your heart muscle, your arteries or heart membrane 
The risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks increases greatly as well 
Other types of complicationsHaving lupus also increases your risk of 
Having lupus appears to increase your risk of cancer however, the risk is small 
Lupus increases the risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy and preterm birth 
Lupus causes the immune system to make proteins called autoantibodies 
These proteins attack tissues and organs in the body, including the kidneys 
Lupus nephritis occurs when lupus autoantibodies affect parts of the kidneys that filter out waste 
This causes swelling and irritation of the kidneys, called inflammation 
Swelling in the legs, ankles or feet and sometimes in the hands and face 
High levels of a waste product called creatinine in the blood 
Causes As many as half of adults with systemic lupus get lupus nephritis 
Systemic lupus causes the body s immune system to damage the kidneys 
Then the kidneys can t filter out waste as they should 
Risk factors The only known risk factors for lupus nephritis are 
Overview Lyme disease is an illness caused by borrelia bacteria 
Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria 
Ticks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States 
It s also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada 
Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease 
Many people will not notice they ve had a tick bite 
And some people don t have symptoms of the typical early stage 
This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms 
It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull s eye 
The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it s usually not painful or itchy 
The symptoms often show up within to weeks after a tick bite 
Stage may include the stage symptoms and the following 
Muscle weakness on one or both sides of the face 
Pain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs 
Immune system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss 
Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time 
Stage symptoms usually begin to months after a tick bite 
It also may show up over the elbows and knees 
This skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite 
And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions 
See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms 
If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible 
In North America, the black legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria 
In Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease 
Tick bitesTicks feed on blood by attaching to a host s skin 
The tick feeds until it s swollen to many times its typical size 
Deer ticks can feed on a host s blood for several days 
Ticks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent 
You may not notice if a young tick bites you 
The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall 
But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing 
Complications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment 
Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS 
Immune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity 
Conditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed 
Shower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks 
Swollen lymph nodes Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
If an infection causes swollen lymph nodes, treatment depends on the cause 
Many lymph nodes are located in your head and neck region 
Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that something is wrong somewhere in your body 
Runny nose, sore throat, fever and other indications of an upper respiratory infection 
Hard, fixed, rapidly growing nodes, indicating a possible cancer or lymphoma 
See your doctor if you re concerned or if your swollen lymph nodes 
Continue to enlarge or have been present for two to four weeks 
Feel hard or rubbery, or don t move when you push on them 
Are accompanied by persistent fever, night sweats or unexplained weight loss 
Seek immediate medical care if you re having difficulty swallowing or breathing 
Causes Lymph nodes are small, round or bean shaped clusters of cells 
Inside lymph nodes are a combination of different types of immune system cells 
The site of the swollen lymph nodes may help identify the underlying cause 
Human immunodeficiency virus HIV the virus that causes AIDS 
Cat scratch fever a bacterial infection from a cat scratch or bite 
Rheumatoid arthritis a chronic inflammatory disease targeting the tissue that lines your joints synovium 
Leukemia cancer of your body s blood forming tissue, including your bone marrow and lymphatic system 
Risk factors Many conditions increase the risk of swollen lymph nodes 
Factors that increase the risk of having these conditions include 
Aging increases the risk of getting infections, immune system disorders and cancer 
This can be from an illness or a medicine that suppresses the immune system 
Having a weakened immune system increases the risk of infections 
Pus contains fluid, white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other invaders 
Lymph nodes are an important part of your lymphatic system 
Lymphedema can be caused by cancer treatments that remove or damage your lymph nodes 
Any type of problem that blocks the drainage of lymph fluid can cause lymphedema 
Swelling of part or all of the arm or leg, including fingers or toes 
Lymphedema caused by cancer treatment may not occur until months or years after treatment 
Lymph nodes act as filters and contain cells that fight infection and cancer 
Radiation can cause scarring and inflammation of lymph nodes or lymph vessels 
In cancer surgery, lymph nodes are often removed to see if the disease has spread 
Less commonly, lymphedema results from inherited conditions in which the lymphatic system doesn t develop properly 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of developing lymphedema include 
Affected skin appears swollen and red and is typically painful and warm to the touch 
The lymphatic system includes the lymph nodes lymph glands , spleen, thymus gland and bone marrow 
Lymphoma can affect all those areas as well as other organs throughout the body 
What lymphoma treatment is best for you depends on your lymphoma type and its severity 
The mutation tells the cell to multiply rapidly, causing many diseased lymphocytes that continue multiplying 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of lymphoma include 
Males are slightly more likely to develop lymphoma than are females 
In Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, some white blood cells undergo changes that turn them into cancer cells 
The cancer cells crowd healthy blood cells out of the bone marrow 
The cancer cells make a protein that can build up in the blood 
Causes Cancer happens when cells develop changes in their DNA 
The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural lifecycle 
In Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, the changes happen in the white blood cells 
The changes turn some of the white blood cells into cancer cells 
The cancer cells also may build up in the lymph nodes and the spleen 
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells make a protein that the body can t use 
This may reduce blood flow in the body and cause other problems 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia include 
White people are more likely to develop the disease, compared with people of other races 
Malaria Overview Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite 
The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes 
People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills 
Protective clothing, bed nets and insecticides can protect you while traveling 
Many malaria parasites have developed resistance to common drugs used to treat the disease 
Some people who have malaria experience cycles of malaria attacks 
Causes Malaria is caused by a single celled parasite of the genus plasmodium 
The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites 
A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria 
If this mosquito bites you in the future, it can transmit malaria parasites to you 
When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells 
Risks of more severe diseasePeople at increased risk of serious disease include 
Complications Malaria can be fatal, particularly when caused by the plasmodium species common in Africa 
Accumulated fluid in your lungs pulmonary edema can make it difficult to breathe 
Malaria can damage the kidneys or liver or cause the spleen to rupture 
Very low blood sugar can result in coma or death 
Tuck in your shirt, and tuck pant legs into socks 
Use an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin 
Researchers are continuing to develop and study malaria vaccines to prevent infection 
Less often it can happen in the area behind the abdominal organs retroperitoneum 
Undifferentiated means the cells don t look like the body tissues in which they develop 
The cancer is called pleomorphic plee o MOR fik because the cells grow in multiple shapes and sizes 
SymptomsUndifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma symptoms depend on where the cancer occurs 
If it grows very large, there may be pain, tingling and numbness 
If it occurs in the abdomen, there may be pain, loss of appetite and constipation 
Doctors know this cancer begins when a cell develops changes in its DNA 
The changes tell the cell to multiply rapidly, creating a mass of abnormal cells tumor 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma include 
Malignant hyperthermia Overview Malignant hyperthermia is a severe reaction to certain drugs used for anesthesia 
Without prompt treatment, the complications caused by malignant hyperthermia can be fatal 
Genetic testing can reveal whether you have an affected gene 
Rapid, shallow breathing and problems with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide 
Other anesthesia drugs that don t trigger a reaction can be used instead 
The affected gene is most commonly inherited, usually from one parent who also has it 
If you have other relatives with MHS, your chance of having it is also increased 
A history of an event that is suspected to be malignant hyperthermia during anesthesia 
Certain muscle diseases and disorders caused by inherited gene changes 
Complications If not treated promptly, malignant hyperthermia can result in major complications, such as 
A rare condition that causes muscle cells to break down rhabdomyolysis 
Evaluating your risk of malignant hyperthermia allows your anesthesiologist to avoid certain anesthesia drugs 
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors used to be called neurofibrosarcomas 
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can happen anywhere in the body 
They mostly occur in the deep tissue of the arms, legs and trunk 
They tend to cause pain and weakness where they occur 
Surgery is the usual treatment for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors 
SymptomsMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors often cause symptoms that get worse quickly 
Weakness when trying to move the body part that has the tumor 
Causes It s not clear what causes most malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors 
The changes tell the cells to make more cells quickly 
These cells continue to live when healthy cells die as part of their life cycle 
The cells then can form a mass called a tumor 
The tumor can grow into and kill healthy body tissue 
In time, the cells can spread to other parts of the body 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors include 
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors occur more often in people with neurofibromatosis 
This condition increases the risk of tumors in the nerves 
Mammary duct ectasia Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The duct walls may thicken, and the duct may fill with fluid 
The milk duct may become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance 
SymptomsMammary duct ectasia often doesn t cause any signs or symptoms, but some people experience 
A dirty white, greenish or black nipple discharge from one or both nipples 
Signs and symptoms of mammary duct ectasia may improve on their own 
Mammary duct ectasia occurs when a milk duct beneath the nipple widens 
A newly inverted nipple may obstruct milk ducts, causing inflammation and infection 
Nipple discharge caused by mammary duct ectasia can be frustrating 
Fluid leaking from your nipples can cause embarrassing wetness and staining on your clothes 
Mammary duct ectasia can cause redness, swelling and tenderness around your nipples 
Having a history of mammary duct ectasia doesn t increase your risk of breast cancer 
Still, it s important to see your doctor promptly anytime you notice breast changes 
Marfan syndrome most commonly affects the heart, eyes, blood vessels and skeleton 
The damage caused by Marfan syndrome can be mild or severe 
Many people with Marfan syndrome eventually require preventive surgery to repair the aorta 
Some people experience only mild effects, but others develop life threatening complications 
Each child of an affected parent has a chance of inheriting the defective gene 
Cardiovascular complicationsThe most dangerous complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels 
The wall of the aorta is made up of layers 
This can cause severe pain in the chest or back 
People who have Marfan syndrome can have weak tissue in their heart valves 
This can produce stretching of the valve tissue and abnormal valve function 
When heart valves don t work properly, your heart often has to work harder to compensate 
People who have Marfan syndrome tend to develop these eye problems at a younger age 
Glaucoma causes the pressure within the eye to increase, which can damage the optic nerve 
Cataracts are cloudy areas in the eye s normally clear lens 
Skeletal complicationsMarfan syndrome increases the risk of abnormal curves in the spine, such as scoliosis 
Foot pain and low back pain are common with Marfan syndrome 
In NAFLD, too much fat builds up in the liver 
It is seen most often in people who are overweight or obese 
In the United States, about million people have NAFLD 
Some people with NAFLD can get nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, also called NASH 
This damage is like the damage caused by heavy alcohol use 
Experts also have recommended changing the name nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis MASH 
Possible symptoms of NASH and cirrhosis, or severe scarring, include 
Causes Experts don t know exactly why fat builds up in some livers and not others 
They also don t fully understand why some fatty livers turn into NASH 
Type diabetes, sometimes called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia 
These combined health problems may contribute to a fatty liver 
However, some people get NAFLD even if they do not have any risk factors 
Risk factors Many diseases and health problems can increase your risk of NAFLD, including 
Growth hormone deficiency, which means the body doesn t make enough hormones to grow 
It is hard to tell apart NAFLD from NASH without a clinical evaluation and testing 
Complications Severe liver scarring, or cirrhosis, is the main complication of NAFLD and NASH 
Cirrhosis happens because of liver injury, such as the damage caused by inflammation in NASH 
As the liver tries to stop inflammation, it creates areas of scarring, also called fibrosis 
With ongoing inflammation, fibrosis spreads and takes up more liver tissue 
If nothing is done to stop the scarring, cirrhosis can lead to 
Swollen veins in your esophagus, or esophageal varices, which can rupture and bleed 
Overactive spleen, or hypersplenism, which can cause too few blood platelets 
End stage liver failure, which means the liver has stopped working 
Eat a healthy diet that s rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats 
Avoid sugary drinks like soda, sports drinks, juices and sweet tea 
Drinking alcohol can damage your liver and should be avoided or minimized 
Get an OK from your health care team first if you haven t been exercising regularly 
Your metabolism involves the processes your body uses to produce energy 
Prevention and prompt treatment are essential regardless of blood sugar level 
MCAD deficiency is present from birth and is a lifelong condition 
Many other countries also provide routine newborn screening for MCAD deficiency 
SymptomsMCAD deficiency is usually first identified in babies and young children 
In rare cases, the disorder is not diagnosed until adulthood 
A sudden severe episode, called a metabolic crisis, can be due to 
Ongoing stomach and digestive problems that may cause vomiting and diarrhea 
Also, fatty acids can build up in body tissues and cause damage 
MCAD deficiency is caused by a change in the ACADM gene 
The condition is inherited from both parents in an autosomal recessive pattern 
If you inherit only one changed gene, you won t develop MCAD deficiency 
The child then inherits two copies of the gene one from each parent 
Complications If metabolic crisis caused by MCAD deficiency is left untreated, it can lead to 
Symptoms of the most common variety begin in childhood, mostly in boys 
But medications and therapy can help manage symptoms and slow the course of the disease 
SymptomsThe main sign of muscular dystrophy is progressive muscle weakness 
Although girls can be carriers and mildly affected, it s much more common in boys 
Signs and symptoms, which typically appear in early childhood, might include 
Symptoms generally begin in the teens but might not occur until the mid s or later 
This is characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions 
Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected 
People with this form typically have long, thin faces drooping eyelids and swanlike necks 
Muscle weakness typically begins in the face, hip and shoulders 
The shoulder blades might stick out like wings when arms are raised 
This type affects boys and girls and is apparent at birth or before age 
Causes Certain genes are involved in making proteins that protect muscle fibers 
Muscular dystrophy occurs when one of these genes is defective 
Risk factors Muscular dystrophy occurs in both sexes and in all ages and races 
However, the most common variety, Duchenne, usually occurs in young boys 
Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair 
Weakened muscles might be unable to hold the spine straight 
Muscular dystrophy can reduce the efficiency of the heart muscle 
If the muscles involved with swallowing are affected, nutritional problems and aspiration pneumonia can develop 
Measles Overview Measles is a childhood infection caused by a virus 
SymptomsMeasles signs and symptoms appear around to days after exposure to the virus 
A skin rash made up of large, flat blotches that often flow into one another 
The infection occurs in stages over to weeks 
There are no signs or symptoms of measles during this time 
This relatively mild illness may last to days 
The rash is made up of small red spots, some of which are slightly raised 
Spots and bumps in tight clusters give the skin a splotchy red appearance 
The rash gradually fades first from the face and last from the thighs and feet 
The infectious droplets can hang in the air for about an hour 
Risk factors Risk factors for measles include 
If you haven t had the measles vaccine, you re much more likely to get measles 
Diarrhea and vomiting can result in losing too much water from the body dehydration 
One of the most common complications of measles is a bacterial ear infection 
Measles may lead to irritation and swelling inflammation of the airways croup 
Measles can also cause inflammation of the voice box laryngitis 
Measles can commonly cause an infection in the lungs pneumonia 
About in , people with measles can develop a complication called encephalitis 
The condition can be especially dangerous for people with weakened immune systems 
Encephalitis may occur right after measles, or it might not occur until months later 
Measles vaccine in childrenThe measles vaccine is usually given as a combined measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine 
This vaccine may also include the chickenpox varicella vaccine measles mumps rubella varicella MMRV vaccine 
Proof of immunity protection from getting measles infection includes 
Lab tests that show you ve had measles in the past 
Preventing new infectionsGetting vaccinated with the measles vaccine is important for 
The incidence of measles in the U S recently increased significantly 
In , a now discredited study was published incorrectly linking autism to the measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine 
In , there were nearly , lab confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales 
But this coincidence in timing shouldn t be mistaken for a cause and effect relationship 
Shin splints are common in runners, dancers and military recruits 
The increased activity overworks the muscles, tendons and bone tissue 
Most cases of shin splints can be treated with rest, ice and other self care measures 
Wearing proper footwear and modifying your exercise routine can help prevent shin splints from recurring 
At first, the pain might stop when you stop exercising 
Risk factors You re more at risk of shin splints if 
You suddenly increase the duration, frequency or intensity of exercise 
You run on uneven terrain, such as hills, or hard surfaces, such as concrete 
In many cases, a slight change in your running can help decrease your risk 
Medication overuse headaches usually go away when you stop taking pain medicine 
They can depend on the type of headache being treated and the medicine used 
Improve with pain medicine but then return as the medicine wears off 
Is a new type of headache that s persistent, especially in someone older than 
Occurs when you re upright but goes away if you re lying flat 
You take a pain reliever for your headaches more than twice a week 
You need more than the recommended dose of nonprescription pain medicines to relieve your headaches 
Causes Experts don t yet know exactly why medication overuse headaches occur 
The risk of developing them varies depending on the medicine 
But most headache medicines have the potential to lead to medication overuse headaches, including 
This is especially true if you take more than the recommended daily dosages 
This group also includes combination prescription medicines that contain the sedative butalbital Butapap, Lanorinal, others 
Butalbital containing medicines have an especially high risk of causing medication overuse headaches 
Various migraine medicines have been linked with medication overuse headaches 
These medicines have a moderate risk of causing medication overuse headaches 
Daily doses of caffeine also may fuel medication overuse headaches 
Caffeine may come from coffee, soda, pain relievers and other products 
Read product labels to make sure you re not getting more caffeine than you realize 
Risk factors Risk factors for developing medication overuse headaches include 
A history of lifelong headaches, especially migraines, puts you at risk 
Risk also increases if you use simple painkillers more than days a month 
This is especially true if you use these medicines for three months or longer 
A history of alcohol use disorder or another substance use disorder puts you at risk 
Contact your health care provider if you need headache medicine more than twice a week 
Don t take medicines that contain butalbital or opioids unless it s necessary 
If you re not sure what triggers your headaches, keep a headache diary 
Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends 
Eat lunch and dinner at about the same time every day 
Be sure to drink plenty of water or other fluids that don t contain caffeine 
Physical activity causes the body to release chemicals that block pain signals to the brain 
With your health care provider s OK, choose activities you enjoy 
If you need to lose weight, find a program that works for you 
If you smoke, talk to your health care provider about quitting 
Smoking is linked to a higher risk of medication overuse headaches 
Medulloblastoma begins as a growth of cells, which is called a tumor 
The cells grow quickly and can spread to other parts of the brain 
Medulloblastomas don t usually spread to other parts of the body 
Medulloblastoma can happen at any age, but most often occurs in young children 
Though medulloblastoma is rare, it s the most common cancerous brain tumor in children 
During this exam, vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes are tested 
These tests may show pressure or blockages of the cerebrospinal fluid 
A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of the tumor for testing 
Biopsies for medulloblastoma are uncommon but might be used in certain situations 
A needle is used to take a sample of the tumor 
The sample is tested in a lab to see if it s a medulloblastoma 
The needle draws out cerebrospinal fluid from around the spinal cord 
The fluid is tested in a lab to look for tumor cells 
TreatmentTreatment for medulloblastoma usually includes surgery followed by radiation or chemotherapy, or both 
A medulloblastoma may grow to block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid 
This can cause a buildup of fluid that puts pressure on the brain 
The goal of surgery is to remove all of the medulloblastoma 
Typically, children and adults with medulloblastoma receive these medicines as an injection into veins 
Overview Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes 
Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color 
Melanoma typically starts on skin that s often exposed to the sun 
This includes the skin on the arms, back, face and legs 
Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat 
Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds 
Limiting exposure to UV light can help reduce the risk of melanoma 
The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under , especially women 
Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is found early 
The development of a new pigmented or unusual looking growth on the skin 
Melanomas most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun 
Melanomas also can happen in areas that aren t as exposed to the sun 
This includes the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and fingernail beds 
These hidden melanomas are more common in people with brown or Black skin 
Typical moles have a distinct border separating the mole from the surrounding skin 
They re oval or round and usually smaller than inch about millimeters in diameter 
Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 
By the time they are adults, most people have between and moles 
Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even go away with age 
They may have certain characteristics that indicate melanomas or other skin cancers 
Look for moles with unusual shapes, such as two very different looking halves 
Look for growths that have many colors or unusual color patterns 
Look for new growth in a mole larger than inch about millimeters 
Look for changes in symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding 
This tissue lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina 
It most often occurs in the layer of tissue beneath the white of the eye 
An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam 
Acral lentiginous melanoma tends to be very dark, flat and have very unusual borders 
It s more common in people of Asian descent and people with brown or Black skin 
Causes Melanoma happens when something changes healthy melanocytes into cancer cells 
Melanocytes are skin cells that make pigment that gives skin its color 
In healthy cells, DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate 
It s likely a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors 
Still, healthcare professionals believe exposure to ultraviolet light is the leading cause of melanoma 
This means that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of melanoma include 
One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma 
Having more than typical moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma 
Also, having a type of mole that isn t typical increases the risk of melanoma 
Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these moles tend to be larger than typical moles 
They may have unusual borders and a mixture of colors 
Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation 
People living closer to the earth s equator experience more direct sun rays 
Also, people who live at a higher elevation are more exposed to UV light 
Anyone can get melanoma, but it s most common in people with white skin 
PreventionYou can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you 
Tanning lamps and beds give off ultraviolet light, also called UV light 
Exposure to this kind of light can increase your risk of skin cancer 
Become familiar with your skin so that you ll notice changes 
Look for changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks 
Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs 
Wear a broad brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor 
Overview Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type , also called MEN , is a rare condition 
Genetic testing can find the changed gene that causes MEN 
Health care providers can treat the health issues that gene may cause 
This means people who have the changed gene can pass it on to their children 
Each child has a chance of getting the disorder 
This also is known as classical MEN A or Sipple syndrome 
It causes medullary thyroid cancer and noncancerous tumors of the parathyroid glands and adrenal glands 
MEN B does not cause problems with the parathyroid glands 
SymptomsSymptoms of MEN depend on the type of tumor 
They may have bumps on the tongue, lips and eyes 
They tend to be tall and thin with long arms and legs 
Following are symptoms that may be related to each tumor type 
Some people who have medullary thyroid cancer may have no symptoms 
Many people also may be the first person in their families to have this disorder 
People diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer are screened regularly for MEN 
Medullary thyroid cancer shows up as a lump on the thyroid or neck 
People with MEN also can have a condition called pheochromocytoma 
The adrenal glands are located at the top of the kidneys 
These tumors can release hormones that cause high blood pressure, sweating and other symptoms 
Children of someone who has this changed gene could inherit it and develop MEN 
Parents and siblings also could have the changed gene even if they don t have symptoms 
Being screened for parathyroid or adrenal tumors also can help 
However, genetic testing doesn t find all MEN gene changes 
Most of the time, Meniere s disease affects only one ear 
But it usually starts between the ages of to 
You have a spinning feeling that starts and stops suddenly 
It usually lasts minutes to hours, but not more than hours 
Hearing loss in Meniere s disease may come and go, especially early on 
Over time, hearing loss can be long lasting and not get better 
People with Meniere s disease often feel pressure in the ear 
After a vertigo attack, symptoms get better and might go away for a while 
Over time, how many vertigo attacks you have may lessen 
When to see a doctorSee your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of Meniere s disease 
So, it s important to find out what s causing your symptoms as soon as possible 
But it isn t clear what causes this fluid to build up in the inner ear 
Issues that affect the fluid, which might lead to Meniere s disease, include 
This may be due to a blockage or irregular ear shape 
Because no single cause has been found, Meniere s disease likely has a combination of causes 
Risk factors Meniere s disease is most common in people ages to 
You may have a higher risk of Meniere s disease if you have an autoimmune disorder 
Complications The most difficult complications of Meniere s disease can be 
Meningioma is the most common type of tumor that forms in the head 
But sometimes, their effects on nearby brain tissue, nerves or vessels may cause serious disability 
Symptoms may depend on where in the brain the meningioma is 
When to see a doctorMost symptoms of a meningioma come on slowly 
Experts know that something changes some cells in the meninges 
There s no good evidence to show that meningiomas happen because of cellphone use 
Risk factors Risk factors for a meningioma include 
Radiation therapy that involves the head may increase the risk of a meningioma 
This might mean that female hormones may play a role 
The rare condition neurofibromatosis increases the risk of meningioma and other brain tumors 
A high body mass index BMI is a risk factor for many types of cancers 
Several large studies have found that meningiomas happen more often in obese people 
But the link between obesity and meningiomas is not clear 
Complications A meningioma and its treatment can cause long term complications 
The inflammation from meningitis typically triggers symptoms such as headache, fever and a stiff neck 
Most cases of meningitis in the United States are caused by a viral infection 
Some cases of meningitis improve without treatment in a few weeks 
Symptoms may develop over several hours or over a few days 
Possible symptoms in anyone older than the age of years include 
Skin rash in some cases, such as in meningococcal meningitis 
A bulge in the soft spot on top of the baby s head 
Bacterial meningitis is serious and can cause death within days without prompt antibiotic treatment 
Delayed treatment also increases the risk of permanent brain damage 
That may include a family member or someone you live or work with 
You may need to take medicines to prevent getting an infection 
Causes Viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis 
That s followed by bacterial infections and, rarely, fungal and parasitic infections 
Because bacterial infections can lead to death, learning the cause is essential 
But bacterial meningitis also can occur when bacteria directly invade the meninges 
Several strains of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis, most commonly 
It more commonly causes pneumonia or ear or sinus infections 
This is a highly contagious infection that affects mainly teenagers and young adults 
It may cause local epidemics in college dormitories, boarding schools and military bases 
These bacteria can be found in unpasteurized cheeses, hot dogs and lunchmeats 
Infections in late pregnancy may be fatal to the baby 
Viral meningitisViral meningitis is usually mild and often clears on its own 
Symptoms are similar to acute meningitis, which is a sudden, new case 
Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease 
It affects people with weakened immune systems, such as from AIDS 
It can cause death if not treated with an antifungal medicine 
Parasitic meningitisParasites can cause a rare type of meningitis called eosinophilic meningitis 
People are usually infected by eating foods contaminated with these parasites 
Risk factors Risk factors for meningitis include 
Risk rises for anyone who hasn t completed the recommended childhood or adult vaccination schedule 
Most cases of viral meningitis occur in children younger than age years 
The infection increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery 
People without a spleen should get vaccinated to lower the risk 
With prompt treatment, even people with severe meningitis can have good recovery 
Show them how to thoroughly wash and rinse their hands 
Don t share drinks, foods, straws, eating utensils, lip balms or toothbrushes with anyone else 
Teach children and teens to avoid sharing these items too 
When you need to cough or sneeze, be sure to cover your mouth and nose 
Choose cheeses that are clearly labeled as being made with pasteurized milk 
VaccinationsSome forms of bacterial meningitis are preventable with the following vaccinations 
Older children and adults who need protection from pneumococcal bacteria may receive this vaccine 
If the first shot is given at age or older, no booster is necessary 
Torn meniscus Overview A torn meniscus is one of the most common knee injuries 
You might develop the following signs and symptoms in your knee 
Feeling as though your knee is locked in place when you try to move it 
Even kneeling, deep squatting or lifting something heavy can sometimes lead to a torn meniscus 
You might be more likely to develop osteoarthritis in the injured knee 
Overview Menopause is the time that marks the end of your menstrual cycles 
It s diagnosed after you ve gone months without a menstrual period 
There are many effective treatments available, from lifestyle adjustments to hormone therapy 
Signs and symptoms, including changes in menstruation can vary among women 
Most likely, you ll experience some irregularity in your periods before they end 
Periods also tend to happen on shorter cycles, so they are closer together 
Always seek medical advice if you have bleeding from your vagina after menopause 
Your ovaries produce hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, that regulate the menstrual cycle 
Surgery that removes your uterus but not your ovaries hysterectomy usually doesn t cause immediate menopause 
Radiation therapy only affects ovarian function if radiation is directed at the ovaries 
About of women experience menopause before age premature menopause 
But often no cause of premature menopause can be found 
Complications After menopause, your risk of certain medical conditions increases 
When your estrogen levels decline, your risk of cardiovascular disease increases 
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women as well as in men 
Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis are especially susceptible to fractures of their spine, hips and wrists 
Also, decreased sensation may reduce your desire for sexual activity libido 
Many women gain weight during the menopausal transition and after menopause because metabolism slows 
You may need to eat less and exercise more, just to maintain your current weight 
Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors 
Many people have mental health concerns from time to time 
If you have suicidal thoughtsSuicidal thoughts and behavior are common with some mental illnesses 
Suicidal thinking doesn t get better on its own so get help 
You may even be able to go along to the appointment 
Mental illness is more common in people whose blood relatives also have a mental illness 
Risk factors Certain factors may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, including 
A history of mental illness in a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling 
Stressful life situations, such as financial problems, a loved one s death or a divorce 
About in adults has a mental illness in any given year 
The effects of mental illness can be temporary or long lasting 
You also can have more than one mental health disorder at the same time 
For example, you may have depression and a substance use disorder 
Untreated mental illness can cause severe emotional, behavioral and physical health problems 
Missed work or school, or other problems related to work or school 
Weakened immune system, so your body has a hard time resisting infections 
Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your symptoms 
Mental health conditions can be harder to treat if you wait until symptoms get bad 
Long term maintenance treatment also may help prevent a relapse of symptoms 
Sufficient sleep, healthy eating and regular physical activity are important 
Sudden loss of blood flow to the small intestine is called acute mesenteric ischemia 
Mesenteric ischemia that develops over time is called chronic mesenteric ischemia 
The chronic type is usually caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries 
Chronic mesenteric ischemia is treated with open surgery or a procedure called angioplasty 
Chronic mesenteric ischemia can become acute if it s not treated 
It also can lead to severe weight loss and malnutrition 
SymptomsAcute mesenteric ischemiaSymptoms of the acute form of mesenteric ischemia include 
Chronic mesenteric ischemiaSymptoms of the chronic form of mesenteric ischemia include 
If you develop pain after eating, make an appointment with your primary care provider 
Risk factors The most common risk factors for acute mesenteric ischemia include 
Atrial fibrillation an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm 
The most common risk factors for chronic mesenteric ischemia include 
Complications If not treated promptly, acute mesenteric ischemia can lead to 
This happens because of the after meal pain associated with the condition 
This can occur as a result of the fear of eating 
The infantile form is the most common and progresses more rapidly than the other forms 
Loss of the ability to detect sensations, such as touch, pain, heat and sound 
Loss of motor skills, such as walking, moving, speaking and swallowing 
Emotional and behavioral problems, including unstable emotions and substance misuse 
Children with this form often do not survive beyond childhood 
Early signs are behavior and cognitive problems and increasing difficulty in school 
This form is less common and typically starts after age 
Causes Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an inherited disorder caused by an abnormal mutated gene 
The abnormal recessive gene is located on one of the nonsex chromosomes autosomes 
The most common cause of metachromatic leukodystrophy is a mutation in the ARSA gene 
This is caused by a mutation in the PSAP gene 
Most prostate cancers are diagnosed when the cancer is only in the prostate 
When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it s called metastatic cancer 
Treatments can slow or shrink a stage prostate cancer 
Still, treatments can lengthen life and reduce symptoms of cancer 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of stage prostate cancer may include 
The cancer cells spread to other parts of the body 
Prostate cancer starts when cells in the prostate develop changes in their DNA 
The changes tell the cancer cells to replicate much more quickly 
The cancer cells form a mass called a tumor in the prostate 
These tumors can grow to invade and destroy nearby healthy tissue 
Prostate cancer cells that spread past the prostate most often go to the 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of stage prostate cancer include 
These inherited DNA changes also increase the risk of more aggressive forms of prostate cancer 
Black people also are more likely to have prostate cancer that is aggressive or advanced 
You might develop it if you participate in activities that involve running and jumping 
Fortunately, at home treatments, such as ice and rest, often relieve symptoms 
Sharp or shooting pain, numbness, or tingling in your toes 
When to see a doctorNot all foot problems need medical care 
Sometimes your feet ache after a long day of standing or a punishing workout 
But it s best not to ignore foot pain that lasts more than a few days 
A high arch can put extra pressure on the metatarsals 
Wearing too small shoes or high heels can cause your foot to be misshapen 
It causes symptoms that are similar to metatarsalgia and can also contribute to metatarsal stress 
Risk factors Almost anyone can develop metatarsalgia, but you re at higher risk if you 
Wear high heels, shoes that don t fit properly or shoes with spikes, such as cleats 
Have other foot problems, including hammertoe and calluses on the bottom of your feet 
When it occurs in these settings, it s known as health care associated HA MRSA 
Another type of infection has occurred in the wider community among healthy people 
This form, community associated CA MRSA , often begins as a painful skin boil 
These red bumps can quickly turn into deep, painful boils abscesses that require surgical draining 
If wounds appear infected or are accompanied by a fever, see your doctor 
Causes Different varieties of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, commonly called staph, exist 
Carriers of have the ability to spread it, even if they re not sick themselves 
Participating in contact sports can spread easily through cuts and scrapes and skin to skin contact 
outbreaks have occurred in military training camps, child care centers and jails 
Men who have sex with men have a higher risk of developing infections 
People with HIV have a higher risk of developing infections 
People who use illicit injected drugs have a higher risk of infections 
This can allow the infections to spread and sometimes become life threatening 
Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with clean, dry bandages until they heal 
This happens when the communication between nerves and muscles breaks down 
SymptomsMuscle weakness caused by myasthenia gravis gets worse when the affected muscle is used 
Because symptoms usually get better with rest, muscle weakness can come and go 
They usually reach their worst within a few years after the disease begins 
Myasthenia gravis may affect any of the muscles that you can control 
Your speech might sound soft or nasal, depending on which muscles are affected 
You might choke easily, making it difficult to eat, drink or take pills 
Sometimes, liquids you re trying to swallow come out your nose 
The muscles used for chewing might tire halfway through a meal 
This is especially true if you ve been eating something hard to chew, such as steak 
Neck and limb musclesMyasthenia gravis also can cause weakness in the neck, arms and legs 
Weak neck muscles make it hard to hold up the head 
When to see a doctorTalk to your health care provider if you have problems 
With fewer receptor sites available, your muscles receive fewer nerve signals 
Some people have myasthenia gravis that isn t caused by antibodies blocking acetylcholine, MuSK or LRP 
Thymus glandThe thymus gland is a part of your immune system 
This gland is located in the upper chest beneath the breastbone 
Researchers believe that the thymus gland makes or helps produce the antibodies that block acetylcholine 
The thymus gland is large in babies and small in healthy adults 
In some adults with myasthenia gravis, however, the thymus gland is larger than usual 
Some people with myasthenia gravis also have tumors of the thymus gland, called thymomas 
Other causesRarely, mothers with myasthenia gravis have children who are born with myasthenia gravis 
If treated immediately, children usually recover within two months after birth 
Complications Complications of myasthenia gravis are treatable, but some can be life threatening 
It happens when the muscles that control breathing become too weak to work 
Medicines and therapies that filter the blood help people to breathe on their own 
Thymus gland tumorsSome people with myasthenia gravis have a tumor in the thymus gland 
The thymus is a gland under the breastbone that is part of the immune system 
Other disordersPeople with myasthenia gravis are more likely to have the following conditions 
The thyroid gland in the neck secretes hormones that regulate the metabolism 
An overactive thyroid can cause problems dealing with heat, weight loss and other issues 
This protein is made in the soft, blood producing tissue in the center of bones 
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance occurs most often in older men 
People who have high amounts of this protein in the blood need regular checkups 
That s so they can get earlier treatment if the condition gets worse 
Some people have a rash or nerve problems, such as numbness or tingling 
A blood test for another condition might find MGUS by chance 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing MGUS include 
Africans and Black Americans are more likely to get MGUS than white people are 
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors 
A child with more severe microcephaly may also have a sloping forehead 
Treating craniosynostosis usually means an infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones 
This surgery relieves pressure on the brain, giving it enough space to grow and develop 
Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to a baby s brain 
These include toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, German measles rubella , chickenpox varicella and Zika virus 
Exposure to drugs, alcohol or certain toxic chemicals in the womb 
Any of these may affect fetal brain development during pregnancy 
Not getting enough nutrients during pregnancy may hurt fetal brain development 
Uncontrolled phenylketonuria fen ul kee toe NU ree uh , also known as PKU, in the mother 
But depending on the cause and severity of the microcephaly, complications may include 
PreventionLearning your child has microcephaly can raise questions about future pregnancies 
Work with your health care provider to determine the cause of the microcephaly 
Migraine with aura Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Sometimes migraine aura occurs without headache, especially in people age and older 
Blind spots scotomas , which are sometimes outlined by simple geometric designs 
Zigzag lines that gradually float across your field of vision 
Other disturbancesOther temporary disturbances sometimes associated with migraine aura include 
Your doctor will need to rule out more serious conditions, such as a stroke 
Migraines are also more common in women than in men 
Complications People who have migraine with aura are at a mildly increased risk of stroke 
People with MCI may be aware that their memory or mental function has slipped 
But these changes aren t bad enough to impact daily life or affect usual activities 
MCI may increase the risk of dementia caused by Alzheimer s disease or other brain disorders 
But some people with mild cognitive impairment might never get worse 
SymptomsThe brain, like the rest of the body, changes with age 
Many people notice they become more forgetful as they age 
It may take longer to think of a word or to recall a person s name 
MCI may be the cause of changes in thinking if 
Or you can t follow the plot of a book or movie 
You find it hard to make decisions, finish a task or follow instructions 
You start to have trouble finding your way around places you know well 
This may include trouble recalling recent events or having trouble thinking clearly 
Or MCI may progress to Alzheimer s disease dementia or another type of dementia 
Some of these changes have been seen in autopsy studies of people with MCI 
Small strokes or reduced blood flow through brain blood vessels 
Brain imaging studies show that the following changes may be associated with MCI 
Decreased size of the hippocampus, a brain region important for memory 
Increased size of the brain s fluid filled spaces, known as ventricles 
Glucose is the sugar that s the main source of energy for cells 
Risk factors The strongest risk factors for MCI are 
Having a form of a gene known as APOE e 
But having the gene doesn t guarantee that you ll have a decline in thinking and memory 
Overall, about to of older adults develop dementia every year 
But research has found some lifestyle factors may lower the risk of getting MCI 
Manage health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and depression 
Include fruits and vegetables and foods low in saturated fats 
Exercise at a moderate to vigorous intensity most days of the week 
Overview Miscarriage is the sudden loss of a pregnancy before the th week 
About to of known pregnancies end in miscarriage 
This is because many miscarriages happen early on, before people realize they re pregnant 
Many miscarriages happen because the unborn baby does not develop properly 
Miscarriage is a somewhat common experience but that doesn t make it any easier 
If you ve lost a pregnancy, take a step toward emotional healing by learning more 
Bleeding from the vagina with or without pain, including light bleeding called spotting 
Pain or cramping in the pelvic area or lower back 
If you have passed tissue from your vagina, place it in a clean container 
Then, bring it to your health care professional s office or the hospital 
A lab can examine the tissue to check for signs of a miscarriage 
Causes Irregular genes or chromosomesMost miscarriages happen because the unborn baby doesn t develop properly 
Or the embryo forms but is absorbed back into the body 
This most often happens if both sets of chromosomes come from the sperm 
With a partial molar pregnancy, a fetus may develop, but it can t survive 
Molar and partial molar pregnancies can t continue because they can cause serious health problems 
Maternal health conditionsIn a few cases, having certain health conditions might lead to miscarriage 
What does NOT cause miscarriageRoutine activities such as these don t cause a miscarriage 
And stay away from activities that could lead to injury, such as contact sports 
Working, as long as you re not exposed to high doses of harmful chemicals or radiation 
Talk with your health care professional if you re concerned about work related risks 
Risk factors Various factors raise the risk of miscarriage, including 
At age , the risk is about to 
And at age , it ranges from to 
People who smoke have a greater risk of miscarriage than do nonsmokers 
Heavy use of caffeine or alcohol use also raises the risk 
Being underweight or being overweight has been linked with a higher risk of miscarriage 
Fever higher than degrees Fahrenheit more than two times 
The illness can get worse fast and become life threatening without treatment 
Heavy bleeding from the vagina, called a hemorrhage, is another miscarriage complication 
Along with the bleeding, a hemorrhage often happens with symptoms such as 
Tiredness or weakness due low red blood cells, also called anemia 
Some people who have a hemorrhage need blood from a donor or surgery 
PreventionOften, there s nothing you can do to prevent a miscarriage 
Instead, focus on taking good care of yourself and your unborn baby 
Get regular prenatal care while you re pregnant and right after you give birth 
Many experts recommend having no more than milligrams per day while pregnant 
This is the amount of caffeine in a ounce cup of brewed coffee 
The upper left heart chamber is called the left atrium 
The bottom left heart chamber is called the left ventricle 
The mitral valve flaps, also called leaflets, may not close tightly 
The flaps of the mitral valve become thick or stiff, and they can fuse together 
Sometimes, surgery is recommended to repair or replace the mitral valve 
Each valve has flaps, called leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat 
The heart now must work harder to force blood through the smaller valve opening 
Some forms of mitral valve disease can be present at birth 
A heart problem that you re born with is called a congenital heart defect 
For example, mitral valve stenosis is often caused by rheumatic fever 
This fever is a complication of a strep infection that can affect the heart 
Risk factors Several things can increase the risk of mitral valve disease, including 
Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect 
High blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension 
Overview Mitral valve regurgitation is the most common type of heart valve disease 
In this condition, the valve between the left heart chambers doesn t close fully 
Mitral valve regurgitation can make you feel very tired or short of breath 
Treatment of mitral valve regurgitation may include regular health checkups, medicines or surgery 
You may not need treatment if the condition is mild 
Without proper treatment, severe mitral valve regurgitation can cause heart rhythm problems or heart failure 
Fatigue is a common but nonspecific symptom of mitral valve regurgitation 
Feelings of a rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations 
Each valve has flaps, also called leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat 
In mitral valve regurgitation, the valve flaps don t close tightly 
This makes it harder for the heart to work properly 
If rheumatic fever causes mitral valve disease, the condition is called rheumatic mitral valve disease 
A leaky mitral valve caused by a heart attack is called ischemic mitral regurgitation 
Heart problem present at birth, also called a congenital heart defect 
Some people are born with heart structure problems, including damaged heart valves 
The condition can affect how the mitral valve works, causing regurgitation 
Types of cardiomyopathy linked to mitral valve regurgitation include dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
This is especially likely in people with mitral valve prolapse 
A tear can cause blood to suddenly leak through the mitral valve 
A chest injury also can cause rupture of the cords 
Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart s chambers and valves, called endocarditis 
Germs get into the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart 
Risk factors Several things can increase the risk of mitral valve regurgitation, including 
History of other heart valve diseases, including mitral valve prolapse and mitral valve stenosis 
Complications Mitral valve regurgitation complications often depend on the severity of disease 
Mild mitral valve regurgitation usually does not cause any problems 
The strain on the heart can cause the left lower chamber to widen 
Mitral valve regurgitation may trigger this common heart rhythm disorder 
Atrial fibrillation has been linked to an increased risk of blood clots and stroke 
The extra effort causes the left lower heart chamber to get bigger 
The narrowed valve reduces or blocks blood flow into the heart s main pumping chamber 
Mitral valve stenosis can make you tired and short of breath 
Other symptoms may include irregular heartbeats, dizziness, chest pain or coughing up blood 
Mitral valve stenosis can be caused by a complication of strep throat called rheumatic fever 
Treatment for mitral valve stenosis may include medication or mitral valve repair or replacement surgery 
Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and whether it s getting worse 
Untreated, mitral valve stenosis can lead to serious heart complications 
You may not have any symptoms, or you may have mild ones for many years 
Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis can occur at any age even during childhood 
Shortness of breath, especially with activity or when you lie down 
Anything that puts stress on the body, including pregnancy or infections, may trigger symptoms 
Your provider might recommend that you visit a doctor trained in heart diseases 
Blood flow between the upper left and lower left heart chambers may decrease 
This complication of strep throat is the most common cause of mitral valve stenosis 
When rheumatic fever damages the mitral valve, the condition is called rheumatic mitral valve disease 
The valve disease symptoms may not be seen until years to decades after rheumatic fever 
As you age, calcium deposits can build up around the mitral valve 
This can cause narrowing of the structures that support the mitral valve flaps 
The condition is called mitral annular calcification, or MAC for short 
Radiation to the chest area can sometimes cause the mitral valve to thicken and harden 
The heart valve damage typically occurs to years after radiation therapy 
Rarely, some babies are born with a narrowed mitral valve that causes problems over time 
Lupus and other autoimmune conditions may rarely cause mitral valve stenosis 
Risk factors Risk factors for mitral valve stenosis include 
Older adults are at increased risk of calcium buildup around the mitral valve 
Radiation causes changes in the mitral valve shape and structure 
Some migraine drugs contain a class of medicine called ergot alkaloids 
Ergot alkaloids may rarely cause heart valve scarring that leads to mitral stenosis 
Complications Untreated, mitral valve stenosis can lead to complications such as 
Mitral valve stenosis may cause an irregular and chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation 
If a blood clot from the heart travels to the brain, a stroke can occur 
It can occur if a narrowed mitral valve slows or blocks blood flow 
The heart must work harder to pump blood to the right sided heart chambers 
PreventionRheumatic fever is the most common cause of mitral valve stenosis 
So the best way to prevent mitral valve stenosis is to prevent rheumatic fever 
Overview Mittelschmerz is one sided, lower abdominal pain associated with ovulation 
For minor mittelschmerz discomfort, over the counter pain relievers and home remedies are often effective 
Mittelschmerz pain occurs on the side of the ovary that s releasing an egg ovulating 
If it occurs midcycle and goes away without treatment, it s most likely mittelschmerz 
Causes Mittelschmerz occurs during ovulation, when the follicle ruptures and releases its egg 
Some women have mittelschmerz every month others have it only occasionally 
The exact cause of mittelschmerz is unknown, but possible reasons for the pain include these 
Pain at any other point in your menstrual cycle isn t mittelschmerz 
But it may be more likely to happen between the ages of and 
Complications Mittelschmerz doesn t lead to other health conditions, also called complications 
The pain goes away on its own, or with medicine or home remedies 
It s linked with natural changes in the body that happen during the menstrual cycle 
Mixed connective tissue disease Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Many people with this uncommon disease also have Sjogren s syndrome 
For this reason, mixed connective tissue disease MCTD is sometimes called an overlap disease 
Instead, they tend to occur over a number of years, which can complicate diagnosis 
Treatment depends on how severe the disease is and the organs involved 
Joints can become inflamed, swollen and deformed, similar to what occurs with rheumatoid arthritis 
Red or reddish brown patches can appear over the knuckles 
Causes Mixed connective tissue disease is an autoimmune disorder, although the cause isn t known 
Some people with mixed connective tissue disease have a family history of the condition 
But the role of genetics in the disease remains unclear 
Risk factors Mixed connective tissue disease can occur in people of any age 
However, it appears to be most common in women under the age of 
This condition is a major cause of death in people with mixed connective tissue disease 
Parts of the heart can enlarge, or inflammation can occur around the heart 
You might have abdominal pain and problems with swallowing and digesting food 
About of people with mixed connective tissue disease have iron deficiency anemia 
People with severe Raynaud s disease can develop gangrene in the fingers 
These symptoms can be sometimes confused with other diseases such as multiple sclerosis 
Optic neuritis in children may be mistaken for a headache 
It also may cause sensory loss and changes in bowel, bladder or sexual function 
Disease courseSome people who have MOGAD only experience one attack of symptoms 
This is called monophasic MOGAD and is slightly more common 
Attacks usually develop over days and can be severe and debilitating 
It s an autoimmune disorder in which the body s immune system attacks its own tissues 
In people with MOGAD, the immune system destroys the fatty substance called myelin 
Myelin coats and protects nerve fibers in the optic nerve, brain and spinal cord 
This means those parts of the body won t work properly 
MOGAD is often misdiagnosed as another disease that attacks myelin and causes similar symptoms 
It may be mistaken for multiple sclerosis, known as MS 
MOGAD also is diagnosed differently, using results from MRI and blood tests 
Risk factors These factors may increase your risk of developing MOGAD 
Children and young adults are slightly more likely to develop MOGAD 
MOGAD may develop after an infectious illness or vaccination, such as SARS CoV 
The first attack is usually the worst, but each attack can cause more damage 
Overview A molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy 
These cells typically become the organ that feeds a growing fetus 
There are two types of molar pregnancy complete molar pregnancy and partial molar pregnancy 
In a complete molar pregnancy, the placental tissue swells and appears to form fluid filled cysts 
In a partial molar pregnancy, the placenta might have both regular and irregular tissue 
There may be a fetus, but the fetus can t survive 
A molar pregnancy can have serious complications, including a rare form of cancer 
SymptomsA molar pregnancy may seem like a regular pregnancy at first 
Dark brown to bright red bleeding from the vagina during the first three months 
A uterus growing quickly and being too large early in the pregnancy 
In a complete molar pregnancy, one or two sperm fertilize an egg 
The chromosomes from the mother s egg are missing or don t work 
Risk factors Factors that can contribute to a molar pregnancy include 
If you ve had one molar pregnancy, you re more likely to have another 
A repeat molar pregnancy happens, on average, in out of every people 
Complications After removing a molar pregnancy, molar tissue might remain and continue to grow 
GTN happens more often in complete molar pregnancies than it does in partial molar pregnancies 
Another treatment possibility is removal of the uterus, also known as hysterectomy 
Rarely, a cancerous form of GTN known as choriocarcinoma develops and spreads to other organs 
You might want to wait six months to one year 
Overview Moles, also known as nevi, are a common type of skin growth 
Most people have to moles that appear during childhood and the teenage years 
Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink 
This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for 
Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color 
Look for new growth in a mole larger than inch about mm 
Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height 
Also, new symptoms can arise, such as itchiness or bleeding 
Cancerous moles, also known as malignant moles, vary greatly in how they look 
Causes Moles are caused when cells in the skin called melanocytes grow in clusters 
They produce melanin, the natural pigment that gives skin its color 
Some people have an above average risk of their moles becoming cancerous and leading to melanoma 
Having more than moles suggests a greater risk of melanoma and possibly breast cancer 
If you ve had melanoma before, there is a higher risk of getting melanoma again 
Also, some types of atypical nevi lead to a genetic form of melanoma 
Tanning lamps and beds release UV rays and can raise your risk of skin cancer 
Watch for changesBecome familiar with the location and pattern of your moles 
Regularly look at your skin for changes that may signal melanoma 
With the help of mirrors, do a head to toe check, including 
UV radiation has been linked to a higher melanoma risk 
And children who haven t been protected from sun exposure tend to grow more moles 
Apply sunscreen to dry skin about minutes before going outdoors, even on cloudy days 
Use a broad spectrum, water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 
Sunglasses, broad brimmed hats, long sleeves and other clothing can protect you from damaging UV rays 
Tanning lamps and beds release UV rays that can raise your risk of skin cancer 
If the bumps are scratched or injured, the infection can spread to nearby skin 
Molluscum contagiosum also spreads through person to person contact and contact with infected objects 
Left untreated, the bumps usually disappear in months to years 
Small bumps typically under about inch smaller than millimeters in diameter 
Bumps with a small dent or dot at the top near the center 
Bumps on the face, trunk, arms or legs of children 
Causes The virus that causes molluscum contagiosum spreads easily through 
Contact with infected objects, such as towels, kickboards and wrestling mats 
Swimming in pools or hot tubs contaminated with the virus 
Scratching or rubbing the bumps, which spreads the virus to nearby skin 
Risk factors Risk factors for molluscum contagiosum include 
Complications The bumps and the skin around them may become inflamed 
This is thought to be an immune system response to the infection 
If scratched, these bumps can become infected and heal with scarring 
If sores appear on the eyelids, pink eye conjunctivitis can develop 
Keeping your hands clean can help prevent spreading the virus 
Shaving over the infected areas also can spread the virus 
Cover the bumps with clothing when around others, to prevent direct contact 
Overview Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, affect people emotionally 
If you have bipolar disorder, you ll likely have extreme mood swings 
Having a mood disorder may raise your risk of suicide 
If you re thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for help 
You could have less energy, trouble sleeping, trouble concentrating, changes in appetite and lack interest 
You also could have feelings of worthlessness or guilt and be in pain and tired 
Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder a diagnosis used for children and teenagers 
Bipolar II disorder features constantly elevated moods called hypomanias 
that last at least four days and less than one week 
But other people should be able to notice that something is different about you 
Disrupted sleep, usually a decreased need for sleep, but a continued high energy level 
If this is the case, seek emergency treatment at once 
Your mood disorder is not likely to go away on its own 
Environmental factors can include, for example, childhood experiences and stressful life events 
These are conditions that affect the brain and the nervous system 
Despite its name, morning sickness can strike at any time of the day or night 
Many people have morning sickness, especially during the first three months of pregnancy 
Rarely, morning sickness is so bad that it turns into hyperemesis gravidarum 
Hyperemesis gravidarum might require going to a hospital for treatment 
Morning sickness is often brought on by smelling certain odors or eating certain foods 
Morning sickness is most common during the first three months of pregnancy 
Symptoms usually improve by the middle or end of the second three months of pregnancy 
When to see a doctorContact your health care provider if 
You produce no urine or only a little urine that s a dark color 
Complications Mild nausea and vomiting of pregnancy usually won t cause harm 
Severe nausea and vomiting may result in less urine output 
However, taking a daily vitamin supplement before and during pregnancy might help 
This can cause a sharp, burning pain in the ball of your foot 
You may have stinging, burning or numbness in the affected toes 
High heeled or tight shoes have been linked to the development of Morton s neuroma 
Many people experience relief by switching to lower heeled shoes with wider toe boxes 
SymptomsTypically, there s no outward sign of this condition, such as a lump 
A feeling as if you re standing on a pebble in your shoe 
A burning pain in the ball of your foot that may radiate into your toes 
Risk factors Factors that appear to contribute to Morton s neuroma include 
The bumps usually go away without treatment in a few days 
Some mosquito bites may get very swollen, sore and inflamed 
This type of reaction, sometimes called skeeter syndrome, is most common in children 
Mosquito bites can cause severe illnesses if the insects carry certain viruses or parasites 
SymptomsMosquito bites often happen on parts of the body that aren t covered by clothing 
An itchy, inflamed bump that forms a few minutes after a bite 
Children are more likely to have a severe reaction than are adults 
These might include a high fever, severe headache, body aches and signs of infection 
Causes Mosquito bites are caused by female mosquitoes feeding on your blood 
As a biting mosquito fills itself with blood, it injects saliva into your skin 
The saliva triggers an immune system reaction that results in the classic itching and bump 
Mosquitoes are attracted to smells, such as from sweat, floral scents and exhaled carbon dioxide 
The mosquito gets a virus or parasite by biting an infected person or animal 
West Nile, dengue fever and some types of encephalitis occur in the United States 
PreventionMosquitos bite during both day and night, and they can live indoors 
You can take several steps to protect yourself from mosquito bites 
Repairing any tears in the screens on windows, doors and camping gear 
The most effective insect repellents in the United States include one of these active ingredients 
Whichever product you choose, read the label before you apply it 
If you re using a spray repellent, apply it outdoors and away from food 
Don t use DEET containing products on infants younger than months 
Treat clothing and outdoor gearPermethrin is an insecticide and insect repellent used for added protection 
This product is made to use on clothing and outdoor gear, not skin 
Don t wash bed nets or set them in sunlight, as this breaks down permethrin 
Clothing sprayed with permethrin can offer protection for two washings and up to two weeks 
Use protective clothing and gearWeather permitting, wear a hat, long sleeved shirts and long pants 
Take preventive medicineGet vaccinations or take preventive medicine that your health care provider has suggested 
Reduce mosquitoes around your homeGet rid of standing water, which mosquitoes need to breed 
Take these steps to keep your house and yard free of mosquito pools 
Empty children s wading pools at least once a week, and preferably more often 
This movement disorder affects the part of the brain that controls coordinated movement 
Ataxia may cause uncoordinated or clumsy balance, speech or limb movements, and other symptoms 
There are many causes of ataxia, including genetic and degenerative disorders 
Ataxia may also be caused by an infection or another treatable condition 
Chorea is characterized by repetitive, brief, irregular, somewhat rapid, involuntary movements 
The movements typically involve the face, mouth, trunk and limbs 
This condition involves sustained involuntary muscle contractions with twisting, repetitive movements 
Dystonia may affect the entire body or one part of the body 
Functional movement disorder isn t due to neurological disease and is treatable 
This is an inherited, progressive disease that can be confirmed with genetic testing 
Huntington s disease has three components uncontrolled movements, cognitive problems and psychiatric conditions 
This uncommon neurological disorder affects many brain systems and progressively worsens 
Multiple system atrophy causes a movement disorder, such as ataxia or parkinsonism 
It can also cause low blood pressure, impaired bladder function and acting out dreams 
This slowly progressive disease causes tremor, muscle stiffness, slow or decreased movement, or imbalance 
Parkinson s disease and certain dopamine blocking medications are the most common causes 
Other causes include degenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy 
This is a rare neurological disorder that causes problems with walking, balance and eye movements 
It sometimes may resemble Parkinson s disease but is a distinct condition 
Tardive dyskinesia causes repetitive and involuntary movements such as grimacing, eye blinking and other movements 
The carotid artery is a major artery that brings blood to the brain 
When it s blocked, blood flow to the brain is reduced 
The condition may cause a ministroke, known as a transient ischemic attack, or a stroke 
But it s more common in East Asian countries, especially Korea, Japan and China 
This may be due to certain genetic factors in those populations 
Spotting symptoms early is very important to prevent complications such as a stroke 
In children, the first symptom is usually a stroke or recurrent transient ischemic attack TIA 
But adults also may experience bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke 
The bleeding occurs because of the way blood vessels in the brain formed 
Symptoms of moyamoya disease related to reduced blood flow to the brain include 
Weakness, numbness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg 
These symptoms can be triggered by exercise, crying, coughing, straining or a fever 
If you observe any of these signs, call or emergency medical help immediately 
See your health care provider if you have any of the symptoms of moyamoya disease 
Early detection and treatment can help prevent a stroke and serious complications 
Moyamoya disease is most commonly seen in Japan, Korea and China 
But it also occurs in other parts of the world 
This same higher prevalence has been documented among Asians living in Western countries 
Complications Most complications from moyamoya disease are associated with the effects of strokes 
Other complications include speech problems, movement disorders and developmental delays 
Moyamoya disease can cause serious and permanent damage to the brain 
Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage or deterioration of the nerve fibers 
Electric shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward Lhermitte sign 
Disease courseMost people with MS have a relapsing remitting disease course 
Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen signs and symptoms of MS 
The worsening of symptoms usually includes problems with mobility and gait 
The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary progressive MS 
Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires 
It isn t clear why MS develops in some people and not others 
A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible 
Risk factors These factors may increase your risk of developing multiple sclerosis 
White people, particularly those of Northern European descent, are at highest risk of developing MS 
People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk 
A gene on chromosome p has been found to be associated with multiple sclerosis 
An association with obesity and multiple sclerosis has been found in females 
This is especially true for female childhood and adolescent obesity 
MSA was formerly called Shy Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy or striatonigral degeneration 
Treatment includes medications and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms, but there is no cure 
SymptomsMultiple system atrophy MSA affects many parts of your body 
Symptoms usually start in adulthood, usually in the s or s 
The type depends on the symptoms you have when you re diagnosed 
The signs and symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson s disease, such as 
Tremors can occur at rest or when moving your arms or legs 
Impaired movement and coordination, such as unsteady gait and loss of balance 
Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision and difficulty focusing your eyes 
You can also develop dangerously high blood pressure levels while lying down supine hypertension 
Impaired body temperature control, often causing cold hands or feet 
Abnormal breathing at night or a harsh breathing sound stridor 
Color changes in hands and feet caused by pooling of blood 
Causes There s no known cause for multiple system atrophy MSA 
Complications The progression of MSA varies, but the condition does not go into remission 
Progressive immobility that can lead to secondary problems such as a breakdown of your skin 
Loss of ability to care for yourself in day to day activities 
People typically live about to years after multiple system atrophy symptoms first appear 
The excess hormones can cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms 
But regular testing can detect problems, and doctors can provide treatment as needed 
Symptoms are caused by the release of too many hormones in the body 
Causes MEN is caused by a change in the MEN gene 
That gene controls how the body makes a protein called menin 
Menin helps to keep cells in the body from growing and dividing too quickly 
People who have one of those genetic changes can pass it on to their children 
Many people with a change in the MEN gene inherit it from a parent 
That s true even if they have not yet developed symptoms of MEN 
Mumps Overview Mumps is an illness caused by a virus 
It usually affects the glands on each side of the face 
Mumps are not common in the United States because of vaccines 
People who are not vaccinated are at high risk of infection 
Vaccinated people who get mumps usually have milder symptoms and fewer complications 
SymptomsSymptoms of mumps show up about to weeks after exposure to the virus 
Some people may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms 
The first symptoms may be similar to flu symptoms such as 
Swelling of the salivary glands usually starts within a few days 
Swelling of one or both glands on the sides of the face 
Less often, swelling of glands below the floor of the mouth 
Mumps spreads very easily for about five days after the swelling starts 
If you think you have mumps, let the clinic know before you go 
The clinic staff likely will take steps to prevent the spread of disease 
Other conditions may have similar symptoms, so it s important to get a quick diagnosis 
If you think your child has mumps, call your care provider if your child develops 
Use a cold or warm cloth over swollen salivary glands 
Causes Mumps is caused by a type of germ called a virus 
Coughing or sneezing can release tiny droplets with the virus into the air 
You can get the virus by breathing in tiny droplets 
Complications Complications of mumps are more likely among people who aren t vaccinated 
They can happen even if a person didn t have swollen salivary glands 
Complications happen when the virus reaches other tissues in the body 
This complication, also caused oophoritis, causes pain, upset stomach, vomiting and fever 
Encephalitis is swelling, called inflammation, in the brain that may damage tissues 
This complication can cause changes in consciousness, seizures and loss of muscle control 
Meningitis is swelling, or inflammation, of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord 
Mumps can cause damage to the pancreas, called pancreatitis, from swelling 
Symptoms may include pain or tenderness near the stomach, upset stomach, vomiting and fever 
People who aren t vaccinated are more likely to get mumps 
For some people, vaccine protection may go down over time 
When fully vaccinated people get mumps, they usually have milder symptoms and fewer complications 
The MMR vaccineThe mumps vaccine is a part of the recommended childhood vaccinations 
The first dose between the ages of and months 
The second dose between the ages of and years before entering school 
The original study that suggested this connection in was based on scientific errors 
You may need two doses of the vaccine or a booster 
This is especially important if you are in a high risk setting or in an outbreak 
The following people may need proof of vaccination or more doses 
People who were born before were likely exposed to the virus 
The mumps vaccine is made from a weak but still infectious mumps virus 
A typical immune system can handle this weak virus easily 
But there are some exceptions if the benefits outweigh the risks 
Also, this type of vaccine is not suggested for people who are pregnant 
Side effects of the MMR vaccineThe MMR vaccine is safe and effective 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include 
When to see the doctorMild strains can be treated at home 
Certain parts of the body are more susceptible to strains during participation in certain sports 
Elbow strains are often caused by throwing sports and racquet sports 
If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries 
Common measures include blood transfusions and medications to boost blood cell production 
SymptomsPeople with myelodysplastic syndromes might not experience signs and symptoms at first 
Unusual paleness pallor , which occurs due to a low red blood cell count anemia 
Pinpoint sized red spots just beneath the skin that are caused by bleeding petechiae 
Frequent infections, which occur due to a low white blood cell count leukopenia 
Myelodysplastic syndromes occur when something disrupts this process so that the blood cells don t mature 
In this subtype, two or three blood cell types are abnormal 
This subtype involves a low number of one or more blood cell types 
Very immature blood cells blasts are found in the blood and bone marrow 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of myelodysplastic syndromes include 
Reduced numbers of red blood cells can cause anemia, which can make you feel tired 
Having too few white blood cells increases your risk of serious infections 
Lacking platelets in your blood to stop bleeding can lead to excessive bleeding 
The inflammation can reduce the heart s ability to pump blood 
Myocarditis can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid or irregular heart rhythms arrhythmias 
Sometimes a drug reaction or general inflammatory condition causes myocarditis 
Clots can form in the heart, leading to a stroke or heart attack 
Flu like symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pain, fever or sore throat 
If you are having unexplained chest pain and shortness of breath, seek emergency medical help 
When to see a doctorContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of myocarditis 
Gastrointestinal infections echoviruses , mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus and German measles rubella also can cause myocarditis 
Myocarditis can also be caused by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS 
Some parasites are transmitted by insects and can cause a condition called Chagas disease 
A fungal infection may cause myocarditis, particularly in people with weakened immune systems 
Exposure to carbon monoxide and radiation can sometimes cause heart muscle inflammation 
Conditions that may cause myocarditis include lupus, Wegener s granulomatosis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu s arteritis 
Untreated, myocarditis can damage the heart muscle so that it can t pump blood well 
A heart attack can occur if a clot blocks one of the heart coronary arteries 
Damage to the heart muscle can change how the heart beats 
Certain serious arrhythmias can cause the heart to stop beating sudden cardiac arrest 
Frequent hand washing is one of the best ways to avoid getting sick and spreading illness 
Overview Myoclonus refers to a quick jerking movement that you can t control 
These forms of myoclonus occur in healthy people and usually aren t serious 
Sometimes the cause of myoclonus is unknown or can t be specifically treated 
SymptomsPeople with myoclonus often describe their symptoms as jerks, shakes or spasms that are 
Occurring in one part of the body or all over the body 
Sometimes severe enough to interfere with eating, speaking or walking 
Causes Myoclonus may be caused by a variety of underlying problems 
It is commonly separated into different types based on what is causing it 
Physiological myoclonusThis type of myoclonus occurs in healthy people and rarely needs treatment 
In some cases, the cause is hereditary, meaning passed down in families 
Epileptic myoclonusThis type of myoclonus occurs as part of an epileptic disorder 
Sometimes, the pain is felt in other parts of the body 
The pain often is felt as shoulder pain, back pain, tension headaches and face pain 
This syndrome can happen after a muscle has been tensed over and over 
Repeated motions used in jobs or hobbies can be the cause 
So can stress related muscle tension, poor posture and weak muscles 
In some cases, the cause of myofascial pain is unknown 
But the pain of myofascial pain syndrome doesn t go away 
Treatment options include exercise, massage, physical therapy and shots in the trigger points 
Pain medicines and finding ways to relax also can help 
When to see a doctorMost people have muscle pain at times 
Causes The exact cause of myofascial pain syndrome is not known 
Areas of tight muscle fibers, called trigger points, form in muscles 
Factors that may increase the risk of muscle trigger points include 
A muscle injury or ongoing muscle stress may lead to the forming of trigger points 
For instance, a spot in or near a strained muscle may become a trigger point 
Repeat motions and poor posture also can increase the risk 
One theory is that these people may be more likely to clench their muscles 
Clenching is a form of repeated strain that leaves muscles open to trigger points 
Complications Complications linked to myofascial pain syndrome include 
Symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome may make it hard to sleep 
It might be hard to find a good sleep position 
And if you move while sleeping, you might hit a trigger point and awaken 
Some research suggests that myofascial pain syndrome may lead to fibromyalgia in some people 
Some experts believe myofascial pain syndrome might help start this process 
You can compensate for the blurry vision with eyeglasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery 
The need to squint or partially close the eyelids to see clearly 
Children may have difficulty seeing things on white boards or screen projections in the classroom 
Adults with myopia may notice difficulty reading street signs or signs in a store 
Seek emergency medical care if you experience any of the following 
A curtain like gray shadow covering all or part of your field of vision 
A shadow in your outer or side vision peripheral vision 
These are warnings signs of the retina becoming detached from the back of the eye 
Significant nearsightedness is associated with an increased risk of retinal detachment 
A screening test may be performed by a pediatrician, ophthalmologist, optometrist or other trained provider 
Vision screenings are often offered at schools or community centers 
Every to years from ages to 
Every to years from ages to 
In order for you to see, light has to pass through the cornea and lens 
Nearsightedness usually results from the eye being too long or oval shaped rather than round 
It may also result from the curve of the cornea being too steep 
The messages sent from the retina to the brain are perceived as blurry 
Some people may perceive distant objects as somewhat clear, but near objects appear blurry 
For some people with farsightedness, objects are blurry at all distances 
If one of your parents is nearsighted, your risk of developing the condition is increased 
Prolonged reading or other close up activities are associated with an increased risk of nearsightedness 
Complications Nearsightedness is associated with a variety of complications from mild to severe, such as 
MyxofibrosarcomaMyxofibrosarcoma MFS is a type of cancer that begins in the connective tissue 
MFS starts as a growth of cells that can grow into healthy body tissue 
MFS might cause a lump under the skin that grows slowly 
Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and health 
The provider will check your body for signs of cancer 
Imaging tests can help your provider see the cancer s size 
A biopsy procedure involves taking some of the suspicious tissue for testing in a lab 
Lab tests can show if you have cancer and what type 
To get the tissue sample, sometimes your provider uses a needle to collect the cells 
This makes it more likely that the cancer won t come back 
Which treatment is best for you will depend on your cancer 
Your care team considers the size and location of your cancer 
A cancer that grows quickly has different treatment options than a cancer that grows slowly 
SurgeryThe goal of surgery is to cut out as much of the cancer as possible 
If all the MFS is removed, surgery might be the only treatment needed 
Sometimes surgeons can t see all the cancer to make sure it s removed 
Sometimes radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used before surgery to shrink the cancer 
The energy beams can come from X rays, protons and other sources 
Radiation might be done before surgery to help shrink the MFS 
It might be an option if MFS doesn t respond to other treatments 
They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them 
Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy, also called psychotherapy 
SymptomsSymptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and how severe they are can vary 
Have an unreasonably high sense of self importance and require constant, excessive admiration 
Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate 
Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important 
Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them 
Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others 
Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited 
Insist on having the best of everything for instance, the best car or office 
Become impatient or angry when they don t receive special recognition or treatment 
Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted 
Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change 
Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail 
Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection 
Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, humiliation and fear of being exposed as a failure 
Getting the right treatment can help make your life more rewarding and enjoyable 
Neurobiology the connection between the brain and behavior and thinking 
Get treatment as soon as possible for childhood mental health problems 
Attend parenting classes and seek guidance from a therapist or social worker if needed 
Nasal tumors begin in the main passageway within the nose, called the nasal cavity 
Paranasal tumors begin in air filled chambers around the nose, called the paranasal sinuses 
They can grow to block the flow of air through the nose 
They can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue 
The type of tumor you have helps determine the best treatment for you 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of nasal and paranasal tumors can include 
Sometimes the changes in the DNA turn the cells into cancer cells 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of nasal and paranasal tumors include 
Breathing in polluted air increases the risk of nasal and paranasal tumors 
Being exposed to chemicals and irritants in the air at work 
PreventionTo reduce your risk of nasal and paranasal tumors, you can 
Ask your doctor or other healthcare professional whether an HPV vaccine is right for you 
Larger growths or groups of nasal polyps can block the nose 
They can lead to breathing problems, not being able to smell and infections 
Medicines can often shrink nasal polyps or get rid of them 
But it s possible to have chronic sinusitis without getting nasal polyps 
People who have small nasal polyps might not know they have them 
But having more than one polyp or having a large polyp can block the nose 
Mucus running down the throat, also known as postnasal drip 
They don t know why some people get nasal polyps and others don t 
Having a family history of nasal polyps also might increase the risk 
If you smoke, talk to your health care provider about ways to quit 
This might help prevent the nose from getting stuffy and irritated 
Clean the humidifier as directed to keep bacteria from growing 
You can buy saltwater sprays and nasal wash kits without a prescription 
Use water that s distilled or sterile or has been boiled for one minute and cooled 
Uncorrected nearsightedness can prevent you from performing daily tasks well or enjoying activities 
Recognition of this link has dramatically reduced the incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis 
Some signs and symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis may include 
Skin that may feel woody and develop an orange peel appearance 
Burning, itching or severe sharp pains in areas of involvement 
Skin thickening that inhibits movement, resulting in loss of joint flexibility 
In some people, involvement of muscles and body organs may cause 
Limitation of joint motion caused by muscle tightening contractures in arms, hands, legs and feet 
Reduced internal organ function, including heart, lung, diaphragm, gastrointestinal tract or liver 
Yellow plaques on the white surface sclera of the eyes 
The condition is generally long term chronic , but some people may improve 
In a few people, it can cause severe disability, even death 
Causes The exact cause of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis isn t fully understood 
Have had a kidney transplant but have compromised renal function 
Treatment for nephrotic syndrome includes treating the condition that s causing it and taking medications 
Nephrotic syndrome can increase your risk of infections and blood clots 
Your doctor might recommend medications and dietary changes to prevent complications 
Severe swelling edema , particularly around your eyes and in your ankles and feet 
Foamy urine, a result of excess protein in your urine 
Diabetes can lead to kidney damage diabetic nephropathy that affects the glomeruli 
This is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children 
The cause of the abnormal function typically can t be determined 
This kidney disorder is the result of thickening membranes within the glomeruli 
The thickening is due to deposits made by the immune system 
This chronic inflammatory disease can lead to serious kidney damage 
This disorder occurs when amyloid proteins accumulate in your organs 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of nephrotic syndrome include 
This increases your risk of developing a blood clot in your veins 
At the same time, your liver releases more cholesterol and triglycerides 
Loss of too much blood protein can result in malnutrition 
This can lead to weight loss, which can be masked by edema 
Nephrotic syndrome can cause your kidneys to lose their function over time 
If kidney function falls low enough, you might need dialysis or a kidney transplant 
People with nephrotic syndrome have an increased risk of infections 
Overview Postherpetic neuralgia post hur PET ik noo RAL juh is the most common complication of shingles 
The pain lasts long after the rash and blisters of shingles go away 
Pain that lasts three months or longer after the shingles rash has healed 
Less often, postherpetic neuralgia can cause an itchy feeling or numbness 
When to see a doctorSee a health care provider at the first sign of shingles 
Postherpetic neuralgia happens if nerve fibers get damaged during an outbreak of shingles 
Damaged fibers can t send messages from the skin to the brain as they usually do 
This causes pain that can last months or even years 
Risk factors With shingles, things that can raise the risk of postherpetic neuralgia are 
You had a severe rash and pain that kept you from doing daily activities 
You didn t start taking antiviral medicine within hours of your rash appearing 
Complications People with postherpetic neuralgia can develop other problems that are common with long term pain 
It depends on how long the postherpetic neuralgia lasts and how painful it is 
Ask your health care provider when you should get a vaccine 
Shingrix is suggested even if you ve already had shingles or the older vaccine, Zostavax 
Shingrix is given in two doses, to months apart 
With two doses, Shingrix is more than effective in preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia 
It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain 
People with trigeminal neuralgia may at first experience short, mild episodes of pain 
But the condition can get worse, causing longer periods of pain that happen more often 
It s more common in women and people older than 
But trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, doesn t mean living a life of pain 
SymptomsTrigeminal neuralgia symptoms may include one or more of these patterns 
Episodes of intense shooting or jabbing pain that may feel like an electric shock 
Episodes of pain lasting from a few seconds to several minutes 
These areas include the cheek, jaw, teeth, gums or lips 
Pain on one side of the face at a time 
Or the pain may be spread in a wider pattern 
Episodes of pain that become more frequent and intense over time 
Causes In trigeminal neuralgia, the trigeminal nerve s function is disrupted 
The blood vessel may be an artery or a vein 
This contact puts pressure on the nerve and doesn t allow it to function as usual 
A tumor pressing against the trigeminal nerve also can cause the condition 
Some people may experience trigeminal neuralgia as a result of a stroke or facial trauma 
An injury of the nerve due to surgery also can cause trigeminal neuralgia 
TriggersSeveral triggers may set off the pain of trigeminal neuralgia, including 
Women are more likely than men to experience trigeminal neuralgia 
Trigeminal neuralgia is more common among people and older 
For example, hypertension is a risk factor for trigeminal neuralgia 
In addition, people with multiple sclerosis are at higher risk of trigeminal neuralgia 
A schwannoma is a type of nerve tumor of the nerve sheath 
It s the most common type of benign peripheral nerve tumor in adults 
It can occur anywhere in your body, at any age 
When a schwannoma grows larger, more fascicles are affected, making removal more difficult 
See your doctor if you have any unusual lumps or numbness 
A CT scanner rotates around your body to record a series of images 
Others may need to stay in the hospital for one or two days 
Even after successful removal of the tumor during surgery, a tumor may recur 
Radiation therapy is used to help control the tumor growth and improve your symptoms 
With this technique, doctors deliver radiation precisely to a tumor without making an incision 
The vasovagal syncope trigger causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly 
That leads to reduced blood flow to your brain, causing you to briefly lose consciousness 
But it s possible that you may injure yourself during a vasovagal syncope episode 
SymptomsBefore you faint due to vasovagal syncope, you may experience some of the following 
Recovery after a vasovagal episode generally begins in less than a minute 
Your heart rate slows, and the blood vessels in your legs widen dilate 
This allows blood to pool in your legs, which lowers your blood pressure 
Sometimes there is no classical vasovagal syncope trigger, but common triggers include 
PreventionYou may not always be able to avoid a vasovagal syncope episode 
If you feel like you might faint, lie down and lift your legs 
This allows gravity to keep blood flowing to your brain 
Overview Neuroendocrine tumors are cancers that begin in specialized cells called neuroendocrine cells 
Neuroendocrine cells have traits similar to those of nerve cells and hormone producing cells 
Neuroendocrine tumors are rare and can occur anywhere in the body 
Most neuroendocrine tumors occur in the lungs, appendix, small intestine, rectum and pancreas 
Others don t release hormones or don t release enough to cause symptoms nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors 
SymptomsNeuroendocrine tumors don t always cause signs and symptoms at first 
Neuroendocrine tumors that produce excess hormones functional tumors might cause 
Neuroendocrine tumors begin when neuroendocrine cells develop changes mutations in their DNA 
The DNA inside a cell contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do 
The changes tell the neuroendocrine cells to multiply rapidly and form a tumor 
A neurofibroma can develop within a major or minor nerve anywhere in the body 
This common type of benign nerve tumor tends to form centrally within the nerve 
These tumors are most often found in people ages to years 
Your health care provider will look at several factors to diagnose a neurofibroma 
Surgery may be considered if the tumor is causing symptoms or for cosmetic reasons 
Observation includes regular checkups and imaging tests to see if your tumor is growing 
You may be eligible for a clinical trial testing an experimental treatment 
There are three types of neurofibromatosis neurofibromatosis NF , neurofibromatosis NF and schwannomatosis 
The tumors in these disorders are usually noncancerous benign , but sometimes can become cancerous malignant 
SymptomsThere are three types of neurofibromatosis, each with different signs and symptoms 
Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 
Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity 
Flat, light brown spots on the skin cafe au lait spots 
Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF 
They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life 
Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye Lisch nodules 
These harmless nodules can t easily be seen and don t affect vision 
Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement 
Impaired thinking skills are common in children who have NF but are usually mild 
Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics 
Children who have NF often are below average in height 
Neurofibromatosis Neurofibromatosis NF is much less common than NF 
People who have NF may also develop other benign tumors 
SchwannomatosisThis rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 
Chronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling 
The tumors associated with neurofibromatosis are often benign and slow growing 
The specific genes involved depend on the type of neurofibromatosis 
This gene produces a protein called neurofibromin that helps regulate cell growth 
The mutated gene causes a loss of neurofibromin, which allows cells to grow uncontrolled 
The mutated gene causes a loss of merlin, leading to uncontrolled cell growth 
Complications Complications of neurofibromatosis vary, even within the same family 
Generally, complications result from tumors that affect nerve tissue or press on internal organs 
Learning and thinking difficulties are the most common neurological problems associated with NF 
Uncommon complications include epilepsy and the buildup of excess fluid in the brain 
NF can cause curvature of the spine scoliosis that may need bracing or surgery 
Sometimes a tumor develops on the optic nerve optic glioma , which can affect vision 
Hormonal changes associated with puberty or pregnancy might cause an increase in neurofibromas 
An estimated to of people who have NF develop cancerous tumors 
These usually arise from neurofibromas under the skin or from plexiform neurofibromas 
This noncancerous tumor secretes hormones that raise your blood pressure 
Multiple benign brain tumors or spinal tumors meningiomas requiring frequent surgeries 
This condition often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in the hands and feet 
It also can affect other areas and body functions including digestion and urination 
The peripheral nerves also send sensory information to the central nervous system through sensory nerves 
One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes 
People with peripheral neuropathy usually describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling 
Sometimes symptoms get better, especially if caused by a condition that can be treated 
SymptomsEvery nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job 
Sensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin 
Gradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands 
These sensations can spread upward into your legs and arms 
Feeling as if you re wearing gloves or socks when you re not 
Causes Peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage caused by several different conditions 
These include Sjogren s syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and vasculitis 
Also, some cancers related to the body s immune system can cause polyneuropathy 
These are a form of autoimmune disorder called paraneoplastic syndrome 
Among people with diabetes, more than half will develop some type of neuropathy 
Disorders such as Charcot Marie Tooth disease are hereditary types of neuropathy that run in families 
Toxic substances include industrial chemicals and heavy metals such as lead and mercury 
Certain medicines, especially chemotherapy used to treat cancer, can cause peripheral neuropathy 
Diabetes, especially if your sugar levels are not controlled well 
Low levels of vitamins in the body, especially vitamin B 
Infections, such as Lyme disease, shingles, hepatitis B and C, and HIV 
Your feet and other areas that lack sensation can become injured without your knowing 
Weakness and loss of sensation may be associated with lack of balance and falling 
Overview Niemann Pick disease is a group of rare conditions passed down in families 
Niemann Pick disease can affect the brain, nerves, liver, spleen and bone marrow 
Niemann Pick disease can happen at different ages but mainly affects children 
The condition has no known cure and is sometimes fatal 
Treatment is focused on helping people live with their symptoms 
Loss of muscle control, such as clumsiness and problems walking 
Vision problems, such as vision loss and eye movements that can t be controlled 
Mental health conditions, such as depression, paranoia and behavior problems 
Some infants with type A show symptoms within the first few months of life 
Categories of Niemann Pick diseaseThere are three types of Niemann Pick disease A, B and C 
Niemann Pick disease types A and B are both caused by changes in the SMPD gene 
With these gene changes, an enzyme called sphingomyelinase sfing go MY uh lin ase is missing or doesn t work well 
This enzyme is needed to break down and use lipids called sphingomyelin inside cells 
A buildup of these fats causes cell damage, and over time, the cells die 
Type A the most severe form begins in infancy 
Most children do not live past a few years of age 
Type B sometimes called juvenile onset Niemann Pick disease usually begins later in childhood 
Some people have symptoms that overlap between types A and B 
Niemann Pick disease type C is caused by changes in the NPC and NPC genes 
Cholesterol and other lipids build up in the cells of the liver, spleen or lungs 
This causes problems with eye movements, walking, swallowing, hearing and thinking 
Symptoms vary widely, can appear at any age and get worse over time 
Risk factors Risk factors for Niemann Pick disease depend on the type 
The condition is caused by changes in genes that are passed down in families 
Type B occurs more often in people of North African descent 
Genetic testing and counseling can help you learn about your risks 
Nightmares are common in children but can happen at any age 
Some people have them as adults or throughout their lives 
SymptomsYou re more likely to have a nightmare in the second half of your night 
Nightmares may occur rarely or more frequently, even several times a night 
You feel scared, anxious, angry, sad or disgusted as a result of your dream 
You feel sweaty or have a pounding heartbeat while in bed 
You can think clearly upon awakening and can recall details of your dream 
Your dream causes distress that keeps you from falling back to sleep easily 
Problems with concentration or memory, or you can t stop thinking about images from your dreams 
Problems functioning at work or school or in social situations 
Behavior problems related to bedtime or fear of the dark 
If your child has nightmares, you can simply mention them at a routine well child exam 
Nightmares usually occur during the stage of sleep known as rapid eye movement REM sleep 
Experiencing anxiety is associated with a greater risk of nightmares 
Nightmares are common after an accident, injury, physical or sexual abuse, or other traumatic event 
Nightmares are common in people who have post traumatic stress disorder PTSD 
Alcohol and recreational drug use or withdrawal can trigger nightmares 
Depression and other mental health disorders may be linked to nightmares 
Nightmares can happen along with some medical conditions, such as heart disease or cancer 
Having other sleep disorders that interfere with adequate sleep can be associated with having nightmares 
Problems with mood, such as depression or anxiety from dreams that continue to bother you 
Resistance to going to bed or to sleep for fear you ll have another bad dream 
Nonallergic rhinitis Overview Nonallergic rhinitis involves sneezing or a stuffy, drippy nose 
It can be a long term problem, and it has no clear cause 
The symptoms are like those of hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis 
Factors that trigger the symptoms vary from person to person 
Health care providers often first make sure a person s symptoms aren t caused by allergies 
Nonallergic rhinitis most often doesn t cause an itchy nose, eyes or throat 
That symptom is linked with allergies such as hay fever 
But experts do know that nonallergic rhinitis happens when blood vessels in the nose expand 
These blood vessels fill the tissue that lines the inside of the nose 
For instance, the nerve endings in the nose might react to triggers too easily 
Strong odors such as perfumes also can cause the symptoms to start 
So can chemical fumes, including fumes some workers might get exposed to at their jobs 
Changes in temperature or humidity can trigger swelling in the lining of the nose 
High blood pressure medicines such as beta blockers also can cause symptoms 
Medicines that have a calming effect, called sedatives, can trigger nonallergic rhinitis too 
Birth control pills and medicines that treat erectile dysfunction also can trigger the symptoms 
These can be due to pregnancy, periods or birth control use 
Lying on your back while you sleep can trigger nonallergic rhinitis 
Acid reflux that happens overnight also can be a trigger 
Risk factors Things that can make you more likely to get nonallergic rhinitis include 
Most people who get nonallergic rhinitis are or older 
A stuffy nose or other symptoms might get worse when the decongestant wears off 
Congestion in the nose often gets worse during these times due to hormone changes 
In some lines of work, fumes from supplies can cause nonallergic rhinitis to start 
Some long term health problems can cause nonallergic rhinitis or make it worse 
But larger ones can block the airflow through the nose 
Long term congestion in the nose due to nonallergic rhinitis can raise the risk of sinusitis 
PreventionIf you have nonallergic rhinitis, take steps to ease your symptoms and prevent flare ups 
Find out what factors cause your symptoms or make them worse 
Your health care provider can help you learn your triggers 
Don t use decongestant nose sprays or drops for too long 
If you ve tried a medicine that doesn t help enough, talk to your health care provider 
A change to your treatment plan may be needed to prevent or ease your symptoms 
Nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment depends on the type of cancer 
Skin cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer cells 
A child inherits a copy of an affected gene from a parent 
Doctors manage Noonan syndrome by controlling the symptoms and complications 
SymptomsSymptoms of Noonan syndrome vary greatly and range from mild to severe 
These symptoms may be related to the specific gene containing the change 
the face looks is one key feature that leads to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome 
Ears are set low and look like they re tipped backward 
Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and round tip 
The inside roof of the mouth may be highly arched 
Facial features may appear coarse but look sharper with age 
Some forms of congenital heart disease related to Noonan syndrome include 
Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve 
Pulmonary valve stenosis is the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome 
This can occur with or without other problems in heart structure 
Most people with Noonan syndrome have a heart rhythm that is not regular 
Many children with Noonan syndrome do not grow at a typical rate 
Eating difficulties that may lead to poor nutrition and weight gain 
Short neck, often with extra folds of skin, called a webbed neck 
Learning disabilitiesNoonan syndrome does not affect the intelligence of most people who have the condition 
A higher risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability 
A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild 
Hearing and vision problems that may make it harder to learn 
Eye conditionsCommon signs of Noonan syndrome are eyes and eyelids that are unusual, including 
Problems with the eye muscles, such as cross eye, also known as strabismus 
Bleeding problemsNoonan syndrome can cause bleeding problems and easy bruising 
Some children are born with swelling of the hands, feet and tissue of the neck 
Can focus on a particular area of the body or be widespread 
Genital and kidney conditionsMany people with Noonan syndrome have problems with their genitals and kidneys 
It s common for males with Noonan syndrome to have undescended testicles 
For most females, Noonan syndrome does not affect their ability to get pregnant 
But fertility in males may not develop as expected, often because of undescended testicles 
They may have various problems that affect the color and texture of the skin 
When to see a doctorSometimes the symptoms of Noonan syndrome can be hard to see 
Causes A change in one or more genes can cause Noonan syndrome 
Changes in these genes produce proteins that are always active 
In some cases, the cause of Noonan syndrome is not known 
Complications Complications from Noonan syndrome can arise that may need attention, including 
Children with Noonan syndrome may be slow to develop compared with other children their age 
A plan is needed to address the children s developmental challenges and learning and educational needs 
Sometimes fluid can collect in the space around the heart and lungs 
A kidney structure that is not typical may raise the risk of urinary tract infections 
Norovirus infection Overview Norovirus infection can cause severe vomiting and diarrhea that start suddenly 
Noroviruses can also spread through close contact with a person who has norovirus infection 
Diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting typically begin to hours after exposure 
Norovirus infection occurs most frequently in closed and crowded environments 
Examples include hospitals, nursing homes, child care centers, schools and cruise ships 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of norovirus infection may start suddenly and include 
You can continue to shed virus in your stool for several weeks after recovery 
This shedding can last weeks to months if you have another medical condition 
Some people with norovirus infection may show no signs or symptoms 
However, they re still contagious and can spread the virus to others 
That means the norovirus infection can easily spread to others 
Noroviruses can stay on surfaces and objects for days or weeks 
Being in close contact with a person who has norovirus infection 
Risk factors Risk factors for becoming infected with a norovirus include 
Staying in hotels, resorts, cruise ships or other destinations with many people in close quarters 
Children who are dehydrated might cry with few or no tears 
Alcohol based hand sanitizers aren t as effective against noroviruses as using soap and water 
Avoid handling food and items to be used by other people 
Disturb soiled material as little as possible to avoid spreading noroviruses by air 
Place soiled items in plastic bags and place them in the trash 
Remove and wash clothes and linens that may be contaminated 
Avoid traveling until to days after your symptoms are gone 
There might be a need to pass urine many times during the day and night 
There also might be loss of urine that isn t intended, called urgency incontinence 
Simple behavior changes might manage symptoms of an overactive bladder 
Feel a sudden urge to urinate that s hard to control 
Lose urine without meaning to after an urgent need to urinate, called urgency incontinence 
This can mean eight or more times in hours 
Wake up more than twice a night to urinate, called nocturia 
It might not be easy to talk about your symptoms 
But if the symptoms distress you or disrupt your life, talk to your healthcare professional 
Causes How a healthy bladder worksThe kidneys make urine, which drains into the bladder 
When urinating, urine passes from the bladder through a tube called the urethra u REE thruh 
In people assigned female at birth, the urethral opening is just above the vaginal opening 
As the bladder fills, nerve signals sent to the brain trigger the need to urinate 
The muscles of the bladder tighten, also called contract, pushing the urine out 
Several conditions may be a part of overactive bladder, including 
Conditions that affect the bladder, such as tumors or bladder stones 
Conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord, such as stroke and multiple sclerosis 
Urinary tract infections, which can cause symptoms like those of an overactive bladder 
This leads to not enough space in the bladder for more urine 
Risk factors Aging increases the risk of overactive bladder 
Conditions such as enlarged prostate and diabetes also can increase the risk 
That s because they re less able to notice the symptoms of needing to urinate 
Some people with an overactive bladder also have trouble with bowel control 
Tell your healthcare professional if you re having trouble controlling your bowels 
Complications Any type of incontinence can affect quality of life 
If your overactive bladder symptoms disrupt your life, you might also have 
PreventionThese healthy lifestyle choices may reduce your risk of overactive bladder 
Manage ongoing, called chronic, conditions, such as diabetes, that might add to overactive bladder symptoms 
Overview Obesity is a complex disease involving having too much body fat 
It s a medical problem that increases the risk of many other diseases and health problems 
There are many reasons why some people have trouble losing weight 
A healthier diet, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight 
Prescription medicines and weight loss procedures are other options for treating obesity 
SymptomsBody mass index, known as BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity 
Or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared 
There are several online calculators available that help calculate BMI 
For most people, BMI provides a reasonable estimate of body fat 
Many health care professionals also measure around a person s waist to help guide treatment decisions 
They re more common in women with a waist measurement over inches centimeters 
Risk factors Obesity often results from a combination of causes and contributing factors 
Family members also tend to share similar eating and activity habits 
People can drink many calories without feeling full, especially calories from alcohol 
Other high calorie beverages, such as sugared soft drinks, can contribute to weight gain 
Some medicines can lead to weight gain if you don t compensate through diet or activity 
Social and economic issuesSocial and economic factors are linked to obesity 
It s hard to avoid obesity if you don t have safe areas to walk or exercise 
Also, the people you spend time with may influence your weight 
You re more likely to develop obesity if you have friends or relatives with obesity 
AgeObesity can occur at any age, even in young children 
The amount of muscle in your body also tends to decrease with age 
Lower muscle mass often leads to a decrease in metabolism 
Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born 
This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women 
And for some, it can lead to enough weight gain to qualify as obesity 
Often, this happens as people use food to cope with smoking withdrawal 
Your health care team can help you prevent weight gain after quitting smoking 
Not getting enough sleep can cause changes in hormones that increase appetite 
Many external factors that affect mood and well being may contribute to obesity 
You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise 
Behavior changes, medicines and procedures for obesity also can help 
Obesity can affect the way the body uses insulin to control blood sugar levels 
Obesity increases the likelihood of developing heartburn, gallbladder disease and liver problems 
In some cases, this can lead to serious liver damage, known as liver cirrhosis 
Quality of lifeObesity can diminish the overall quality of life 
You may not be able to do physical activities that you used to enjoy 
Other weight related issues that may affect your quality of life include 
Overview Obsessive compulsive disorder OCD features a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears known as obsessions 
These obsessions lead you to do repetitive behaviors, also called compulsions 
Ultimately, you feel driven to do compulsive acts to ease your stress 
If you have OCD, you may be ashamed, embarrassed and frustrated about the condition 
But it s also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms 
You may or may not know that your obsessions and compulsions are beyond reason 
These obsessions usually intrude when you re trying to think of or do other things 
Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others 
Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched 
Doubts that you ve locked the door or turned off the stove 
Intense stress when objects aren t orderly or facing a certain way 
Images of driving your car into a crowd of people 
Thoughts about shouting obscenities or not acting the right way in public 
Staying away from situations that can cause obsessions, such as shaking hands 
Compulsion symptomsOCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to do 
Checking doors over and over again to make sure they re locked 
Checking the stove over and over again to make sure it s off 
Trying to replace a bad thought with a good thought 
The types of obsessions and compulsions you have also can change over time 
OCD may be due to changes in your body s natural chemistry or brain functions 
OCD may have a genetic component, but specific genes have yet to be found 
Risk factors Factors that may raise the risk of causing obsessive compulsive disorder include 
If you ve gone through traumatic or stressful events, your risk may increase 
This reaction may cause the intrusive thoughts, rituals and emotional distress seen in OCD 
Having a hard time going to work or school or taking part in social activities 
Overview Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common sleep related breathing disorder 
People with obstructive sleep apnea repeatedly stop and start breathing while they sleep 
Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway 
Another option is a mouthpiece to thrust the lower jaw forward during sleep 
Awakening in the morning with a dry mouth or sore throat 
Snoring loud enough to disturb your sleep or the sleep of others 
Excessive daytime drowsiness may be due to other disorders, such as narcolepsy 
The muscles also support the tongue and side walls of the throat 
When the muscles relax, the airway narrows or closes as you breathe in 
This awakening is usually so brief that you don t remember it 
Or you might make a snorting, choking or gasping sound 
People with obstructive sleep apnea might not be aware of their interrupted sleep 
Most but not all people with obstructive sleep apnea are overweight 
A naturally narrow airway is a trait that can be passed down in your family 
Or your tonsils or adenoids might become enlarged and block your airway 
Obstructive sleep apnea is relatively common in people with hypertension 
People who smoke are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea 
Obstructive sleep apnea might be more common in people with diabetes 
However, the risk of obstructive sleep apnea increases in women after menopause 
Having family members with obstructive sleep apnea might increase your risk 
Research has found an association between asthma and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea 
Complications Obstructive sleep apnea is considered a serious medical condition 
This can put them at higher risk of work related accidents 
Obstructive sleep apnea also increases the risk of heart rhythm problems known as arrhythmias 
Obstructive sleep apnea also is a concern with certain medicines and general anesthesia 
If you have obstructive sleep apnea, having major surgery can worsen breathing problems 
People with obstructive sleep apnea might be more prone to complications after surgery 
You may need to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea before surgery 
Obstructive sleep apnea might be a risk factor for COVID 
The condition occurs when the upper airway narrows or is blocked during sleep 
There are differences between pediatric obstructive sleep apnea and adult sleep apnea 
While adults usually have daytime sleepiness, children are more likely to have behavioral problems 
The adenoids are two small pads of tissue found in the back of the nose 
The tonsils are two oval shaped pads in the back of the mouth 
Infants and young children with obstructive sleep apnea don t always snore 
Causes In adults, obesity is a common factor in obstructive sleep apnea 
Besides obesity, other risk factors for pediatric sleep apnea include having 
Overview Ocular rosacea roe ZAY she uh is inflammation that causes redness, burning and itching of the eyes 
Ocular rosacea primarily affects adults between the ages of and 
It seems to develop in people who tend to blush and flush easily 
Grittiness or the feeling of having a foreign body in the eye or eyes 
Recurrent eye or eyelid infections, such as pink eye conjunctivitis , blepharitis, sties or chalazia 
The severity of ocular rosacea symptoms doesn t always match the severity of skin symptoms 
Causes The exact cause of ocular rosacea, like skin rosacea, is unknown 
It may be due to one or more factors, including 
A number of factors that aggravate skin rosacea can aggravate ocular rosacea, as well 
Skin rosacea affects more women than men, and ocular rosacea affects men and women equally 
It s also more common in fair skinned people of Celtic and Northern European origin 
Overview Even the best behaved children can be difficult and challenging at times 
ODD also includes being spiteful and seeking revenge, a behavior called vindictiveness 
Your health care provider, a mental health professional and a child development expert can help 
Other therapy, and possibly medicines, may be needed to treat related mental health conditions 
It s common for children to show oppositional behavior at certain stages of development 
Sometimes ODD may develop later, but almost always before the early teen years 
Emotional and behavioral symptoms of ODD generally last at least six months 
They include angry and irritable mood, argumentative and defiant behavior, and hurtful and revengeful behavior 
Often actively defies or refuses to follow adults requests or rules 
Tries to hurt the feelings of others and seeks revenge, also called being vindictive 
Has shown vindictive behavior at least twice in the past six months 
For some children, symptoms may first be seen only at home 
Instead, your child will probably complain about unreasonable demands or blame others for problems 
Causes There s no known clear cause of oppositional defiant disorder 
Causes may include a combination of genetic and environmental factors 
Differences in the way nerves and the brain function also may play a role 
Risk factors Oppositional defiant disorder is a complex problem 
Children and teens with ODD may struggle to make and keep friends and relationships 
Many children and teens with ODD also have other mental health conditions, such as 
Treating these other mental health conditions may help reduce ODD symptoms 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Overview Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is an exaggerated response to excess hormones 
Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may worsen or improve over time 
Mild to moderate OHSSWith mild to moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, symptoms can include 
Some women who use injectable fertility drugs get a mild form of OHSS 
But, if pregnancy occurs, symptoms of OHSS may worsen and last several days to weeks 
Rapid weight gain more than pounds kilogram in hours 
This may indicate an urgent situation that needs prompt medical attention 
Causes The cause of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome isn t fully understood 
Ovarian blood vessels react abnormally to human chorionic gonadotropin HCG and begin to leak fluid 
This fluid swells the ovaries, and sometimes large amounts move into the abdomen 
OHSS usually happens within a week after you receive an HCG injection 
Risk factors Sometimes, OHSS happens in women with no risk factors at all 
But factors that are known to increase your risk of OHSS include 
High or steeply increasing level of estradiol estrogen before an HCG trigger shot 
Complications Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is uncommon, but can be life threatening 
Rupture of a cyst in an ovary, which can lead to serious bleeding 
Some medications seem to reduce the risk of OHSS without affecting the odds of pregnancy 
These include low dose aspirin dopamine agonists such as carbergoline or quinogloide and calcium infusions 
Mature follicles are fertilized and frozen, and your ovaries are allowed to rest 
You can resume the IVF process at a later date, when your body is ready 
OligodendrogliomaOligodendroglioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain 
The growth of cells, called a tumor, begins in cells called oligodendrocytes 
Oligodendroglioma is most common in adults, but it can happen at any age 
Symptoms include seizures, headaches, and weakness or disability in a certain part of the body 
During a neurological exam, you re asked about signs and symptoms 
Your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes are checked 
Imaging tests can help determine where the brain tumor is and its size 
When possible, the sample is removed during surgery to remove the tumor 
Which method is used depends on your situation and the location of the tumor 
Your care team uses this information to create a treatment plan 
The goal of surgery is to remove as much of the oligodendroglioma as possible 
One way to do this is called awake brain surgery 
During this type of surgery, you re awakened from a sleep like state 
The surgeon might ask questions and monitor the activity in your brain as you reply 
This helps show the important parts of the brain so the surgeon can avoid them 
Rarely, another disease called neuromyelitis optica causes inflammation of the optic nerve and spinal cord 
Sometimes steroid medications may speed the recovery of vision after optic neuritis 
Most people who develop optic neuritis have eye pain that s worsened by eye movement 
Sometimes the pain feels like a dull ache behind the eye 
You might notice that colors appear less vivid than normal 
Some people with optic neuritis report seeing flashing or flickering lights with eye movements 
You develop new symptoms, such as eye pain or a change in your vision 
The following autoimmune conditions often are associated with optic neuritis 
In this condition, inflammation affects the optic nerve and spinal cord 
This condition can cause inflammation to the optic nerve, spinal cord or brain 
Similar to MS and neuromyelitis optica, recurrent attacks of inflammation can occur 
Recovery from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG attacks is usually better than recovery from neuromyelitis optica 
Diseases such as sarcoidosis, Behcet s disease and lupus can cause recurrent optic neuritis 
Some drugs and toxins have been associated with the development of optic neuritis 
Risk factors Risk factors for developing optic neuritis include 
Optic neuritis most often affects adults ages to 
Women are much more likely to develop optic neuritis than men are 
Certain genetic mutations might increase your risk of developing optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis 
Complications Complications arising from optic neuritis may include 
Overview Orchitis or KIE tis is an inflammation of one or both testicles 
Bacterial or viral infections can cause orchitis, or the cause can be unknown 
But it can take several weeks for scrotal tenderness to disappear 
SymptomsOrchitis signs and symptoms usually develop suddenly and can include 
The terms testicle pain and groin pain are sometimes used interchangeably 
The causes of groin pain are different from the causes of testicle pain 
A number of conditions can cause testicle pain, and some require immediate treatment 
Your doctor can perform tests to determine which condition is causing your pain 
Causes Orchitis can be caused by a bacterial or viral infection 
Bacterial orchitisMost often, bacterial orchitis is associated with or the result of epididymitis 
Risk factors Risk factors for nonsexually transmitted orchitis include 
Sexual behaviors that can lead to STIs put you at risk of sexually transmitted orchitis 
Occasionally, orchitis can cause infertility or inadequate testosterone production hypogonadism 
But these are less likely if orchitis affects only one testicle 
Get immunized against mumps, the most common cause of viral orchitis 
Practice safe sex, to help protect against STIs that can cause bacterial orchitis 
Orthostatic hypotension postural hypotension Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Orthostatic hypotension can cause dizziness or lightheadedness and possibly fainting 
Dizziness or lightheadedness can also result from standing after sitting for a long time 
If these symptoms happen only occasionally, there s likely no cause for concern 
It s important to see a health care provider for frequent symptoms of orthostatic hypotension 
Losing consciousness, even for just a few seconds, is serious 
Blood pressure drops because there s less blood flowing back to the heart 
Usually, special cells baroreceptors near the heart and neck arteries sense this lower blood pressure 
These cells also narrow the blood vessels and increase blood pressure 
Mild dehydration can cause symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, such as weakness, dizziness and fatigue 
These conditions prevent the body from quickly pumping more blood when standing up 
Thyroid conditions, adrenal insufficiency Addison s disease and low blood sugar hypoglycemia can cause orthostatic hypotension 
Some people have low blood pressure after eating meals postprandial hypotension 
Risk factors The risk factors for orthostatic hypotension include 
Orthostatic hypotension is common in those who are age and older 
They also include certain nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson s disease 
And they include diseases that cause nerve damage neuropathy , such as diabetes 
Complications Persistent orthostatic hypotension can cause serious complications, especially in older adults 
Falling as a result of fainting is a common complication in people with orthostatic hypotension 
This bone and cartilage can then break loose, causing pain and possibly hindering joint motion 
For young children whose bones are still developing, the injury might heal by itself 
SymptomsDepending on the joint that s affected, signs and symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans might include 
The skin around your joint might be swollen and tender 
You might feel as though your joint is giving way or weakening 
You might be unable to straighten the affected limb completely 
There might be a genetic component, making some people more inclined to develop the disorder 
Complications Osteochondritis dissecans can increase your risk of eventually developing osteoarthritis in that joint 
Overview Osteosarcoma is a kind of cancer that begins in the cells that form bones 
Osteosarcoma tends to happen most often in teenagers and young adults 
But it also can happen in younger children and older adults 
It s most often found in the long bones of the legs, and sometimes the arms 
Very rarely, it happens in soft tissue outside the bone 
Advances in the treatment of osteosarcoma have improved the outlook for this cancer 
Healthcare professionals often suggest lifelong monitoring for side effects after treatment 
SymptomsOsteosarcoma signs and symptoms most often start in a bone 
The cancer most often affects the long bones of the legs, and sometimes the arms 
Pain related to a bone that breaks for no clear reason 
Osteosarcoma symptoms are like those of many more common conditions, such as sports injuries 
Osteosarcoma happens when bone cells develop changes in their DNA 
A cell s DNA holds the instructions, called genes, that tell a cell what to do 
These include hereditary retinoblastoma, Bloom syndrome, Li Fraumeni syndrome, Rothmund Thomson syndrome and Werner syndrome 
Complications Complications of osteosarcoma and its treatment include the following 
Cancer that spreads, also called metastasizesOsteosarcoma can spread from where it started to other areas 
Osteosarcoma most often spreads to the lungs, the same bone or another bone 
Learning to use an artificial limb, called a prosthesis, takes time, practice and patience 
Osteoporosis related breaks most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine 
Bone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down and replaced 
SymptomsThere typically are no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss 
Back pain, caused by a broken or collapsed bone in the spine 
As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it s created 
Peak bone mass is partly inherited and varies also by ethnic group 
Unchangeable risksSome risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control, including 
Women are much more likely to develop osteoporosis than are men 
The older you get, the greater your risk of osteoporosis 
You re at greatest risk of osteoporosis if you re white or of Asian descent 
Osteoporosis has also been associated with overactive parathyroid and adrenal glands 
Dietary factorsOsteoporosis is more likely to occur in people who have 
A lifelong lack of calcium plays a role in the development of osteoporosis 
Severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women 
These surgeries include those to help you lose weight and for other gastrointestinal disorders 
Osteoporosis has also been associated with medications used to combat or prevent 
Medical problemsThe risk of osteoporosis is higher in people who have certain medical problems, including 
Lifestyle choicesSome bad habits can increase your risk of osteoporosis 
Regular consumption of more than two alcoholic drinks a day increases the risk of osteoporosis 
In some cases, broken bones in the spine can occur even if you haven t fallen 
PreventionGood nutrition and regular exercise are essential for keeping your bones healthy throughout your life 
This daily amount increases to , milligrams when women turn and men turn 
However, too much calcium has been linked to kidney stones 
Dietary sources of vitamin D include cod liver oil, trout and salmon 
Many types of milk and cereal have been fortified with vitamin D 
Most people need at least international units IU of vitamin D a day 
That recommendation increases to IU a day after age 
ExerciseExercise can help you build strong bones and slow bone loss 
Strength training helps strengthen muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine 
Ear infection middle ear Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
This may cause leg pain when walking claudication and other symptoms 
SymptomsMany people with peripheral artery disease have mild or no symptoms 
Coldness in the lower leg or foot, especially when compared with the other side 
No pulse or a weak pulse in the legs or feet 
Sores on the toes, feet or legs that won t heal 
If peripheral artery disease gets worse, pain may occur during rest or when lying down 
Other things that increase the risk of peripheral artery disease include 
A family history of peripheral artery disease, heart disease or stroke 
Increasing age, especially after or after if you have risk factors for atherosclerosis 
Complications Complications of peripheral artery disease caused by atherosclerosis include 
In this condition, an injury or infection causes tissue to die 
Symptoms include open sores on the limbs that don t heal 
The back of the lower leg is called the calf 
The pain occurs during exercise and goes away with rest 
Blood clot in the lower leg, called deep vein thrombosis 
Symptoms typically affect young, otherwise healthy people under age 
The condition may be seen at birth, or it may occur later in life 
Risk factors Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome PAES is uncommon 
PAES can occur in anyone, but it s much more common in young men 
Complications Long term pressure on the popliteal artery can cause the artery to narrow 
It can cause pain and cramping with just slight activity, such as walking 
Paget s disease of bone Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The pelvis, skull, spine and legs are most commonly affected 
Complications can include broken bones, hearing loss and pinched nerves in your spine 
SymptomsMost people who have Paget s disease of bone have no symptoms 
When symptoms occur, the most common complaint is bone pain 
Your signs and symptoms, if any, will depend on the affected part of your body 
Paget s disease of bone in the pelvis can cause hip pain 
An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause hearing loss or headaches 
If your spine is affected, nerve roots can become compressed 
This can cause pain, tingling and numbness in an arm or leg 
As the bones weaken, they may bend causing you to become bowlegged 
When to see a doctorTalk to your doctor if you have 
Unexplained hearing loss, especially if it s only on one side 
Causes The cause of Paget s disease of bone is unknown 
Scientists suspect a combination of environmental and genetic factors contribute to the disease 
Several genes appear to be linked to getting the disease 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of Paget s disease of bone include 
People older than are most likely to develop the disease 
Complications In most cases, Paget s disease of bone progresses slowly 
The disease can be managed effectively in nearly all people 
Leg bones can bow, which can affect your ability to walk 
Misshapen bones can increase the amount of stress on nearby joints, which can cause osteoarthritis 
Bone cancer occurs in up to of people with Paget s disease of bone 
Paget s disease of the breast Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Paget s disease of the breast occurs most often after age 
Only rarely is Paget s disease of the breast confined to the nipple itself 
SymptomsPaget s disease of the breast affects your nipple and usually the skin areola surrounding it 
Possible signs and symptoms of Paget s disease of the breast include 
Crusty, oozing or hardened skin resembling eczema on the nipple, areola or both 
On average, signs and symptoms occur for several months before a diagnosis is made 
When to see a doctorBe aware of any changes in your breasts 
Causes Doctors don t know what causes Paget s disease of the breast 
Another theory is that the disease can develop independently in the nipple 
Some factors that make you more susceptible to breast cancer include 
The most well known gene mutations are referred to as BRCA and BRCA 
If you began menopause at an older age, you re more likely to develop breast cancer 
If you ve never been pregnant, your risk of breast cancer may be increased 
Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of screening 
Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening strategies are right for you 
If you haven t been active lately, ask your doctor whether it s OK and start slowly 
Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy 
If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy strategies to accomplish this 
Overview Wrist pain is often caused by sprains or fractures from sudden injuries 
But an accurate diagnosis is essential for proper treatment and healing 
For example, osteoarthritis pain often is described as being similar to a dull toothache 
The precise location of wrist pain also provides clues to what s behind the symptoms 
When to see a doctorNot all wrist pain requires medical care 
Wrist injuries often occur when you fall forward onto your outstretched hand 
A scaphoid fracture involves a bone on the thumb side of the wrist 
This type of fracture may not show up on X rays immediately after the injury 
Some examples include hitting a tennis ball, bowing a cello or driving cross country 
If one wrist is affected, the other one usually is too 
Ganglion cysts may be painful, and pain may either worsen or improve with activity 
Kienbock disease occurs when there is not enough blood supply to this bone 
These can include football, bowling, golf, gymnastics, snowboarding and tennis 
For most adults, that means , to , milligrams a day 
Falling forward onto an outstretched hand is the main cause of most wrist injuries 
And install grab bars in your bathroom and handrails on your stairways, if necessary 
Wear wrist guards for high risk activities, such as football, snowboarding and rollerblading 
If you spend long periods at a keyboard, take regular breaks 
When you type, keep your wrists in a relaxed, neutral position 
An ergonomic keyboard and a foam or gel wrist support may help 
You may have occasional panic attacks, or they may occur frequently 
Panic attacks have many variations, but symptoms usually peak within minutes 
You may feel fatigued and worn out after a panic attack subsides 
Panic attacks typically include some of these signs or symptoms 
that is more sensitive to stress or prone to negative emotions 
Certain changes in the way parts of your brain function 
For example, if a grizzly bear came after you, your body would react instinctively 
Many of the same reactions occur in a panic attack 
But it s unknown why a panic attack occurs when there s no obvious danger present 
Factors that may increase the risk of developing panic attacks or panic disorder include 
Major life stress, such as the death or serious illness of a loved one 
A traumatic event, such as sexual assault or a serious accident 
Major changes in your life, such as a divorce or the addition of a baby 
Complications that panic attacks may cause or be linked to include 
Development of specific phobias, such as fear of driving or leaving your home 
Frequent medical care for health concerns and other medical conditions 
PreventionThere s no sure way to prevent panic attacks or panic disorder 
Stick with your treatment plan to help prevent relapses or worsening of panic attack symptoms 
Get regular physical activity, which may play a role in protecting against anxiety 
Extra blood flows to the right side of the heart 
The hole lets blood flow between the upper heart chambers 
A child born with Turner syndrome has an increased risk of PAPVR 
DiagnosisIf PAPVR occurs with other heart problems, it may be diagnosed soon after birth 
If the condition is mild, it may not be diagnosed until adulthood 
A whooshing sound, called a heart murmur, may be heard 
An echocardiogram is done to diagnose partial anomalous pulmonary venous return 
This test uses sound waves to create images of the beating heart 
An echocardiogram shows the pulmonary veins and the size of the heart chambers 
An echocardiogram can help diagnose a hole in the heart 
A lot of oxygen rich and oxygen poor blood mixes in the heart 
If you don t have symptoms, surgery may not be needed 
Reconnects the pulmonary veins to the left upper heart chamber 
It s best to see a health care provider who is trained in congenital heart diseases 
When chromaffin cells become abnormal they can form growths tumors 
When the tumors happen in the adrenal glands they re called pheochromocytomas 
When the tumors happen elsewhere in the body they re called paragangliomas 
Paraganglioma cells commonly secrete hormones known as catecholamines, including adrenaline, which is the fight or flight hormone 
This can cause episodes of high blood pressure, a rapid heartbeat, sweating, headache and tremors 
Paraganglioma treatment most often involves surgery to remove the tumor 
Paragangliomas are sometimes caused by gene mutations that can be passed from parents to children 
Genetic testing may be recommended as part of your care 
Ask your doctor about his or her experiencing treating paraganglioma 
It s necessary to lower and control the hormone levels before you begin paraganglioma treatment 
Medications used to control hormone levels include alpha blockers, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers 
Other measures might include eating a diet high in sodium and drinking plenty of fluids 
Radiation therapy uses high energy beams, such as X rays and protons, to control tumor growth 
Radiation therapy might be recommended if the paraganglioma can t be removed completely with surgery 
Another type of treatment called cryoablation uses cold gas to freeze the tumors cells 
If your paraganglioma has spread, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy to help shrink the tumors 
If you re interested in clinical trials, talk with your doctor about your options 
Together you can consider the benefits and risks of experimental treatments 
Instead, your doctor may monitor your condition during regular follow up appointments 
The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand 
Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause stiffness or slowing of movement 
In the early stages of Parkinson s disease, your face may show little or no expression 
Parkinson s disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time 
Although Parkinson s disease can t be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms 
Rhythmic shaking, called tremor, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers 
You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth 
Over time, Parkinson s disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time consuming 
It may be difficult to get out of a chair 
You may drag or shuffle your feet as you try to walk 
Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body 
The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion 
Or you may fall or have balance problems as a result of Parkinson s disease 
You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking 
Your speech may be more of a monotone rather than have the usual speech patterns 
It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small 
Researchers have identified specific genetic changes that can cause Parkinson s disease 
Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic markers of Parkinson s disease 
It s found in all Lewy bodies in a clumped form that cells can t break down 
This is currently an important focus among Parkinson s disease researchers 
Risk factors Risk factors for Parkinson s disease include 
It ordinarily begins in middle or late life, and the risk increases with age 
People usually develop the disease around age or older 
Having a close relative with Parkinson s disease increases the chances that you ll develop the disease 
Men are more likely to develop Parkinson s disease than are women 
Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your risk of Parkinson s disease 
Complications Parkinson s disease is often accompanied by these additional problems, which may be treatable 
You may experience cognitive problems, such as dementia, and thinking difficulties 
These usually occur in the later stages of Parkinson s disease 
You may experience depression, sometimes in the very early stages 
You also may experience other emotional changes, such as fear, anxiety or loss of motivation 
Your health care team may give you medicine to treat these symptoms 
You may develop difficulties with swallowing as your condition progresses 
Saliva may accumulate in your mouth due to slowed swallowing, leading to drooling 
Late stage Parkinson s disease affects the muscles in the mouth, making chewing difficult 
People also may experience rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, which involves acting out dreams 
Many people with Parkinson s disease develop constipation, mainly due to a slower digestive tract 
You may have trouble identifying certain odors or the difference between odors 
Many people with Parkinson s disease lose energy and experience fatigue, especially later in the day 
Some people with Parkinson s disease notice a decrease in sexual desire or performance 
Some research has shown that regular aerobic exercise might reduce the risk of Parkinson s disease 
Green tea also is related to a reduced risk of developing Parkinson s disease 
Currently there is not enough evidence to suggest that drinking caffeinated beverages protects against Parkinson s 
Parotid tumorsParotid tumors are growths of cells that start in the parotid glands 
The parotid glands are two salivary glands that sit just in front of the ears 
Salivary glands make saliva to help with chewing and digesting food 
There are many salivary glands in the lips, cheeks, mouth and throat 
Growths of cells, which are called tumors, can happen in any of these glands 
The parotid glands are the most common place that salivary gland tumors happen 
These are called malignant parotid tumors or parotid gland cancers 
Parotid tumors often cause swelling in the face or jaw 
Other symptoms include problems swallowing or a loss of facial movement 
DiagnosisTests and procedures used to diagnose a parotid tumor may include 
A health care provider feels the jaw, neck and throat for lumps or swelling 
A biopsy is a procedure to collect a sample of tissue for testing 
It typically involves using a needle to collect fluid or tissue from the parotid gland 
Sometimes the results say a tumor isn t cancerous when it is 
For this reason, some doctors don t do a biopsy before surgery 
Instead, they may take a sample of tissue for testing during surgery 
Imaging tests help your health care team understand the size and location of your tumor 
TreatmentParotid tumor treatment often involves surgery to remove the tumor 
If the tumor is cancerous, you might need more treatment 
The part of the parotid gland that s left continues working as before 
Surgery to remove all of the parotid gland is called parotidectomy 
This type of surgery isn t needed for parotid tumors that aren t cancerous 
The cut is often hidden in a crease of skin or behind the ear 
Sometimes a sample of tumor tissue is tested during surgery to see if it s cancer 
The pathologist tells the surgeon if the tumor is cancerous 
This helps the surgeon decide how much of the parotid gland to remove 
The pathologist also might test nearby lymph nodes and other tissue for signs of cancer 
The parotid gland surrounds the nerve that moves the muscles of the face 
This can cause loss of movement in the face muscles 
Rarely, the facial nerve must be cut in order to get all of the tumor 
It requires well trained surgeons and specialists for the best outcome 
Learning more about the procedure can help you feel more comfortable about your treatment plan 
Where will you cut into the skin to reach the parotid gland 
How much of the parotid gland do you plan to remove 
How likely is it that the facial nerve will be hurt 
How will you be sure that you ve removed all of the tumor 
If surgery isn t possible, radiation therapy might be the first treatment for parotid cancers 
In these situations, chemotherapy might be done at the same time as radiation therapy 
Chemotherapy may help relieve pain and other symptoms caused by the cancer 
SymptomsPatellofemoral pain syndrome usually causes a dull, aching pain in the front of the knee 
Sitting with a bent knee for long periods of time 
Moving the knee inward during a squat has been linked to patellofemoral pain 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk include 
Arthritis is more often to blame for knee problems in older people 
Women are twice as likely as men are to develop patellofemoral pain 
A wider pelvis increases the angle at which the bones in the knee joint meet 
Running and jumping sports can put extra stress on the knees 
Strong leg and hip muscles help keep the knee balanced during activity 
Ask a physical therapist about exercises to help you jump, run and turn correctly 
If you re overweight, losing weight relieves stress on the knees 
Wear shoes that fit well and are designed for the activity 
If it remains open, it s called a patent ductus arteriosus 
A small patent ductus arteriosus often doesn t cause problems and might never need treatment 
However, a large, untreated patent ductus arteriosus can let oxygen poor blood move the wrong way 
This can weaken the heart muscle, causing heart failure and other complications 
A large PDA can cause symptoms of heart failure soon after birth 
A large PDA found during infancy or childhood might cause 
When to see a doctorContact the doctor if your baby or older child 
Causes The exact causes of congenital heart defects are unclear 
During the first six weeks of pregnancy, a baby s heart starts to form and beat 
The major blood vessels to and from the heart grow 
It s during this time that certain heart defects may begin to develop 
The opening is necessary for a baby s blood flow before birth 
It moves blood away from a baby s lungs while they develop 
When it stays open, it s called a patent ductus arteriosus 
The persistent opening causes too much blood to flow to the baby s lungs and heart 
Untreated, the blood pressure in the baby s lungs might increase 
Risk factors Risk factors for patent ductus arteriosus PDA include 
Complications A small patent ductus arteriosus might not cause complications 
High blood pressure in the lungs, also called pulmonary hypertension 
A large PDA causes irregular blood flow in the heart and lungs 
A life threatening and permanent type of lung damage called Eisenmenger syndrome may occur 
A patent ductus arteriosus can increase the risk of infection of the heart tissue 
Before becoming pregnant, talk to your health care provider about possible pregnancy risks and complications 
Some heart medicines can cause serious problems for a developing baby 
Your health care provider may stop or change your medicines before you become pregnant 
However, it s important to do everything possible to have a healthy pregnancy 
It also may help reduce the risk of heart problems 
Work with your health care provider to develop an exercise plan that s right for you 
Certain types of infections can be harmful to a developing baby 
As a result, the condition can be embarrassing and disruptive to your daily life 
Pseudobulbar affect often goes undiagnosed or is mistaken for mood disorders 
Once diagnosed, however, pseudobulbar affect can be managed with medication 
Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time 
Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing 
For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment 
These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded 
Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression 
But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect 
If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor 
Causes Pseudobulbar affect PBA typically occurs in people with neurological conditions or injuries, including 
Complications Severe symptoms of pseudobulbar affect PBA can cause embarrassment, social isolation, anxiety and depression 
If you have PCOS, you may not have periods very often 
You may also have too much of a hormone called androgen in your body 
With PCOS, many small sacs of fluid develop along the outer edge of the ovary 
SymptomsSymptoms of PCOS often start around the time of the first menstrual period 
Sometimes symptoms develop later after you have had periods for a while 
A diagnosis of PCOS is made when you have at least two of these 
Having few menstrual periods or having periods that aren t regular are common signs of PCOS 
For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year 
And those periods may occur more than days apart 
High levels of the hormone androgen may result in excess facial and body hair 
Many follicles containing immature eggs may develop around the edge of the ovary 
PCOS signs and symptoms are typically more severe in people with obesity 
These might include new hair growth on your face and body, acne and male pattern baldness 
It allows cells to use sugar, your body s primary energy supply 
You could have trouble with ovulation, the process where eggs are released from the ovary 
A bigger appetite and weight gain may be other signs 
White blood cells make substances in response to infection or injury 
Research suggests that certain genes might be linked to PCOS 
Having a family history of PCOS may play a role in developing the condition 
With PCOS, the ovaries may produce high levels of androgen 
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis a severe liver inflammation caused by fat buildup in the liver 
Obesity commonly occurs with PCOS and can worsen complications of the disorder 
Low white blood cell count leukopenia means having too few leukocytes circulating in the blood 
There are several types of white blood cells, each with a different disease fighting activity 
White blood cell disorders involving a specific type of white blood cell include 
In addition, certain medications and other diseases or conditions can cause neutropenia 
Monocytes help get rid of dead or damaged tissue and regulate your body s immune response 
Infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases and other conditions can cause an increased number of monocytes 
A decreased number can be the result of toxins, chemotherapy and other causes 
A decreased number of basophils can result from allergic reactions or infections 
An increased number can be caused by certain types of blood cancer or other disorders 
Pelvic inflammatory disease PID Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease can be subtle or mild 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease might be mild and difficult to recognize 
When signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease PID are present, they most often include 
Pain ranging from mild to severe in your lower abdomen and pelvis 
Unusual or heavy vaginal discharge that may have an unpleasant odor 
Unusual bleeding from the vagina, especially during or after sex, or between periods 
Nausea and vomiting, with an inability to keep anything down 
Fever, with a temperature higher than F C 
If these signs and symptoms occur, stop having sex and see your provider soon 
Prompt treatment of an sexually transmitted infection STI can help prevent PID 
This can happen during menstruation and after childbirth, miscarriage or abortion 
Being in a sexual relationship with someone who has more than one sex partner 
Having a history of pelvic inflammatory disease or a sexually transmitted infection 
This risk is generally confined to the first three weeks after insertion 
Ectopic pregnancies can cause massive, life threatening bleeding and require emergency medical attention 
Damage to your reproductive organs may cause infertility the inability to become pregnant 
The more times you ve had PID, the greater your risk of infertility 
Delaying treatment for PID also dramatically increases your risk of infertility 
Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause pelvic pain that might last for months or years 
If an abscess is left untreated, you could develop a life threatening infection 
Many forms of contraception do not protect against the development of PID 
Using barrier methods, such as a condom, helps to reduce your risk 
If you re at risk of an STI, make an appointment with your provider for testing 
Set up a regular screening schedule with your provider if needed 
Early treatment of an STI gives you the best chance of avoiding PID 
This can prevent the spread of STIs and possible recurrence of PID 
Overview Pelvic organ prolapse is when one or more pelvic organs drop from their position 
This makes a bulge in the vagina, called a prolapse 
Pelvic organs include the vagina, bladder, uterus, urethra and rectum 
Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles and tissues of the pelvic floor weaken 
Sometimes, surgery might be needed to put the pelvic organs back in place 
Seeing or feeling a bulge of tissue at or beyond the opening of the vagina 
Weakness of the pelvic floor often affects more than one area 
Risk factors Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include 
Having more than one baby, vaginal delivery, high birth weight babies and deliveries using tools 
Having a family history of pelvic organ prolapse or connective tissue conditions 
As a result, the uterus slips down into or protrudes out of the vagina 
Uterine prolapse most often affects people after menopause who ve had one or more vaginal deliveries 
But uterine prolapse that causes discomfort or disrupts daily life might benefit from treatment 
Feeling like the bladder doesn t empty all the way when you use the bathroom 
Feeling as if you have vaginal tissue rubbing on clothing 
Sexual concerns, such as feeling as though the vaginal tissue is loose 
Causes Uterine prolapse results from the weakening of pelvic muscles and supportive tissues 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of uterine prolapse include 
Complications Uterine prolapse often happens with prolapse of other pelvic organs 
Anterior prolapse results from weak connective tissue between the bladder and roof of the vagina 
It can cause the bladder to bulge into the vagina 
Drink plenty of fluids and eat high fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains 
If you have to lift something heavy, do it correctly 
Correct lifting uses the legs instead of the waist or back 
The blisters rupture easily, leaving open sores, which may ooze and become infected 
The signs and symptoms of two common types of pemphigus are as follows 
Blisters in your mouth or throat may make it hard to swallow and eat 
This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders 
Normally, your immune system produces antibodies to fight off harmful invaders, such viruses and bacteria 
Rarely, pemphigus is triggered by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, penicillamine and other drugs 
Risk factors Your risk of pemphigus increases if you re middle aged or older 
The condition tends to be more common in people of Middle Eastern or Jewish descent 
Malnutrition, because painful mouth sores make it difficult to eat 
Medication side effects, such as high blood pressure and infection 
The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain 
Gastric ulcers that occur on the inside of the stomach 
The most common peptic ulcer symptom is burning stomach pain 
Stomach acid makes the pain worse, as does having an empty stomach 
The pain may be worse between meals and at night 
Less often, ulcers may cause severe signs or symptoms such as 
Vomiting or vomiting blood which may appear red or black 
Dark blood in stools, or stools that are black or tarry 
The acid can create a painful open sore that may bleed 
Your digestive tract is coated with a mucous layer that normally protects against acid 
It may be transmitted from person to person by close contact, such as kissing 
People may also contract H pylori through food and water 
Severe blood loss may cause black or bloody vomit or black or bloody stools 
But some women notice changes as early as their mid s 
You may also experience menopause like symptoms, such as hot flashes, sleep problems and vaginal dryness 
Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause 
The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes 
When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful 
Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections 
However, as long as you re having periods, pregnancy is still possible 
When to see a doctorSome women seek medical attention for their perimenopausal symptoms 
Many of the changes you experience during perimenopause are a result of decreasing estrogen 
Risk factors Menopause is a normal phase in life 
But it may occur earlier in some women than in others 
Women with a family history of early menopause may experience early menopause themselves 
Treatment for cancer with chemotherapy or pelvic radiation therapy has been linked to early menopause 
A hysterectomy that removes your uterus, but not your ovaries, usually doesn t cause menopause 
Although you no longer have periods, your ovaries still produce estrogen 
But such surgery may cause menopause to occur earlier than average 
Most of the time this is normal and nothing to be concerned about 
Peripheral nerves are made of fibers called axons that are insulated by surrounding tissues 
A nerve injury can affect the brain s ability to communicate with muscles and organs 
It s important to get medical care for a peripheral nerve injury as soon as possible 
Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications and permanent damage 
Your symptoms often depend on which nerve fibers are damaged 
These include numbness or tingling in the hands or feet 
Medical conditions, such as diabetes, Guillain Barre syndrome and carpal tunnel syndrome 
Other causes include narrowing of the arteries, hormonal imbalances and tumors 
Overview Peripheral nerve tumors are growths that form in or near nerves 
Weakness or a loss of function in the affected area 
Causes It s not clear why most peripheral nerve tumors develop 
Risk factors Peripheral nerve tumors are more common in people who have 
In these disorders, tumors develop on or near the nerves throughout the body 
Overview Peritonitis is a serious condition that starts in the abdomen 
That s the area of the body between the chest and the pelvis 
Peritonitis happens when the thin layer of tissue inside the abdomen becomes inflamed 
Peritonitis usually happens due to an infection from bacteria or fungi 
It can happen when someone has liver disease, such as cirrhosis, or kidney disease 
Health care providers have ways to clear out the infection 
They also can treat any medical problem that might be causing it 
Peritonitis treatment usually involves medicines that are used for infections caused by bacteria, called antibiotics 
A common cause of peritonitis is a treatment for kidney failure called peritoneal dialysis 
For example, it s important to wash your hands and clean the skin around your catheter 
If you get peritoneal dialysis, peritonitis symptoms also may include 
White flecks, strands or clumps which are called fibrin in the dialysis fluid 
When to see a doctorPeritonitis can be life threatening if you don t get treatment quickly 
Smells unusual, especially if the area around your catheter is changes color or is painful 
Peritonitis also might happen after a burst appendix or a serious injury to your abdomen 
Get medical help right away if you have severe belly pain 
It may feel so bad that you can t sit still or find a comfortable position 
Common causes of a hole that leads to peritonitis include 
Peritoneal dialysis uses tubes, also called catheters, to remove waste products from the blood 
Peritonitis can happen after a procedure to check the digestive tract called endoscopy 
A ruptured appendix, stomach ulcer or hole in the colon 
This is inflammation of a gland in the abdomen called the pancreas 
If you have pancreatitis and you get an infection, bacteria could spread outside the pancreas 
Infection of small, bulging pouches in the digestive tract may cause peritonitis 
This could happen if one of the pouches breaks open 
The burst pouch could spill waste from the intestine into the abdomen 
Peritonitis that happens without a hole or tear is called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 
It s usually a complication of liver disease, such as cirrhosis 
Advanced cirrhosis causes a lot of fluid buildup in your abdomen 
Risk factors Some things that raise the risk of peritonitis are 
Certain conditions raise your risk of getting peritonitis, such as 
Complications Without treatment, peritonitis may cause a whole body infection called sepsis 
PreventionPeritonitis that s linked with peritoneal dialysis is often caused by germs around the catheter 
If you use peritoneal dialysis, take these steps to prevent peritonitis 
Clean the skin around the catheter with an antiseptic every day 
Talk with your dialysis care team about the correct care for your peritoneal dialysis catheter 
These symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, and problems with concentration and memory 
A mild traumatic brain injury is known as a concussion 
You don t have to lose consciousness to get a concussion or experience persistent post concussive symptoms 
But sometimes they can last for a year or more 
Headaches after a concussion most often feel like tension type headaches 
If a concussion occurs while playing a sport, don t go back into the game 
Seek medical attention so that the injury doesn t become worse 
Persistent post concussive symptoms may develop as a result of the impact of the injury itself 
Or persistent post concussive symptoms may trigger other conditions such as migraines 
Risk factors Risk factors for developing persistent post concussive symptoms include 
Studies that increasing age is a risk factor for persistent post concussive symptoms 
Fasten your seat belt whenever you re traveling in a car 
It s very hard for the person to express a full range of emotions 
You may not be interested in or able to form close friendships or romantic relationships 
SymptomsIf you have schizoid personality disorder, it s likely that you 
May lack the drive that makes you want to reach goals 
Schizoid personality disorder most often begins when a person is a young adult 
In contrast to schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia, people with schizoid personality disorder 
Are not likely to feel paranoid, hold bizarre beliefs or hallucinate 
You can offer to go along to the first appointment 
Causes Personality is the blend of thoughts, emotions and behaviors that makes you special 
It s the way you view, understand and relate to the outside world 
It s shaped through a blend of your surroundings and genes passed down from your parents 
Children typically learn over time to properly understand social cues and take action 
What causes schizoid personality disorder to happen is not known 
Risk factors Factors that raise your risk of schizoid personality disorder include 
Complications People with schizoid personality disorder are at higher risk of 
They generally don t understand how relationships form or the impact of their behavior on others 
They may also misinterpret others motivations and behaviors and develop significant distrust of others 
SymptomsSchizotypal personality disorder typically includes five or more of these signs and symptoms 
Being a loner and lacking close friends outside of the immediate family 
Suspicious or paranoid thoughts and constant doubts about the loyalty of others 
Belief in special powers, such as mental telepathy or superstitions 
Unusual perceptions, such as sensing an absent person s presence or having illusions 
Dressing in peculiar ways, such as appearing unkempt or wearing oddly matched clothes 
Those with schizophrenia generally can t be swayed away from their delusions 
Or people with schizotypal personality disorder may seek help for another problem such as depression 
Causes Personality is the combination of thoughts, emotions and behaviors that makes you unique 
Personality forms during childhood, shaped through an interaction of inherited tendencies and environmental factors 
Complications People with schizotypal personality disorder are at an increased risk of 
Overview People have unique personalities made up of a complex combination of different traits 
Genes Your parents may pass down some personality traits to you 
People with personality disorders often have a hard time understanding emotions and tolerating distress 
SymptomsIn some cases, you may not know that you have a personality disorder 
That s because how you think and behave seems natural to you 
You also may think others are responsible for your challenges 
There are many types of personality disorders, each with important differences 
These disorders are organized into three groups, or clusters, with shared features and symptoms 
Lacks trust and is suspicious of others and the reasons for their actions 
Believes that others are trying to do harm with no reason to feel this way 
Hesitates to confide in others for fear that others will use that information against them 
Takes innocent remarks or situations that are not threatening as personal insults or attacks 
Becomes angry or hostile to what are believed to be slights or insults 
Appears to be cold to or not interested in others 
Has little to no interest in having sex with another person 
Feels or thinks strange things, such as hearing a voice whisper their name

Has little, if any, concern for the needs or feelings of others 
Has little, if any, concern for personal safety or the safety of others 
Has little, if any, regret for how their behavior negatively affects others 
C personality disorders have a consistently dysfunctional pattern of anxious thinking or behavior 
Does not take part in work activities that include contact with others 
Does not try new activities and does not like meeting new people 
Is extremely shy in social settings and in dealing with others 
Relies on others too much and feels the need to be taken care of 
Fears having to take care of self if left alone 
Needs a lot of advice and comforting from others to make even small decisions 
Finds it hard to start or do projects due to lack of self confidence 
Finds it hard to disagree with others, fearing they will not approve 
Endures poor treatment or abuse, even when other options are available 
Has an urgent need to start a new relationship when a close one ends 
Thinks everything needs to be perfect and gets upset when perfection is not achieved 
Cannot finish a project because reaching perfection is not possible 
Needs to be in control of people, tasks and situations 
Ignores friends and enjoyable activities because of too much focus on work or a project 
Obsessive compulsive personality disorder is not the same as obsessive compulsive disorder, which is an anxiety disorder 
When personality disorders are not treated, they can cause serious issues in relationships and mood 
Also, the ability to function and pursue personal goals may get worse without treatment 
This includes a home environment that is not stable, predictable or supportive 
Whooping cough Overview Whooping cough pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection 
Before the vaccine was developed, whooping cough was considered a childhood disease 
Deaths associated with whooping cough are rare but most commonly occur in infants 
They re usually mild at first and resemble those of a common cold 
End with a high pitched whoop sound during the next breath of air 
Instead, they may struggle to breathe, or they may even temporarily stop breathing 
Seem to be struggling to breathe or have noticeable pauses in breathing 
Causes Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis 
Risk factors The whooping cough vaccine you receive as a child eventually wears off 
Complications Teens and adults often recover from whooping cough with no problems 
When complications occur, they tend to be side effects of the strenuous coughing, such as 
Broken blood vessels in the skin or the whites of your eyes 
Complications can be life threatening for infants younger than months old 
This vaccine will also reduce the risk of your transmitting whooping cough to infants 
A sore throat caused by a virus resolves on its own 
Other less common causes of sore throat might require more complex treatment 
SymptomsSymptoms of a sore throat can vary depending on the cause 
Infections causing a sore throat might result in other signs and symptoms, including 
Get immediate care if your child has severe signs and symptoms such as 
A sore throat that is severe or lasts longer than a week 
Causes Viruses that cause the common cold and the flu also cause most sore throats 
Croup a common childhood illness characterized by a harsh, barking cough 
The most common is Streptococcus pyogenes group A streptococcus which causes strep throat 
Allergies to pet dander, molds, dust and pollen can cause a sore throat 
The problem may be complicated by postnasal drip, which can irritate and inflame the throat 
Dry indoor air can make your throat feel rough and scratchy 
Chewing tobacco, drinking alcohol and eating spicy foods also can irritate your throat 
Cancerous tumors of the throat, tongue or voice box larynx can cause a sore throat 
Children and teens are most likely to develop sore throats 
Drainage from your nose can irritate your throat or spread infection 
You re more susceptible to infections in general if your resistance is low 
Follow these tips and teach your child to do the same 
Cough or sneeze into a tissue and throw it away, and then wash your hands 
Avoid touching public phones or drinking fountains with your mouth 
Regularly clean and disinfect phones, doorknobs, light switches, remotes and computer keyboards 
When you travel, clean phones, light switches and remotes in your hotel room 
Avoid close contact with people who are sick or have symptoms 
PKU is caused by a change in the phenylalanine hydroxylase PAH gene 
This gene helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine 
However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs of PKU within a few months 
Signs and symptoms of untreated PKU can be mild or severe and may include 
The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU 
The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced 
This results in high levels of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage 
Babies born to women with high phenylalanine levels don t often inherit PKU 
When to see a doctorTalk to your health care provider in these situations 
This reduces the risk of high blood phenylalanine levels harming their unborn babies 
Causes A gene change genetic mutation causes PKU, which can be mild, moderate or severe 
Risk factors Risk factors for inheriting PKU include 
Having both parents with a gene change that causes PKU 
Complications Untreated PKU can lead to complications in infants, children and adults with the disorder 
Irreversible brain damage and marked intellectual disability beginning within the first few months of life 
Behavioral, emotional and social problems in older children and adults 
Nutritional supplements designed for people with PKU can ensure enough protein and nutrition during pregnancy 
Overview A pheochromocytoma fee o kroe moe sy TOE muh is a rare tumor that grows in an adrenal gland 
You have two adrenal glands one at the top of each kidney 
With a pheochromocytoma, the tumor releases hormones that can cause various symptoms 
They include high blood pressure, headache, sweating and symptoms of a panic attack 
If a pheochromocytoma isn t treated, serious or life threatening damage to other body systems can happen 
Surgery to remove a pheochromocytoma often returns blood pressure to a healthy range 
They don t realize they have the tumor until an imaging test happens to find it 
Symptom spellsMost often, the symptoms of pheochromocytoma come and go 
When they start suddenly and keep coming back, they re known as spells or attacks 
These spells may or may not have a trigger that can be found 
Certain activities or conditions can lead to a spell, such as 
Foods high in tyramine, a substance that affects blood pressure, also can trigger spells 
Tyramine is common in foods that are fermented, aged, pickled, cured, overripe or spoiled 
Some examples of tricyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline and desipramine Norpramin 
But most people who have high blood pressure don t have an adrenal tumor 
Talk to your healthcare professional if any of these factors apply to you 
Spells of symptoms linked with pheochromocytoma, such as headaches, sweating and a fast, pounding heartbeat 
High blood pressure that starts before the age of 
These cells are located in the center of an adrenal gland 
That response happens when the body thinks there is a threat 
The hormones cause blood pressure to rise and the heart to beat faster 
They also prepare other body systems so you can react quickly 
A pheochromocytoma causes more of these hormones to be released 
And it causes them to be released when you re not in a threatening situation 
Most of the chromaffin cells are in the adrenal glands 
Chromaffin cell tumors located outside of the adrenal glands are called paragangliomas 
They may cause the same effects on the body as a pheochromocytoma 
Most pheochromocytomas are found in people between the ages of and 
People who have certain rare genetic conditions have a higher risk of pheochromocytomas 
The tumors can be benign, meaning they are not cancer 
Often, benign tumors related to these genetic conditions form in both adrenal glands 
Other tumors linked with this condition can appear in other parts of the body 
These body parts include the thyroid, parathyroid glands, lips, mouth and digestive system 
This condition can cause tumors in many parts of the body 
Possible sites include the brain and spinal cord, endocrine system, pancreas and kidneys 
In superficial thrombophlebitis, the vein is near the surface of the skin 
In deep vein thrombosis or DVT, the vein is deep within a muscle 
Both types of thrombophlebitis can be treated with blood thinning medications 
Causes of thrombophlebitis include trauma, surgery or prolonged inactivity 
Deep vein thrombosis DVT increases the risk of serious health problems 
Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include swelling, tenderness, and pain in your leg 
Have someone take you to your doctor or emergency room, if possible 
Being immobile for long periods, such as during an injury or a hospital stay 
Having varicose veins or a pacemaker can also increase your risk 
Have varicose veins, which are a common cause of superficial thrombophlebitis 
Have a family history of a blood clotting disorder or a tendency to form blood clots 
However, if you develop deep vein thrombosis DVT , the risk of serious complications increases 
If you re driving, stop every hour or so and move around 
Drink plenty of water or other nonalcoholic fluids to avoid dehydration 
In these instances, your child s health care provider may recommend an imaging test 
If a spinal problem is found, treatment depends on the underlying cause 
SymptomsA sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back 
It s usually located just above the crease between the buttocks 
Causes There are no known causes for a sacral dimple 
It is a congenital condition, meaning it s present at birth 
In most cases, spina bifida occulta causes no symptoms and doesn t need treatment 
The spinal cord normally hangs freely within the spinal canal 
A pinched nerve can occur in many areas of the body 
This may cause pain that radiates down the back of the leg 
Sometimes, surgery is needed to relieve pain from a pinched nerve 
Numbness or less feeling in the area supplied by the nerve 
Often feeling as if a foot or hand has fallen asleep 
Symptoms related to a pinched nerve may be worse when you re sleeping 
See your healthcare professional if symptoms last for several days and don t respond to self care 
A number of conditions may cause tissue to compress a nerve or nerves, including 
If a nerve is pinched for only a short time, there s often no permanent damage 
However, if the pressure continues, chronic pain and permanent nerve damage can occur 
Risk factors The following factors may increase your risk of experiencing a pinched nerve 
Trauma or a condition that causes bone thickening, such as osteoarthritis, can cause bone spurs 
Inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis can compress nerves, especially in your joints 
People with thyroid disease are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome 
People with diabetes are at higher risk of nerve compression 
Water and weight gain associated with pregnancy can swell nerve pathways, compressing your nerves 
Long periods of lying down can increase the risk of nerve compression 
PreventionThe following measures may help you prevent a pinched nerve 
Don t cross your legs or lie in any one position for a long time 
Incorporate strength and flexibility exercises into your regular exercise program 
Limit repetitive activities and take frequent breaks when engaging in these activities 
Maintain a healthy weight to put less pressure on nerves 
PineoblastomaPineoblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the brain s pineal gland 
Melatonin plays a role in the body s natural sleep wake cycle 
Pineoblastoma begins as a growth of cells in the pineal gland 
The cells grow quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue 
Pineoblastoma may cause headaches, sleepiness and changes in the way the eyes move 
It can spread within the brain and into the fluid around the brain 
Treatment usually involves surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible 
Imaging tests can find the location and size of the brain tumor 
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is often used to diagnose brain tumors 
Additional tests might include computerized tomography CT and positron emission tomography PET scans 
This helps determine the types of cells and how quickly they are growing 
The health care provider inserts a needle between two bones in the lower spine 
The needle is used to take cerebrospinal fluid from around the spinal cord 
Cerebrospinal fluid may also be collected during a biopsy to remove tissue from the brain 
A pineoblastoma may be big enough to block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid 
An operation can redirect the fluid through a drain or tube 
This is because pineoblastoma forms near important structures deep inside the brain 
These beams can come from X rays, protons or other sources 
During radiation therapy, a machine directs beams to the brain and spinal cord 
Radiation is often given to the entire brain and spinal cord 
This treatment is often recommended for adults and children older than 
Sometimes it s used at the same time as radiation therapy 
This might shrink the cancer and make it easier to remove 
Stereotactic radiosurgery focuses multiple beams of radiation on exact points to kill cancer cells 
Causes Accidentally swallowing or breathing in pinworm eggs causes a pinworm infection 
The eggs then get transferred to other surfaces, such as toys, bedding or toilet seats 
Pinworm eggs can survive for two to three weeks on surfaces 
Risk factors Risk factors for pinworm infection include 
Pinworm infections are most likely to occur in children ages to 
Pinworm infections are uncommon in children younger than age 
People who live in institutions are at higher risk of developing pinworm infections 
In rare circumstances, heavy infestations can cause infection of female genitals 
Wash bedsheets, pajamas, underwear, washcloths and towels in hot water to help kill pinworm eggs 
Trim your child s fingernails so there s less space for eggs to collect 
Suggest that your child avoid biting his or her nails 
Overview Pituitary tumors are unusual growths that develop in the pituitary gland 
This gland is an organ about the size of a pea 
It s located behind the nose at the base of the brain 
Others can cause the pituitary gland to make too little of those hormones 
They typically don t spread to other parts of the body 
Or its growth may be controlled with medications or radiation therapy 
Your health care provider may suggest a combination of these treatments 
They cause different symptoms depending on the kind of hormones they make 
Functioning pituitary adenomas fall into several categories, including those that make 
Pituitary tumors that make these hormones are called gonadotroph adenomas 
A cyst is a sac that may be filled with air, fluid or other material 
A tumor is an unusual mass of cells that may grow over time 
If they don t cause symptoms, pituitary tumors usually don t need treatment 
Pain in the face, sometimes including sinus pain or ear pain 
Macroadenomas can limit the pituitary gland s ability to make hormones 
Sexual problems, such as problems with erections and less interest in sex 
Functioning pituitary adenomas typically make a large amount of one hormone 
That exposes the body to high levels of that hormone 
Rarely, a pituitary adenoma may make more than one hormone 
Pituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone are called corticotroph adenomas 
Adrenocorticotropic hormone, also called ACTH, causes the adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol 
ACTH tumors trigger the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol 
Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits around the midsection and upper back 
Sexual problems, including problems with erections and less interest in sex 
Pituitary tumors that make growth hormone also are called growth hormone secreting tumors or somatotroph adenomas 
Too much growth hormone leads to a condition known as acromegaly 
Luteinizing hormone LH and follicle stimulating hormone FSH are also known as gonadotropins 
It s uncommon for these adenomas to make too many hormones that then trigger symptoms 
Instead, symptoms from these adenomas usually are due to tumor pressure 
Enlargement of and pain in the ovaries caused by a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
In men, too much prolactin can cause a condition called male hypogonadism 
Pituitary tumors that make thyroid stimulating hormone are called thyrotroph adenomas 
They also may be referred to as thyroid stimulating hormone secreting tumors 
That leads to a condition called hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid disease 
Hyperthyroidism can speed up the body s metabolism causing many symptoms 
Causes The pituitary gland is a small organ about the size of a pea 
The hormones it makes control important body functions, such as growth, blood pressure and reproduction 
In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be caused by genes you ve inherited 
Complications Pituitary tumors usually don t spread to other parts of the body 
This type of seizure is known as a focal seizure with impaired awareness 
These seizures involve a change in or loss of consciousness or awareness 
If you have one of these seizures, you may seem to be awake 
As a result, you may need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life 
Pituitary apoplexyA rare but potentially serious complication of a pituitary tumor is pituitary apoplexy 
This happens when there is sudden bleeding into the tumor 
A severe headache, likely worse than you ve ever had before 
The treatment usually includes taking corticosteroid medicine to ease swelling around the tumor 
It tends to go away on its own within weeks 
The rash persists for several weeks and heals without scarring 
Medicated lotions may lessen itchiness and speed the disappearance of the rash 
Before the herald patch appears, some people have headache, fatigue, fever or sore throat 
But it s not related to the herpes virus that causes cold sores 
Tinea versicolor Overview Tinea versicolor is a common fungal infection of the skin 
The fungus interferes with the normal pigmentation of the skin, resulting in small, discolored patches 
Tinea versicolor TIN ee uh vur si KUL ur occurs most frequently in teens and young adults 
Tinea versicolor, which is also called pityriasis versicolor, is not painful or contagious 
Antifungal creams, lotions or shampoos can help treat tinea versicolor 
But even after successful treatment, skin color may remain uneven for several weeks or months 
Causes The fungus that causes tinea versicolor can be found on healthy skin 
You may need to use these just during warm and humid months 
The cysts vary in size, and they can grow very large 
Having many cysts or large cysts can damage your kidneys 
The disease can cause serious complications, including high blood pressure and kidney failure 
PKD varies greatly in its severity, and some complications are preventable 
Lifestyle changes and treatments might help reduce damage to your kidneys from complications 
The two main types of polycystic kidney disease, caused by different genetic flaws, are 
Signs and symptoms of ADPKD often develop between the ages of and 
Only one parent needs to have the disease for it to pass to the children 
If one parent has ADPKD, each child has a chance of getting the disease 
This form accounts for most of the cases of polycystic kidney disease 
Sometimes, symptoms don t appear until later in childhood or during adolescence 
Both parents must have abnormal genes to pass on this form of the disease 
Complications Complications associated with polycystic kidney disease include 
Elevated blood pressure is a common complication of polycystic kidney disease 
Nearly half of those with the disease have kidney failure by age 
Pain is a common symptom for people with polycystic kidney disease 
The likelihood of developing liver cysts for someone with polycystic kidney disease increases with age 
While both men and women develop cysts, women often develop larger cysts 
Female hormones and multiple pregnancies might contribute to liver cyst development 
People with polycystic kidney disease have a higher risk of aneurysms 
People with a family history of aneurysms seem to be at highest risk 
Ask your doctor if screening is needed in your case 
Pregnancy is successful for most women with polycystic kidney disease 
In some cases, however, women may develop a life threatening disorder called preeclampsia 
As many as in adults with polycystic kidney disease develops mitral valve prolapse 
Here are some tips for keeping your blood pressure in check 
Take the blood pressure medications prescribed by your doctor as directed 
Eat a low salt diet containing plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
Ask your doctor what the right weight is for you 
Aim for at least minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week 
Typically, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall after childbirth 
With placenta accreta, part or all of the placenta remains attached 
Sometimes, however, placenta accreta occurs without a history of uterine surgery 
Risk factors Many factors can increase the risk of placenta accreta, including 
Placenta accreta is more common in women older than 
The risk of placenta accreta increases as your number of pregnancies increases 
Placenta accreta poses a major risk of severe vaginal bleeding hemorrhage after delivery 
It works to provide oxygen and nutrition to the baby and to remove waste 
The placenta connects to your baby through the umbilical cord 
With placenta previa, the placenta attaches lower in the uterus 
This results in some portion of the placental tissue covering the cervix 
It can result in bleeding during the pregnancy or during or after delivery 
Sometimes, spotting happens before an event with more blood loss 
The bleeding may occur with prelabor contractions of the uterus that cause pain 
The bleeding may also be triggered by sex or during a medical exam 
Often there is no clear event that leads to bleeding 
Risk factors Placenta previa is more common among women who 
Have scars on the uterus from a previous surgery or procedure 
Are pregnant after having an assisted reproductive technology ART procedure for treating infertility 
Severe bleeding may prompt an emergency C section before your baby is full term 
Placenta previa is associated with a group of conditions called placenta accreta spectrum 
With these conditions, the placenta grows into or through the wall of the uterus 
Placenta accreta has a high risk of bleeding during pregnancy or during and after delivery 
Placental abruption Overview Placental abruption abruptio placentae is an uncommon yet serious complication of pregnancy 
Left untreated, it endangers both the mother and the baby 
Placental abruption in a previous pregnancy that wasn t caused by abdominal trauma 
Hypertension related problems during pregnancy, including preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome or eclampsia 
A fall or other type of blow to the abdomen 
Early rupture of membranes, which causes leaking amniotic fluid before the end of pregnancy 
Complications Placental abruption can cause life threatening problems for both mother and baby 
Failure of the kidneys or other organs resulting from blood loss 
Rarely, the need for hysterectomy, if uterine bleeding can t be controlled 
PreventionYou can t prevent placental abruption, but you can decrease certain risk factors 
For example, don t smoke or use illegal drugs, such as cocaine 
Overview Plague is a serious illness caused by a germ called Yersinia pestis 
The germs mostly live in small rodents and their fleas 
The most common way for humans to get plague is a flea bite 
The illness mostly occurs in only a few countries around the world 
These are small, bean shaped filters in the body s immune system 
The word bubonic is describing this feature of the disease 
If a person has bubonic plague, buboes appear in the armpits, groin or neck 
Septicemic plagueSepticemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream 
More serious symptoms may develop with advanced disease and organ failure 
Bleeding from the mouth, nose or rectum, or under the skin 
Signs of shock, such as seizure, rash and low blood pressure 
Symptoms can begin within a few hours after exposure and worsen rapidly 
When to see a doctorGet immediate care if you have a sudden high fever 
The countries with frequent cases include Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru 
Causes Plague is caused by a bacteria called Yersinia pestis 
The bacteria circulate in populations of small animals and their fleas 
Disease in humansPeople are most likely to get plague from a flea bite 
The fleas are likely to come from small wild animals or from pets 
People also can get plague from direct contact with tissues of a sick animal 
Pneumonic plague can be passed from animals to humans, or from humans to humans 
People can become infected when they inhale the droplets or touch coughed up mucus 
Risk factors The risk of getting plague is very low 
Worldwide, only a few thousand people get plague each year 
In the United States, seven people on average get plague each year 
LocationPlague has been reported in nearly all parts of the world 
The most common locations are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru 
In Madagascar there is usually an outbreak of plague every year 
It also has occurred in cities with overcrowding, poor sanitation or large rat populations 
Evidence exists of it being used or developed as a weapon in the past 
The U S government has guidelines for treatment and prevention of plague used as a weapon 
Most people with bubonic plague survive with prompt diagnosis and treatment 
Risk of death is high if treatment doesn t begin within hours after symptoms start 
PreventionNo vaccine is available, but scientists are working to develop one 
Antibiotics can help prevent infection if you were likely exposed to plague 
People with pneumonic plague are isolated during treatment to prevent the spread of disease 
Reducing the risk of exposureIf you live or spend time outdoors where plague occurs 
Remove nesting areas for rodents, such as piles of brush, rock, firewood and junk 
Don t leave pet food in areas that rodents can easily access 
If you become aware of rodents living in your home, take steps to remove them 
Don t let pets sleep with you if they are outside in areas where plague occurs 
When handling dead animals, wear gloves to prevent contact between your skin and the animal 
When outdoors, use insect repellents registered with the U S Environmental Protection Agency 
Do not use insect repellent on a child under months old 
Overview Plantar warts are small, rough growths on the feet 
This virus enters through tiny cuts or breaks on the bottom of the feet 
On brown and Black skin, the growth may be lighter than unaffected skin 
Black pinpoints, which are small clotted blood vessels commonly called wart seeds 
A cluster of growths on the sole of the foot mosaic warts 
A growth that interrupts the normal lines and ridges in the skin of your foot 
The growth is bleeding, painful or changes in shape or color 
You also have diabetes or poor feeling in your feet 
HPV is very common, and more than kinds of the virus exist 
But only a few of them cause warts on the feet 
Transmission of the virusEach person s immune system responds differently to HPV 
Not everyone who comes in contact with it develops warts 
Even people in the same family react to the virus differently 
The HPV strains that cause plantar warts aren t highly contagious 
So the virus isn t easily spread by direct contact from one person to another 
If the virus spreads from the first site of infection, more warts may grow 
Also called pleuritis, pleurisy causes sharp chest pain pleuritic pain that worsens during breathing 
One pleural layer of tissue wraps around the outside of the lungs 
If you have pleurisy, these tissues swell and become inflamed 
The pleuritic pain lessens or stops when you hold your breath 
Treatment of pleurisy involves pain control and treating the cause 
Chest pain that worsens when you breathe, cough or sneeze 
Shortness of breath often from trying to limit breathing in and out 
Pleurisy can occur along with pleural effusion, atelectasis or empyema 
A large amount of fluid in the pleural space can create pressure 
This can compress your lung to the point that it partially or completely collapses atelectasis 
And taking certain medicines or certain recreational drugs raise the risk of pleurisy 
Overview Primary lateral sclerosis PLS is a type of motor neuron disease 
A motor neuron disease affects the nerve cells in the brain that control movement 
Less commonly, the condition may begin with problems with speaking and swallowing 
While likely related to ALS, PLS gets worse more slowly than ALS 
SymptomsSymptoms of primary lateral sclerosis usually take years to develop and get worse 
Rarely, PLS begins with weakness in the tongue or hands 
Then weakness gradually moves down the spinal cord to the legs 
A hoarse voice, as well as slowed, slurred speech and drooling 
Rarely, breathing problems and bladder problems late in the disease 
Also see a health care professional if you have trouble swallowing or speaking 
People with PLS may have problems with balance, weakness, slowed movement and clumsiness 
Adult onset primary lateral sclerosisThe cause of PLS that begins in adulthood is not known 
Juvenile primary lateral sclerosisJuvenile PLS is caused by changes in a gene called ALS 
But they know that the ALS gene gives instructions for creating a protein called alsin 
Risk factors There are no established environmental risk factors for primary lateral sclerosis 
For most people, adult onset PLS isn t thought to shorten life expectancy 
But it can gradually affect the quality of your life as more muscles become disabled 
Weaker muscles can cause you to fall, which can result in injuries 
Problems with chewing and swallowing may result in poor nutrition 
Performing activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing, may become hard 
People with PLS may develop problems with their thinking, known as cognitive decline 
For some people, their symptoms overlap with symptoms of frontotemporal dementia 
Overview Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs 
A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia 
Confusion or changes in mental awareness in adults age and older 
Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection 
It s especially important that people in these high risk groups see a doctor 
People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system 
People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system 
The most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe 
Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs 
It occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities 
The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U S is Streptococcus pneumoniae 
It may affect one part lobe of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia 
It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia 
Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia 
Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than years 
Coronavirus COVID may cause pneumonia, which can become severe 
Some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness 
Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into your lungs 
Smoking damages your body s natural defenses against the bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia 
An abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung 
Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia and the flu 
Children who attend a group child care center should also get the vaccine 
Doctors also recommend flu shots for children older than months 
Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet 
Overview Pneumonitis noo moe NIE tis is a general term that refers to inflammation of lung tissue 
Technically, pneumonia is a type of pneumonitis because the infection causes inflammation 
Pneumonitis, however, is usually used by doctors to refer to noninfectious causes of lung inflammation 
Common causes of pneumonitis include airborne irritants at your job or from your hobbies 
In addition, some types of cancer treatments and dozens of drugs can cause pneumonitis 
Call your doctor anytime you have difficulty breathing, no matter what might be the cause 
This inflammation makes it difficult for oxygen to pass through the alveoli into the bloodstream 
Many irritants, ranging from airborne molds to chemotherapy drugs, have been linked to pneumonitis 
But for most people, the specific substance causing the inflammation is never identified 
Repeated exposure to some molds and bacteria can cause the lungs to become inflamed 
Exposure to feathers or bird excrement is a common cause of pneumonitis 
Some occupations and hobbies carry higher risks of pneumonitis, including 
Many types of farming operations expose workers to aerosolized mists and pesticides 
Mold particles also can be inhaled during harvests of grain and hay 
Some chemotherapy drugs can cause pneumonitis, as can radiation therapy to the lungs 
The combination of the two increases the risk of irreversible lung disease 
Complications Pneumonitis that goes unnoticed or untreated can cause irreversible lung damage 
In normal lungs, the air sacs stretch and relax with each breath 
In severe cases, pulmonary fibrosis can cause right heart failure, respiratory failure and death 
This is an essential feature in the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome 
Monoclonal protein is often associated with unusual bone hardening or thickening 
But people with POEMS syndrome have an increased number of plasma cells 
POEMS syndrome can be misdiagnosed because the signs and symptoms mimic those of other disorders 
POEMS syndrome progresses rapidly without treatment and can become life threatening, so early diagnosis is important 
Treatment for POEMS syndrome might improve your symptoms but doesn t cure the condition 
Treatment options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy and stem cell transplant 
Washing off the oil may reduce your chances of getting a poison ivy rash 
If you develop a rash, it can be very itchy and last for weeks 
Difficulty breathing, if you ve inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy 
You can also transfer the oil to other parts of your body with your fingers 
You inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy and are having difficulty breathing 
You develop a fever greater than F C 
It s found in poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac 
You might then transfer it to your face or body by touching or rubbing 
Pus that oozes from blisters doesn t contain urushiol and won t spread the rash 
See your doctor if pus starts oozing from the blisters 
Learn how to identify poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac in all seasons 
If camping, make sure you pitch your tent in an area free of these plants 
If needed, protect your skin by wearing socks, boots, pants, long sleeves and heavy gloves 
Identify and remove poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac from your yard or garden 
Afterward remove the gloves carefully and wash them and your hands 
Even washing after an hour or so can help reduce the severity of the rash 
It can also lead to trouble breathing and sometimes death 
But poliovirus still spreads within areas with low vaccination rates 
SymptomsMost people infected with the virus that causes polio, called poliovirus, don t get symptoms 
This leads to flu like symptoms that last to days 
While the illness lasts longer than a few days, it doesn t cause paralysis 
Besides having more severe flu like symptoms, nonparalytic polio symptoms may include 
Paralytic polioThis most serious form of the disease is rare 
But paralysis of one leg is most common, followed by paralysis of one arm 
Depending on the severity of disease, other signs or symptoms may include 
Even though the weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn t cause illness, it can spread 
Infections from VDPV have been reported in the United States 
Samples from wastewater showed that VDPV was spreading in some communities 
The virus also may be in water contaminated with feces carrying the poliovirus 
But anyone who hasn t been vaccinated is at risk of getting the disease 
Complications Severe disease that affects the ability to breathe can cause death 
vaccineThe CDC recommends four doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine IPV at the following ages 
Between ages and when children are just entering school 
Adult vaccinationIn the U S , most adults have immunity to the poliovirus because of childhood vaccination 
And U S adults have little chance of being exposed to the virus 
If you had a complete course of vaccination, you should get a one time IPV booster 
Then the third dose is to months after the second dose 
Talk to your health care provider if you know you have an incomplete vaccination history 
Common side effects are pain and redness at the injection site 
Polycythemia vera Overview Polycythemia vera pol e sy THEE me uh VEER uh is a type of blood cancer 
It causes your bone marrow to make too many red blood cells 
It usually develops slowly, and you might have it for years without knowing 
Often the condition is found during a blood test done for another reason 
But proper medical care can help ease signs, symptoms and complications of this disease 
SymptomsMany people with polycythemia vera don t have noticeable signs or symptoms 
Some people might develop vague symptoms such as headache, dizziness, fatigue and blurred vision 
Numbness, tingling, burning, or weakness in your hands, feet, arms or legs 
It s often found during the middle or later stages of pregnancy 
Severe polyhydramnios may cause shortness of breath, preterm labor or other symptoms 
Severe polyhydramnios may need to be watched more closely by your care team 
Feelings of tightness in the muscles of the uterus, called contractions 
Conditions that affect the baby s digestive tract, central nervous system or certain other organs 
A decreased amount of red blood cells in the baby, also called fetal anemia 
A condition in which the pregnant parent s blood cells attack the baby s blood cells 
Often, the cause of polyhydramnios isn t clear, especially when the condition is mild 
The baby being born too early, also called premature birth 
The water breaking early, also called premature rupture of membranes 
Heavy bleeding due to decreased uterine muscle tone after delivery 
Polymorphous light eruption Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The rash usually appears as tiny, inflamed bumps or slightly raised patches of skin 
The reaction usually happens during spring and early summer when exposure to sunlight increases 
It s less likely to be repeated as the summer progresses 
But the rash often happens again each year after the first time 
The condition is also known as polymorphic light eruption, sun allergy and sun poisoning 
Polymorphous light eruption usually goes away on its own without scarring within days 
SymptomsSymptoms of the rash in polymorphous light eruption may include 
People may rarely have other symptoms such as fever and chills 
So it s important to get a prompt diagnosis and treatment 
Causes The exact cause of polymorphous light eruption isn t understood 
It leads to immune system activity that causes a rash 
PhotosensitivityWith polymorphous light eruption, sensitivity to sunlight lessens with repeated exposure 
Episodes are less likely to happen as the summer progresses 
After the first episode, it s likely to happen each year 
Most people who develop polymyalgia rheumatica are older than 
Giant cell arteritis can cause headaches, vision difficulties, jaw pain and scalp tenderness 
Aches or pain in your neck, upper arms, buttocks, hips or thighs 
Stiffness in affected areas, particularly in the morning or after being inactive for a time 
When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have aches, pains or stiffness that 
Limits your ability to do your usual activities, such as getting dressed 
Two factors appear to be involved in the development of this condition 
New cases of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to come in cycles, possibly developing seasonally 
This suggests that an environmental trigger, such as a virus, might play a role 
But no specific virus has been shown to cause polymyalgia rheumatica 
Giant cell arteritisPolymyalgia rheumatica and another disease known as giant cell arteritis share many similarities 
Many people who have one of these diseases also have symptoms of the other 
Signs and symptoms include headaches, jaw pain, vision problems and scalp tenderness 
If left untreated, this condition can lead to stroke or blindness 
Risk factors Risk factors for polymyalgia rheumatica include 
Women are about two to three times more likely to develop the disorder 
Getting out of bed, standing up from a chair or getting out of a car 
These difficulties can affect your health, social interactions, physical activity, sleep and general well being 
Polymyositis most commonly affects adults in their s, s or s 
Signs and symptoms usually develop gradually, over weeks or months 
When to see a doctorSeek medical attention if you develop unexplained muscle weakness 
Polymyositis may cause the muscular walls of your heart to become inflamed myocarditis 
A condition called interstitial lung disease may occur with polymyositis 
Signs and symptoms include a dry cough and shortness of breath 
People who have polymyositis have an elevated risk of cancer 
These polyps are rare and usually don t cause any signs or symptoms 
But certain types can increase your risk of stomach cancer 
But as a stomach polyp enlarges, open sores called ulcers can develop on its surface 
Rarely, the polyp can block the opening between your stomach and your small intestine 
Causes Stomach polyps form in response to damage to your stomach lining 
Also known as gastritis, this condition can cause the formation of hyperplastic polyps and adenomas 
When associated with this syndrome, fundic gland polyps are removed because they can become cancerous 
These polyps are generally small and aren t a cause for concern 
Risk factors Factors that increase your chances of developing stomach polyps include 
Stomach polyps are more common among people in midadulthood to late adulthood 
Long term use of proton pump inhibitors has been linked to fundic gland polyps 
Porphyrins are needed to make heme, a part of hemoglobin 
Without enough of any of these enzymes, porphyrins build up in the body 
High levels of porphyrins can cause major problems, mainly in the nervous system and skin 
Acute porphyrias start rapidly and mainly affect the nervous system 
A few types of porphyrias affect both the nervous system and the skin 
One or both parents pass along a changed gene to their child 
Although porphyria can t be cured, medicines and certain lifestyle changes may help you manage it 
Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of porphyria you have 
SymptomsSymptoms can vary widely by type of porphyria and in how severe the symptoms are 
Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms 
Acute porphyriasAcute porphyrias include forms of the disease that usually cause nervous system symptoms 
The most common form of acute porphyria is called acute intermittent porphyria AIP 
Intermittent means that the symptoms may go away but return later 
Porphyria cutanea tarda PCT is the most common type of all the porphyrias 
Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain in the skin 
Blisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face 
Erythropoietic protoporphyria uh rith roe poi ET ik pro toe por FEAR e uh , also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria 
Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling 
This can make it difficult to know if you re having an attack of porphyria 
If you have symptoms that could be porphyria, get medical attention 
Causes All types of porphyria involve a problem making heme 
Heme also plays a role in clearing drugs and hormones from the body 
This process involves eight different enzymes that turn porphyrins into heme 
A shortage or change in any of these enzymes causes a buildup of porphyrins 
In acute porphyrias, the buildup affects the nervous system, causing symptoms 
A changed gene from one of your parents autosomal dominant pattern 
This also is the case for most carriers of the changed genes 
Acquired formsPorphyria cutanea tarda PCT usually is not passed down in families 
In PCT, certain triggers can cause a buildup of porphyrins that may cause symptoms 
In addition to genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors may trigger symptoms in porphyria 
When exposed to the trigger, the body s demand for heme production increases 
Certain medicines, for example, birth control pills, sedatives and barbiturates 
Physical stress, such as infections or other illnesses or surgery 
Acute porphyrias can be life threatening if an attack isn t promptly treated 
You may need a stay in the hospital for treatment 
Cutaneous porphyrias also increase the risk of liver damage or liver cancer 
In rare cases, a bone marrow transplant or liver transplant may be needed 
Genetic counseling is important to help understand test results and risks 
It causes problems with eyesight and with processing visual information 
Common symptoms include trouble reading, judging distances and reaching for objects 
People with the syndrome may not be able to recognize objects and familiar faces 
Posterior cortical atrophy causes the loss of brain cells in back of the brain 
This is the region responsible for visual processing and spatial reasoning 
This changes a person s ability to process visual and spatial information 
In more than of cases, posterior cortical atrophy is due to Alzheimer s disease 
Telling the difference between objects that are moving and those that are still 
Other less common causes include corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease 
Researchers are looking at potential gene variations that may be related to the condition 
Overview A posterior vaginal prolapse is a bulge of tissue into the vagina 
It happens when the tissue between the rectum and the vagina weakens or tears 
This causes the rectum to push into the vaginal wall 
To pass stool, you might need to support the vaginal wall with your fingers 
If needed, self care measures and other nonsurgical options are often effective 
For severe posterior vaginal prolapse, you might need surgery to fix it 
SymptomsA small posterior vaginal prolapse rectocele might cause no symptoms 
A feeling that the rectum has not completely emptied after a bowel movement 
A surgeon can evaluate the prolapse and talk about options for surgery to fix it 
When to see a doctorSometimes, posterior vaginal prolapse doesn t cause problems 
But moderate or severe posterior vaginal prolapses might be uncomfortable 
See a health care provider if your symptoms affect your day to day life 
Causes Posterior vaginal prolapse results from pressure on the pelvic floor or trauma 
The more pregnancies you have, the greater your chance of developing posterior vaginal prolapse 
If you ve only had cesarean deliveries, you re less likely to develop posterior vaginal prolapse 
Risk factors Anyone with a vagina can develop posterior vaginal prolapse 
Some people are born with weaker connective tissues in the pelvic area 
This makes them naturally more likely to develop posterior vaginal prolapse 
Having vaginally delivered more than one child increases the risk of developing posterior vaginal prolapse 
Operative vaginal deliveries, and forceps specifically, increase the risk of developing this condition 
PreventionTo help keep posterior vaginal prolapse from getting worse, you might try to 
Use your legs instead of your waist or back to lift 
Ask your health care provider to help you determine the best weight for you 
Ask for advice on how to lose weight, if needed 
Most cases of postpartum preeclampsia develop within hours of childbirth 
But, postpartum preeclampsia sometimes develops up to six weeks or later after childbirth 
Left untreated, postpartum preeclampsia can cause seizures and other serious complications 
SymptomsPostpartum preeclampsia can be difficult to detect on your own 
Many women who experience postpartum preeclampsia show no signs or symptoms during pregnancy 
High blood pressure hypertension millimeters of mercury mm Hg or greater 
Pain in your upper belly, usually under the ribs on the right side 
Causes The causes of postpartum preeclampsia and preeclampsia that occurs during pregnancy aren t well understood 
Risk factors Limited research suggests that risk factors for postpartum preeclampsia might include 
The risk of postpartum preeclampsia is higher if you re obese 
Having twins, triplets or more increases your risk of preeclampsia 
Having uncontrolled high blood pressure before pregnancy increases your risk of preeclampsia and postpartum preeclampsia 
Postpartum eclampsia can permanently damage vital organs, including your brain, eyes, liver and kidneys 
This life threatening lung condition occurs when excess fluid develops in the lungs 
HELLP syndrome is particularly dangerous because it represents damage to several organ systems 
Recommend taking baby aspirin milligrams to prevent preeclampsia during your next pregnancy 
Encourage you to have an active lifestyle and to eat a healthy diet 
These signs and symptoms usually appear between to years after having polio 
Infection from the polio virus once caused paralysis and death 
However, the introduction of the inactivated polio vaccine in the s greatly reduced polio s spread 
Muscle and joint weakness and pain that gets worse over time 
They may experience new signs and symptoms followed by periods of stability 
When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have increasing weakness or fatigue 
Poliovirus particularly affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord 
A polio infection often damages or destroys many of these motor neurons 
Because there are fewer motor neurons, the remaining neurons sprout new fibers and grow bigger 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of developing post polio syndrome include 
This may be because greater recovery places additional stress on motor neurons 
Complications Post polio syndrome is rarely life threatening, but severe muscle weakness can lead to complications 
You then might break a bone, such as a hip, leading to other complications 
The fatigue may be disabling, even after very little activity 
It may also lead to problems with concentration and memory 
Musculoskeletal abnormalities and muscle weakness can lead to chronic pain 
You might then need treatment to help you breathe ventilation therapy 
If you have post polio syndrome, talk to your doctor about bone density screening 
Sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome are common in people with post polio syndrome 
These sleep disorders may worsen insomnia and fatigue if untreated 
These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships 
They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks 
Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person 
Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again flashbacks 
Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event 
Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event 
Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event 
Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include 
Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event 
Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions also called arousal symptoms may include 
Self destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast 
For children years old and younger, signs and symptoms may also include 
Re enacting the traumatic event or aspects of the traumatic event through play 
Frightening dreams that may or may not include aspects of the traumatic event 
For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences 
Getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent PTSD symptoms from getting worse 
Contact a minister, a spiritual leader or someone in your faith community 
Make an appointment with your doctor or a mental health professional 
As with most mental health problems, PTSD is probably caused by a complex mix of 
Stressful experiences, including the amount and severity of trauma you ve gone through in your life 
Inherited mental health risks, such as a family history of anxiety and depression 
Inherited features of your personality often called your temperament 
Risk factors People of all ages can have post traumatic stress disorder 
Having experienced other trauma earlier in life, such as childhood abuse 
Having other mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression 
Having problems with substance misuse, such as excess drinking or drug use 
Having blood relatives with mental health problems, including anxiety or depression 
The most common events leading to the development of PTSD include 
Having PTSD may also increase your risk of other mental health problems, such as 
Fear, anxiety, anger, depression, guilt all are common reactions to trauma 
However, the majority of people exposed to trauma do not develop long term post traumatic stress disorder 
This may mean turning to family and friends who will listen and offer comfort 
It may mean seeking out a mental health professional for a brief course of therapy 
Some people may also find it helpful to turn to their faith community 
Overview Vasectomy is a minor procedure that blocks the supply of sperm to the semen 
The sperm, which can no longer reach the semen, are absorbed by the body 
Vasectomy has a low risk of problems, but some men develop post vasectomy pain syndrome PVPS 
For some men, the pain is severe enough to seek treatment 
Swelling of the small, C shaped tube behind the testicle where sperm are stored epididymis 
Your provider may be able to treat the cause with medicine or a minor procedure 
A narrowing of nerves to the testicle may cause symptoms of PVPS 
Risk factors There are no known risk factors for developing PVPS 
Ongoing pain can affect quality of life for men with PVPS 
It occurs in about one quarter to nearly one half of the people who have the procedure 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of pouchitis can include diarrhea, abdominal pain, joint pain, cramps and fever 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of Prader Willi syndrome can vary among individuals 
Symptoms may slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood 
InfantsSigns and symptoms that may be present from birth include 
A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone hypotonia 
Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone 
Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive 
The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum cryptorchidism 
Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions 
Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities 
Poor articulation of words may be an ongoing problem into adulthood 
Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative 
They may also develop obsessive compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both 
Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop 
These disorders can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and worsen behavior problems 
There s some error or defect in paternal genes on chromosome 
Determining which genetic defect caused Prader Willi syndrome can be helpful in genetic counseling 
Other complications, such as an increased risk of liver disease and gallbladder stones 
Complications of inadequate hormone production Complications arising from inadequate hormone production may include 
Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle, so they may break easily 
Other complicationsOther complications that can result from Prader Willi syndrome include 
People with Prader Willi syndrome may not report pain and they rarely vomit 
Rarely, a person may eat so much that it causes stomach rupture 
Behavioral problems can interfere with family functioning, successful education and social participation 
A genetic counselor may help determine your risk of having another child with Prader Willi syndrome 
Overview Wolff Parkinson White WPW syndrome is a heart condition present at birth 
The episodes of fast heartbeats seen in Wolff Parkinson White syndrome usually aren t life threatening 
Rarely, the syndrome may lead to sudden cardiac death in children and young adults 
SymptomsThe heart rate is the number of times the heart beats each minute 
For example, the most common irregular heartbeat seen with WPW syndrome is supraventricular tachycardia SVT 
Symptoms in infantsInfants with WPW may have other symptoms, such as 
These changes may be harder or easier to see depending on skin color 
Some people with an extra electrical pathway don t have symptoms of a fast heartbeat 
Causes Wolff Parkinson White WPW syndrome is a heart condition present at birth 
Researchers aren t sure what causes most types of congenital heart defects 
WPW syndrome may occur with other congenital heart defects, such as Ebstein anomaly 
Your healthcare team may call this inherited or familial WPW syndrome 
It is associated with a thickened heart muscle, called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
The sinus node makes the signals that start each heartbeat 
In a typical heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly 
The resting heart rate is about to beats a minute 
The signals get excited, and the heart rate gets faster 
The extra pathway also can cause heart signals to travel backward 
Complications WPW syndrome has been linked to sudden cardiac death in children and young adults 
Overview A premature birth means a baby is born too early 
The birth takes place before the th week of pregnancy 
Premature babies often have serious health problems, especially when they re born very early 
But the earlier a baby is born, the higher the risk of health challenges 
Late preterm, born between and completed weeks of pregnancy 
Moderately preterm, born between and weeks of pregnancy 
Very preterm, born between and weeks of pregnancy 
SymptomsYour baby may have very mild symptoms of premature birth or more serious health problems 
Small size, with a head that s large compared with the body 
Low body temperature, mainly right after birth in the delivery room 
Weight, length and head circumference by gestational age for boys 
Weight, length and head circumference by gestational age for girls 
Your baby may need extra help feeding and adapting right after delivery 
Risk factors Often, the exact cause of premature birth isn t clear 
Some risk factors linked to past and present pregnancies include 
It s ideal to wait to months between pregnancies 
Treatments to help you get pregnant, called assisted reproduction, including in vitro fertilization 
Some health problems can raise the risk of premature birth, such as 
Some infections, mainly those of the amniotic fluid and lower genital tract 
Ongoing health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes 
Lifestyle choices also can raise the risk of a preterm pregnancy, such as 
Smoking cigarettes, taking illicit drugs or drinking alcohol often or heavily while pregnant 
Becoming pregnant before the age of or after 
In fact, many preterm births have no known risk factors 
But being born too early can cause short term and long term medical problems 
In general, the earlier a baby is born, the higher the risk of complications 
Short term complicationsIn the first weeks, the complications of premature birth may include 
It s common for preterm babies to have pauses in their breathing called apnea 
Most infants outgrow apnea by the time they go home from the hospital 
Some premature babies get a less common lung disorder called bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
They need oxygen for a few weeks or months, but they often outgrow this problem 
PDA is an opening between two important blood vessels, the aorta and the pulmonary artery 
But without treatment it can lead to problems such as heart failure 
That s when the heart can t pump blood as well as it should 
The earlier a baby is born, the greater the risk of bleeding in the brain 
Most hemorrhages are mild and resolve with little short term impact 
But some babies may have larger brain bleeding that causes permanent brain injury 
They don t have the stored body fat of a full term infant 
If body temperature drops too low, it can lead to a dangerous problem called hypothermia 
Hypothermia in a premature baby can lead to breathing problems and low blood sugar levels 
Premature infants are more likely to have digestive systems that aren t fully developed 
This can lead to problems such as necrotizing enterocolitis NEC 
With NEC, the cells lining the bowel wall are injured 
This problem can happen in premature babies after they start feeding 
Premature babies who receive only breast milk have a much lower risk of getting NEC 
Premature babies are at risk of blood problems such as anemia and newborn jaundice 
With anemia, the body doesn t have enough red blood cells 
Jaundice has many causes, but it is more common in preterm babies 
That s the process by which the body changes food and drink into energy 
Some premature babies may have a very low level of blood sugar 
It s common for premature babies to have immune systems that aren t fully developed 
Long term complicationsOver the long term, premature birth may lead to health problems such as 
This group of disorders can cause problems with movement, muscle tone or posture 
It can be due to an infection or poor blood flow 
Premature babies are more likely to lag behind full term babies on different milestones 
Premature infants may get an eye disease called retinopathy of prematurity 
Sometimes these overgrown vessels slowly scar the retina and pull it out of place 
Premature babies have a higher risk of losing some hearing 
All babies should have their hearing checked before they go home from the hospital 
Premature babies are more likely to have long term health issues than are full term infants 
Illnesses, asthma and feeding problems are more likely to develop or linger 
Premature infants also are at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome SIDS 
That s when an infant dies for unclear reasons, often while asleep 
But some things can be done to help lower the risk of preterm birth, including 
Progesterone is a hormone that plays a role in pregnancy 
It also may lower the risk of preterm birth if you have a short cervix 
During this procedure, the cervix is stitched closed with a strong suture 
The suture is removed when it s time to have the baby 
One thing that doesn t help prevent preterm birth is staying in bed 
Bed rest can raise the risk of blood clots, weaker bones and less muscle strength 
As many as out of people say they have it at some time 
Premature ejaculation isn t cause for concern if it doesn t happen often 
But you might be diagnosed with premature ejaculation if you 
Always or nearly always ejaculate within to minutes of penetration 
Are not able to delay ejaculation during sex all or nearly all the time 
Feel distressed and frustrated, and tend to avoid sexual intimacy as a result 
But it might occur in all sexual situations, even during masturbation 
Acquired premature ejaculation develops after having previous sexual experiences without problems with ejaculation 
It s common to feel embarrassed about discussing sexual health concerns 
But don t let that keep you from talking to your provider 
A conversation with a care provider might help lessen concerns 
Guilty feelings that can cause you to rush through sex 
It s common for premature ejaculation and anxiety to occur together 
The anxiety may be about sexual performance or related to other issues 
Biological causesA number of biological factors might contribute to premature ejaculation 
Risk factors Various factors can increase the risk of premature ejaculation 
Fear of losing an erection might cause you to hurry through sex 
This may happen whether you re aware of it or not 
Stress can limit the ability to relax and focus during sex 
Complications Premature ejaculation can cause issues in your personal life 
Premature ejaculation can sometimes make it hard for a partner to get pregnant 
This may happen if ejaculation doesn t occur in the vagina 
Another name for primary ovarian insufficiency is premature ovarian insufficiency 
It also used to be called premature ovarian failure, but this term isn t used anymore 
People with primary ovarian insufficiency can have irregular or occasional periods for years 
But people with premature menopause stop having periods and can t become pregnant 
Treatment can restore estrogen levels in people with primary ovarian insufficiency 
SymptomsSymptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency are like those of menopause or low estrogen 
It also could develop after a pregnancy or after stopping birth control pills 
But it s best to get a health care checkup whenever your menstrual cycle changes 
Low levels of estrogen also can lead to heart disease 
Most often, people assigned female at birth have two X chromosomes in their cells 
This can be a sign of genetic conditions such as mosaic Turner syndrome 
Other people with primary ovarian insufficiency have X chromosomes that are fragile and break 
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are common causes of toxin induced ovarian insufficiency 
Other toxins such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, pesticides and viruses might speed up ovarian insufficiency 
This harms sacs in the ovaries that each contain an egg, called follicles 
But being exposed to a virus may play a role 
Most often, the cause of primary ovarian insufficiency isn t clear 
Your health care professional may recommend more testing to try to find the cause 
Risk factors Factors that raise the risk of primary ovarian insufficiency include 
Having a family history of primary ovarian insufficiency raises the risk of getting this condition 
Surgeries that involve the ovaries raise the risk of primary ovarian insufficiency 
Complications Primary ovarian insufficiency can lead to other health conditions, including the following 
Not being able to get pregnant can be a complication of primary ovarian insufficiency 
Rarely, pregnancy is possible until the body s supply of eggs runs out 
This condition causes bones to become weak, brittle and more likely to break 
Women with low levels of the hormone estrogen have a higher risk of getting osteoporosis 
Some people with primary ovarian insufficiency become depressed or anxious 
Early loss of estrogen might raise the risk of heart conditions or stroke 
This long term condition affects the nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord 
It also affects parts of the body controlled by nerves 
Treatment for primary ovarian insufficiency helps prevent these other health conditions 
Premenstrual syndrome PMS Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Still, you don t have to let these problems control your life 
But a small number of women with premenstrual syndrome have disabling symptoms every month 
Overview Presbyopia is the gradual loss of your eyes ability to focus on nearby objects 
You can correct the condition with eyeglasses or contact lenses 
You may first notice these signs and symptoms after age 
A tendency to hold reading material farther away to make the letters clearer 
He or she can determine whether you have presbyopia and advise you of your options 
Have a sudden loss of vision in one eye with or without eye pain 
See flashes of light, black spots or halos around lights 
When you look at something at a distance, the circular muscle relaxes 
Risk factors Certain factors can make you more likely to develop presbyopia, including 
Almost everyone experiences some degree of presbyopia after age 
Certain drugs are associated with premature presbyopic symptoms, including antidepressants, antihistamines and diuretics 
Prescription drug abuse may become ongoing and compulsive, despite the negative consequences 
An increasing problem, prescription drug abuse can affect all age groups, including teens 
The prescription drugs most often misused include opioid painkillers, anti anxiety medicines, sedatives and stimulants 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of prescription drug abuse depend on the specific drug 
Because of their mind altering properties, the most misused prescription drugs are 
Requesting early refills or continually losing prescriptions, so more prescriptions must be written 
Causes Teens and adults abuse prescription drugs for many reasons, such as 
To try to improve concentration and school or work performance 
Prescription drug abuse is highest among teens and young adults 
Past or present addictions to other substances, including alcohol and tobacco 
Peer pressure or a social environment where there s drug use 
Easier access to prescription drugs, such as having prescription medicines in the home medicine cabinet 
Lack of knowledge about prescription drugs and their potential harm 
Complications Abusing prescription drugs can cause a number of problems 
Medical consequencesHere are examples of serious consequences of prescription drug abuse 
Opioids can cause a slowed breathing rate and potential for breathing to stop 
Make sure your health care provider clearly understands your condition and the signs and symptoms 
Ask your doctor whether there s another medicine with ingredients that have less potential for addiction 
Don t order prescriptions online unless they re from a trustworthy pharmacy 
Some websites sell counterfeit prescription and over the counter drugs that could be dangerous 
Preventing prescription drug abuse in teensPrescription drugs are commonly misused substances by young people 
Follow these steps to help prevent your teen from abusing prescription medicines 
Using alcohol with medicines can increase the risk of accidental overdose 
Keep track of drug quantities and keep them in a locked medicine cabinet 
Some websites sell counterfeit and dangerous drugs that may not require a prescription 
Check the label or patient information guide for disposal instructions 
You can also ask your pharmacist for advice on disposal 
The earlier premature birth happens, the greater the health risks for your baby 
Many premature babies preemies need special care in the neonatal intensive care unit 
A change in type of vaginal discharge watery, mucus like or bloody 
Don t worry about mistaking false labor for the real thing 
Many factors have been associated with an increased risk of preterm labor, however, including 
Certain infections, particularly of the amniotic fluid and lower genital tract 
Some chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, autoimmune disease and depression 
Stressful life events, such as the death of a loved one 
Complications Complications of preterm labor include delivering a preterm baby 
Prenatal visits can help your health care provider monitor your health and your baby s health 
PUFAs are found in nuts, seeds, fish and seed oils 
Ask your health care provider about a smoking cessation program 
Consider talking to your health care provider about pregnancy spacing 
Work with your health care provider to keep any chronic conditions under control 
At times, this can lead to permanent scarring of liver tissue, called cirrhosis 
Although it affects both sexes, primary biliary cholangitis mostly affects women 
Researchers think a combination of genetic and environmental factors triggers the disease 
Symptoms eventually develop over the next to years 
Those who do have symptoms at diagnosis typically have poorer outcomes 
Buildup of fluid in the abdomen due to liver failure, called ascites 
Darkening of the skin that s not related to sun exposure, called hyperpigmentation 
Weak and brittle bones, called osteoporosis, which can lead to fractures 
Researchers believe this autoimmune response may be triggered by environmental and genetic factors 
Usually, these immune cells detect and help defend against germs, such as bacteria and viruses 
Inflammation in the smallest ducts spreads and eventually damages other cells in the liver 
Risk factors The following factors may increase your risk of primary biliary cholangitis 
It s most likely to occur in people to years old 
Researchers think that genetic factors combined with certain environmental factors trigger primary biliary cholangitis 
Exposure to toxic chemicals, such as in certain work environments 
Complications As liver damage worsens, primary biliary cholangitis can cause serious health problems, including 
Cirrhosis makes it difficult for your liver to work and may lead to liver failure 
People with primary biliary cholangitis and cirrhosis have a poor medical outlook 
When scar tissue from cirrhosis blocks normal blood flow through your liver, blood backs up 
It usually backs up into those in your stomach and esophagus 
Increased pressure may cause delicate veins to break open and bleed 
Bleeding in the upper stomach or esophagus is a life threatening emergency 
Your spleen may become swollen with white blood cells and platelets 
If you have liver scarring, you ll need regular cancer screening 
Up to of people with primary biliary cholangitis have high cholesterol 
Some people with advanced primary biliary cholangitis and cirrhosis have personality changes 
It also can be associated with dry eyes and mouth, a disorder called Sjogren s syndrome 
So far, researchers have identified more than forms of primary immunodeficiency disorders 
Some forms are so mild they can go unnoticed until adulthood 
Other types are severe enough that they re discovered soon after an affected baby is born 
Treatments can boost the immune system in many types of primary immunodeficiency disorders 
Frequent and recurrent pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, ear infections, meningitis or skin infections 
Digestive problems, such as cramping, loss of appetite, nausea and diarrhea 
Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or type diabetes 
Causes Many primary immunodeficiency disorders are inherited passed down from one or both parents 
Damage to the heart, lungs, nervous system or digestive tract 
PreventionBecause primary immune disorders are caused by genetic changes, there s no way to prevent them 
Wash your hands with mild soap after using the toilet and before eating 
Some studies suggest that stress can hamper your immune system 
Keep stress in check with massage, meditation, yoga, biofeedback or hobbies 
Stay away from people with colds or other infections and avoid crowds 
Proctitis Overview Proctitis is inflammation of the lining of the rectum 
The rectum is a muscular tube that s connected to the end of your colon 
Stool passes through the rectum on its way out of the body 
Proctitis symptoms can be short lived, or they can become chronic 
Proctitis is common in people who have inflammatory bowel disease Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis 
Proctitis also can be a side effect of radiation therapy for certain cancers 
A frequent or continuous feeling that you need to have a bowel movement 
Causes Several diseases and conditions can cause inflammation of the rectal lining 
Sexually transmitted infections that can cause proctitis include gonorrhea, genital herpes and chlamydia 
Radiation proctitis can begin during radiation treatment and last for a few months after treatment 
This can occur in infants who drink either cow s milk or soy based formula 
Infants breast fed by mothers who eat dairy products also may develop proctitis 
Risk factors Risk factors for proctitis include 
The surest way to prevent an STI is to abstain from sex, especially anal sex 
If you choose to have sex, reduce your risk of an STI by 
Ask your doctor when it s safe to have sex again 
There s no cure for progressive supranuclear palsy, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms 
A tendency to fall backward can occur very early in the disease 
People with progressive supranuclear palsy may not be able to look downward 
Not being able to focus the eyes can make some people spill food 
They also may appear disinterested in conversation because of lack of eye contact 
A surprised or frightened facial expression, resulting from rigid facial muscles 
Clumps of tau also are found in other brain diseases, such as Alzheimer s disease 
Most people with progressive supranuclear palsy haven t inherited the disorder 
Risk factors The only proven risk factor for progressive supranuclear palsy is age 
The condition typically affects people in their late s and s 
It s virtually unknown in people under the age of 
Falling, which could lead to head injuries, fractures and other injuries 
Trouble focusing your eyes, which also can lead to injuries 
Trouble sleeping, which can lead to feeling tired and excessive daytime sleeping 
Pneumonia is the most common cause of death in people with progressive supranuclear palsy 
For example, standing up without waiting for assistance, which can lead to falls 
To avoid the hazards of choking, your healthcare professional may recommend a feeding tube 
To avoid injuries due to falling, a walker or a wheelchair may be used 
Prolactinoma Overview Prolactinoma is a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland 
This tumor causes the pituitary gland to make too much of a hormone called prolactin 
But it can cause vision difficulties, infertility and other problems 
In some cases, surgery to remove the tumor might be an option 
However, too much prolactin in your blood hyperprolactinemia can cause symptoms 
So can pressure on surrounding tissues from a large tumor 
Milky discharge from the breasts when not pregnant or breastfeeding 
This is probably because of missed or irregular menstrual periods 
Males are also more likely to notice signs and symptoms later 
Causes Prolactinoma is one type of tumor that develops in the pituitary gland 
The pituitary gland is a small bean shaped gland located at the base of your brain 
Its hormones help control important functions such as growth, metabolism, blood pressure and reproduction 
A prolactinoma causes the pituitary gland to make too much of a hormone called prolactin 
This results in a decreased level of some sex hormones namely, estrogen and testosterone 
Making too much prolactin hyperprolactinemia can also happen for reasons other than a prolactinoma 
Risk factors More prolactinomas occur in females than males 
Too much prolactin reduces the production of the hormones estrogen and testosterone 
In males, too much prolactin also can lead to decreased sperm production 
This results in weak and brittle bones that can break easily 
Left untreated, a prolactinoma may grow large enough to press on your optic nerve 
The nerve sends images from your eye to your brain so that you can see 
Larger prolactinomas can put pressure on the healthy part of the pituitary gland 
This can lead to lower levels of other hormones controlled by the pituitary gland 
Overview Prostatitis is a disorder of the prostate gland usually associated with inflammation 
Bacterial infections cause some but not all cases of prostatitis 
It surrounds the top portion of the tube that drains urine from the bladder urethra 
The prostate and other sex glands produce the fluid that transports sperm during ejaculation semen 
Acute bacterial prostatitis, a bacterial infection of the prostate usually with sudden, severe symptoms 
Chronic bacterial prostatitis, ongoing or recurring bacterial infection usually with less severe symptoms 
Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, signs of an inflamed prostate with no symptoms 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of prostatitis can vary depending on the type of disorder 
Pain in the area between the scrotum and rectum perineum 
Fever, chills, muscle aches and other flu like symptoms with acute bacterial prostatitis 
It s important to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible 
Get immediate care if you have any of the following 
Severe discomfort or pain in the pelvic area or genitals 
Causes Causes vary depending on the type of prostatitis 
Acute bacterial prostatitis is usually caused by common strains of bacteria 
The infection may have spread from other parts of the urinary or reproductive systems 
Chronic bacterial prostatitis generally has the same cause as acute bacterial infection 
Research suggests that multiple factors may collectively play a role 
Risk factors Risk factors for prostatitis include 
Use of a tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder urinary catheter 
Additional risk factors for chronic prostatitis chronic pelvic pain syndrome may include 
Nerve damage in the pelvic region due to surgery or trauma 
Complications Complications of acute or chronic prostatitis can include 
Inflammation of the coiled tube attached to the back of the testicle epididymitis 
Infection that spreads to the upper pelvic bone or lower spine 
Complications of chronic prostatitis chronic pelvic pain syndrome may include 
Sexual dysfunction, such as the inability to get and maintain an erection erectile dysfunction 
There s no direct evidence that prostatitis can lead to prostate cancer 
Researchers are investigating whether chronic inflammation of the prostate is a risk factor for cancer 
With pseudocholinesterase deficiency, the body muscles stay relaxed for a longer time than expected 
Pseudocholinesterase deficiency can be caused by a gene change mutation that is inherited 
This condition can also be caused by illness, injury or certain medications 
During that time, you can t move or breathe on your own 
The length of time may vary widely among people with this disorder 
This enzyme is needed to break down metabolize drugs known as choline esters 
Succinylcholine is used as part of anesthesia to relax the muscles during medical procedures 
Pseudocholinesterase deficiency causes the muscles to stay relaxed for too long after getting succinylcholine 
Inherited pseudocholinesterase deficiencyInherited pseudocholinesterase deficiency is caused by a change in the butyrylcholinesterase BCHE gene 
Genetic testing can show whether you have this gene change 
If you inherit only one affected gene, you won t have the disorder 
These conditions include chronic infections, kidney or liver disease, malnutrition, severe burns, cancer, or pregnancy 
Acquired pseudocholinesterase deficiency is not inherited and cannot be passed to your children 
Pseudogout is formally known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease or CPPD 
But the condition is commonly called pseudogout because of its similarity to gout 
When a pseudogout attack occurs, the affected joints are usually 
But most people who have these crystal deposits never develop pseudogout 
It s not clear why some people have symptoms and others don t 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of pseudogout include 
In some families, family members have a hereditary tendency to develop pseudogout 
Pseudogout has also been linked to an underactive thyroid gland or an overactive parathyroid gland 
Psoriasis is a common, long term chronic disease with no cure 
It can be painful, interfere with sleep and make it hard to concentrate 
Cyclic rashes that flare for a few weeks or months and then subside 
There are several types of psoriasis, each of which varies in its signs and symptoms 
They usually appear on the elbows, knees, lower back and scalp 
Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration 
Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed onycholysis 
It s usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat 
It s marked by small, drop shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs 
Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts 
It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating 
Pustular psoriasis, a rare type, causes clearly defined pus filled blisters 
It can occur in widespread patches or on small areas of the palms or soles 
Causes you concern about the appearance of your skin 
Researchers believe that both genetics and environmental factors play a role 
Certain medications including lithium, high blood pressure drugs and antimalarial drugs 
These factors can increase the risk of developing the disease 
Having one parent with psoriasis increases your risk of getting the disease 
And having two parents with psoriasis increases your risk even more 
Complications If you have psoriasis, you re at greater risk of developing other conditions, including 
Psoriatic arthritis, which causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in and around the joints 
Temporary skin color changes post inflammatory hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation where plaques have healed 
Overview Pulmonary atresia uh TREE zhuh is a heart problem present at birth 
Instead of a valve that opens and closes, a solid sheet of tissue forms 
So, blood can t travel its usual path to get oxygen from the lungs 
Pulmonary atresia is a life threatening condition that needs emergency treatment 
Treatment includes surgery to repair the heart and medicines to help the heart work better 
SymptomsSymptoms of pulmonary atresia may be seen soon after birth 
Blue or gray skin, lips or fingernails due to low oxygen levels 
Depending on the skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see 
When to see a doctorPulmonary atresia is most often found soon after birth 
How the heart worksThe typical heart is made of four chambers 
There are two upper chambers, called atria, and two lower chambers, called ventricles 
In pulmonary atresia, the pulmonary valve doesn t form as usual so it can t open 
Blood can t flow from the right ventricle to the lungs 
Before birth, not having a pulmonary valve opening doesn t affect the baby s oxygen 
The oxygen rich blood from the placenta goes to the baby s right upper heart chamber 
It lets oxygen rich blood move to the rest of the baby s body through the aorta 
There the blood picks up oxygen to send to the rest of the baby s body 
If there s no VSD, the right lower heart chamber gets little blood flow before birth 
This is a condition called pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum PA IVS 
Risk factors Pulmonary atresia happens as the baby s heart is forming during pregnancy 
Screening can help show the risk of certain congenital heart defects in future children 
Complications Without treatment, pulmonary atresia most often leads to death 
Bacterial infection of the inner lining of the heart and valves, called infectious endocarditis 
If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar in check 
Obesity increases the risk of having a baby with a congenital heart defect 
In pulmonary atresia, the valve between the heart and lungs isn t fully formed 
This opening, called the ductus arteriosus, most often closes soon after birth 
A baby with pulmonary atresia doesn t get enough oxygen in the blood 
DiagnosisTests used to diagnose pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum PA IVS include 
This simple test measures the electrical activity of the heart 
The sensors connect to a monitor, which prints or displays results 
A chest X ray shows the shape and size of the heart and lungs 
An echocardiogram can be done during pregnancy is called a fetal echocardiogram 
Dye flows through the catheter and into the heart arteries 
The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X rays 
MedicationsMedicine may be given through an IV to keep the ductus arteriosus open 
The type of surgery or procedure depends on many things 
This treatment is done to fix a pulmonary valve with a narrowed opening 
A balloon on the tip of the catheter is inflated to widen the valve opening 
Making the hole larger increases the amount of blood available to travel to the lungs 
Keeping it open allows blood to travel to the lungs 
An example of this treatment is the Blalock Taussig shunt procedure 
But babies usually outgrow this shunt within a few months 
This surgery most often is done between and months of age 
The heart then pumps blood through the pulmonary valve that s been repaired 
These are surgical and catheter treatments that are done at the same time 
This type of healthcare professional is called a pediatric cardiologist 
The VSD lets blood flow into and out of the right lower heart chamber 
Some blood also may flow through a natural opening called the ductus arteriosus 
Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect is a life threatening condition 
Tests that may be used to diagnose pulmonary atresia with VSD 
Sound waves are used to make images of the beating heart 
An echocardiogram of the mother s belly before delivery is called a fetal echocardiogram 
This quick and simple test shows how the heart is beating 
The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on images 
A cardiac CT can help diagnose major aortopulmonary collateral arteries MAPCAs 
TreatmentA baby with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect VSD needs treatment right away 
Treatment may include medicines and one or more surgeries or procedures 
Surgeries or other procedures to treat pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect may include 
This treatment is done to look at the baby s heart 
Sometimes doctors use it to rebuild the blood vessels coming off the pulmonary artery 
The vessel is between the body s main artery and the pulmonary artery 
The stent keeps it open and lets blood flow into the lungs 
An example is the Blalock Taussig shunt, also called the BT shunt 
This treatment is usually done between and months of age 
Pulmonary valve disease changes how blood flows from the heart to the lungs 
It then goes to the pulmonary artery and into the lungs 
Blood picks up oxygen in the lungs to take to the body 
Blood moves backward into the right lower heart chamber, called the right ventricle 
Blood can t go to the lungs to pick up oxygen 
Many types of pulmonary valve disease are due to heart conditions present at birth 
Treatment depends on the type and severity of pulmonary valve disease 
Pulmonary valve stenosis Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
In a narrowed heart valve, the valve flaps may become thick or stiff 
Usually, pulmonary valve disease is caused by a heart problem that develops before birth 
A heart problem present at birth is called a congenital heart defect 
In adults, pulmonary valve stenosis may be a complication of another illness 
Some people with mild pulmonary valve stenosis don t have symptoms 
SymptomsPulmonary valve stenosis symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked 
Some people with mild pulmonary stenosis do not have symptoms 
Those with more severe pulmonary stenosis may first notice symptoms while exercising 
A whooshing sound called a heart murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope 
Prompt diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary valve stenosis can help reduce the risk of complications 
Causes Pulmonary valve stenosis usually results from a heart problem present at birth 
The pulmonary valve doesn t develop properly as the baby is growing in the womb 
In pulmonary valve stenosis, one or more of the cusps may be stiff or thick 
The smaller opening makes it harder for blood to leave the lower right heart chamber 
Risk factors Things that may increase the risk of pulmonary valve stenosis include 
Having German measles during pregnancy increases the risk of pulmonary valve stenosis in the baby 
It can lead to many problems with the heart s structure and function 
This complication of strep throat can cause permanent damage to the heart and heart valves 
It increases the risk of developing pulmonary valve stenosis later in life 
This condition occurs when a rare cancerous tumor releases certain chemicals into the bloodstream 
Some people with this syndrome develop carcinoid heart disease, which damages heart valves 
Infection of the lining of the heart, called infective endocarditis 
People with pulmonary stenosis are more likely to have irregular heartbeats 
Unless the stenosis is severe, irregular heartbeats due to pulmonary stenosis usually aren t life threatening 
The strain on the heart causes the muscular wall of the ventricle to thicken 
If the right ventricle can t pump properly, heart failure eventually develops 
Pyloric stenosis can lead to forceful vomiting, dehydration and weight loss 
Babies with pyloric stenosis may seem to be hungry all the time 
SymptomsSymptoms of pyloric stenosis usually appear within to weeks after birth 
Pyloric stenosis is rare in babies older than months 
The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away 
But over time, it becomes more severe as the pylorus opening narrows 
Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting 
These contractions are part of the digestive process known as peristalsis 
The contractions are caused by stomach muscles trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus 
Pyloric stenosis can keep a baby from gaining weight, and sometimes can cause weight loss 
When to see a doctorSee your baby s doctor if your baby 
Urinates much less frequently or has noticeably fewer bowel movements 
Pyloric stenosis usually isn t present at birth and probably develops afterward 
Risk factors Risk factors for pyloric stenosis include 
Pyloric stenosis is seen more often in boys, especially firstborn children, than in girls 
Pyloric stenosis is more common in white and Hispanic children 
Pyloric stenosis is more common in babies born prematurely than in full term babies 
Studies found higher rates of this disorder among certain families 
This behavior can nearly double the risk of pyloric stenosis 
Some studies suggest that bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding can increase the risk of pyloric stenosis 
Repeated vomiting can irritate your baby s stomach and may cause mild bleeding 
They usually clear up with treatment, but scarring and recurrences are common 
Within days, this bump can develop into a large, painful open sore 
The ulcer usually appears on your legs, but may develop anywhere on your body 
If you have several ulcers, they may grow and merge into one larger ulcer 
It s often associated with autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn s disease and arthritis 
Risk factors Certain factors may increase your risk of pyoderma gangrenosum, including 
People with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum 
If you have the condition, try to avoid injuring your skin 
Injury or trauma to your skin, including from surgery, can provoke new ulcers to form 
It may also help to control any underlying condition that may be causing the ulcers 
In developing countries, stray dogs are the most likely to spread rabies to people 
Fear brought on by attempts to drink fluids because of difficulty swallowing water 
Even if you aren t sure whether you ve been bitten, seek medical attention 
If you awake to find a bat in your room, assume you ve been bitten 
Infected animals can spread the virus by biting another animal or a person 
This could happen if an infected animal licked an open cut on your skin 
The animals most likely to spread the rabies virus to people include 
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of rabies include 
Traveling or living in developing countries where rabies is more common 
PreventionTo reduce your risk of coming in contact with rabid animals 
Ask your veterinarian how often your pets should be vaccinated 
This will help keep your pets from coming in contact with wild animals 
Seal any cracks and gaps where bats can enter your home 
Consider the rabies vaccine if you re traveling or often around animals that may have rabies 
This includes traveling to remote areas where medical care is difficult to find 
Overview Radiation enteritis is inflammation of the intestines that occurs after radiation therapy 
Chronic radiation enteritis can cause complications such as anemia, diarrhea or bowel obstruction 
SymptomsThe symptoms of radiation enteritis include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps 
Symptoms occur because of irritation of the intestines from radiation therapy for cancer 
Radiation enteritis that goes on for longer can cause anemia and bowel obstruction 
Radiation enteritis occurs because radiation therapy can cause irritation of the intestines 
Many types of irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, can cause tachycardia 
For instance, the heart rate usually rises during exercise or as a response to stress 
But sometimes it s a warning of a medical condition that needs attention 
Some forms of tachycardia can lead to serious health problems if left untreated 
Such problems may include heart failure, stroke or sudden cardiac death 
Common types of tachycardia caused by irregular heart rhythms include 
Chaotic, irregular electrical signals start in the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria 
Atrial flutter is similar to A fib, but heartbeats are more organized 
Episodes of atrial flutter may go away by themselves or may need treatment 
People who have atrial flutter also often have A fib at other times 
This irregular heart rhythm starts in the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles 
Episodes may be brief and last only a couple of seconds without causing harm 
But episodes lasting more than a few seconds can be life threatening 
Supraventricular tachycardia causes episodes of a pounding heartbeat that begin and end abruptly 
This serious condition can be deadly if the heart rhythm isn t reset within minutes 
Racing, pounding heartbeat or flopping in the chest, called palpitations 
A type of tachycardia called ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention 
CPR helps keep blood flowing to the organs until other treatments can start 
The American Heart Association suggests doing compressions to the beat of the song Stayin Alive 
Have someone get an automated external defibrillator AED if one is nearby 
An AED is a portable device that delivers a shock to reset the heart rhythm 
Causes Tachycardia is an increased heart rate for any reason 
If a fast heart rate is caused by exercise or stress, it s called sinus tachycardia 
Most heart conditions can lead to different forms of tachycardia 
An example of an irregular heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation AFib 
Changes in the level of minerals in the body, called electrolytes 
But in tachycardia, something causes the heart to beat faster than beats a minute 
Lifestyle changes or treatment of heart conditions may lower the risk of tachycardia 
As a result, the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen 
Blood clots that can cause a heart attack or stroke 
This is usually only associated with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation 
PreventionThe best way to prevent tachycardia is to keep the heart healthy 
Try these tips to prevent heart disease and keep the heart healthy 
Some cold and cough medicines have stimulants that may start a rapid heartbeat 
In Raynaud s disease, smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin narrow 
This limits blood flow to affected areas, which is called vasospasm 
Women are more likely than men to have Raynaud s disease 
It seems to be more common in people who live in colder climates 
Treatment of Raynaud s disease depends on its severity and whether you have other health conditions 
For most people, Raynaud s disease isn t disabling, but it can affect your quality of life 
Numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming or stress relief 
During an attack of Raynaud s, affected areas of the skin usually first turn pale 
Next, they often change color and feel cold and numb 
After warming up, the return of blood flow to the area can take minutes 
Causes Experts don t fully understand the cause of Raynaud s attacks 
With Raynaud s, arteries to the fingers and toes narrow when exposed to cold or stress 
Over time, these small arteries can thicken slightly and limit blood flow even more 
Cold temperatures are the most likely cause of an attack 
Primary vs secondary Raynaud sThere are two main types of the condition 
Also called Raynaud s disease, this most common form isn t the result of another medical condition 
It can be so mild that many people with primary Raynaud s don t seek treatment 
Also called Raynaud s phenomenon, this form develops because of another health condition 
Other diseases that increase the risk of Raynaud s include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren s syndrome 
This condition involves pressure on a major nerve to the hand 
Typing, playing piano or doing movements like that for long periods can cause overuse injuries 
Risk factors Risk factors for primary Raynaud s include 
The illness also is more common in people who live in colder climates 
These include jobs that cause repeated trauma, such as using tools that vibrate 
A completely blocked artery can lead to skin sores or dead tissue 
Rarely, very bad untreated instances might require removing the affected part of the body 
Run your car heater for a few minutes before driving in cold weather 
To take food out of the refrigerator or freezer, wear gloves, mittens or oven mitts 
Some people find it helpful to wear mittens and socks to bed during winter 
Because air conditioning can cause attacks, set your air conditioner to a warmer temperature 
While rectal prolapse may cause pain, it s rarely a medical emergency 
Rectal prolapse is sometimes treated with stool softeners, suppositories and other medicines 
The lump may slip back inside the anus, or it may continue to be seen 
You cannot control your bowel movements, known as fecal incontinence 
Feeling that your rectum isn t empty after a bowel movement 
Risk factors Some things may increase your risk of getting rectal prolapse, including 
Rectal prolapse most often happens in people over age 
Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The rectum is a muscular tube connected to the end of your colon 
Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can cause rectal bleeding and straining during bowel movements 
Despite the name, sometimes more than one rectal ulcer occurs in solitary rectal ulcer syndrome 
However, some people with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome may experience no symptoms 
Causes It s not always clear what causes solitary rectal ulcer syndrome 
Doctors believe stress or injury to the rectum may cause rectal ulcers to form 
Constipation or hardened stool in the rectum that s difficult to pass impacted stool 
A stretched rectum that comes out of the anus rectal prolapse 
Uncoordinated tightening of the pelvic floor muscles that slows blood flow to the rectum 
When one part of the intestine slides inside another part intussusception 
Complication from diverticulitis, an infection of small, bulging pouches in the digestive tract 
The condition may cause gas and stool to leak out of the vagina 
Some rectovaginal fistulas may close on their own, but most need surgery to fix them 
Depending on the fistula s size and location, you may have only minor symptoms 
Causes A rectovaginal fistula may form as a result of 
Delivery related injuries are the most common cause of rectovaginal fistulas 
These inflammatory bowel diseases cause swelling and irritation of the tissues lining the digestive tract 
Also, radiation therapy for cancers in these areas can put you at risk 
Risk factors A rectovaginal fistula has no clear risk factors 
Complications Complications of a rectovaginal fistula may include 
Irritation or inflammation of your vagina, perineum or the skin around your anus 
Among people with Crohn s disease who develop a fistula, the chances of complications are high 
These can include poor healing, or another fistula forming later 
PreventionThere are no steps you need to take to prevent a rectovaginal fistula 
Overview Recurrent breast cancer is breast cancer that comes back after initial treatment 
Recurrent breast cancer may occur months or years after your initial treatment 
Learning you have recurrent breast cancer may be harder than dealing with the initial diagnosis 
Treatment may eliminate local, regional or distant recurrent breast cancer 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of recurrent breast cancer vary depending on where the cancer comes back 
Local recurrenceIn a local recurrence, cancer reappears in the same area as your original cancer 
If you ve undergone a lumpectomy, the cancer could recur in the remaining breast tissue 
Signs and symptoms of local recurrence within the same breast may include 
A new lump in your breast or irregular area of firmness 
Signs and symptoms of local recurrence on the chest wall after a mastectomy may include 
One or more painless nodules on or under the skin of your chest wall 
A new area of thickening along or near the mastectomy scar 
Persistent and worsening pain, such as chest, back or hip pain 
During follow up exams, your doctor checks for any symptoms or signs of cancer recurrence 
You can also report any new signs or symptoms to your doctor 
But sometimes these treatments aren t able to kill all of the cancer cells 
Sometimes cancer cells may be dormant for years without causing harm 
People with larger tumors have a greater risk of recurrent breast cancer 
A pathologist examines the edges of the tissue to look for cancer cells 
People with inflammatory breast cancer have a higher risk of local recurrence 
Having a higher body mass index increases your risk of recurrence 
PreventionStrategies that have been linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence include 
Maintaining a healthy weight may help decrease the risk of recurrent breast cancer 
Regular exercise may reduce your risk of breast cancer recurrence 
Focus on including lots of vegetables, fruits and whole grains in your diet 
If you choose to drink alcohol, limit yourself to one drink a day 
Normally, urine flows from your kidneys through the ureters down to your bladder 
Treatment, which includes medication or surgery, aims at preventing kidney damage 
SymptomsUrinary tract infections commonly occur in people with vesicoureteral reflux 
Signs and symptoms in infants with a UTI may also include 
As your child gets older, untreated vesicoureteral reflux can lead to 
Is also eating poorly or has had significant changes in mood 
Causes Your urinary system includes your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra 
All play a role in removing waste products from your body via urine 
Vesicoureteral reflux can develop in two types, primary and secondary 
Risk factors Risk factors for vesicoureteral reflux include 
White children appear to have a higher risk of vesicoureteral reflux 
Generally, girls have a much higher risk of having this condition than boys do 
Children whose parents had the condition are at higher risk of developing it 
Complications Kidney damage is the primary concern with vesicoureteral reflux 
The more severe the reflux, the more serious the complications are likely to be 
Untreated UTIs can lead to scarring, which is permanent damage to kidney tissue 
Extensive scarring may lead to high blood pressure and kidney failure 
Scarring can cause a loss of function in the filtering part of the kidney 
Noises, such as talking, laughing, shouting, emotional outcries or even cursing 
Being able to recall the dream if you awaken during the episode 
Risk factors Factors associated with the development of REM sleep behavior disorder include 
Having narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness 
Taking certain medications, especially newer antidepressants, or the use or withdrawal of drugs or alcohol 
Complications Complications caused by REM sleep behavior disorder may include 
Distress to your sleeping partner or other people living in your home 
Social isolation for fear that others may become aware of your sleep disruption 
Narrowing of the arteries prevents enough oxygen rich blood from reaching your kidneys 
Your kidneys need adequate blood flow to help filter waste products and remove excess fluids 
SymptomsRenal artery stenosis often doesn t cause any signs or symptoms until it s advanced 
The condition may be discovered incidentally during testing for something else 
Your health care provider may also suspect a problem if you have 
High blood pressure that begins suddenly or worsens without explanation 
High blood pressure that begins before age or after age 
As renal artery stenosis progresses, other signs and symptoms may include 
Elevated protein levels in the urine or other signs of a problem with kidney function 
Causes The two main causes of renal artery stenosis include 
In fibromuscular dysplasia, the muscle in the artery wall doesn t grow as it should 
The renal artery can narrow so much that the kidney doesn t get enough blood 
This can lead to high blood pressure at a young age 
Risk factors Most cases of renal artery stenosis result from narrowed kidney arteries 
Kidney failure, requiring treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant 
Fluid retention in your legs, causing swollen ankles or feet 
Shortness of breath due to a sudden buildup of fluid in the lungs 
It occurs in about half of people who have had an amputation 
Residual limb pain usually isn t severe, but it may feel 
In some people, the residual limb may move uncontrollably in small or significant ways 
But residual limb pain and phantom pain often occur together 
Respiratory syncytial virus RSV Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
It s so common that most children have been infected with the virus by age 
Self care measures are usually all that s needed to relieve any discomfort 
In adults and older children, RSV usually causes mild cold like signs and symptoms 
Wheezing a high pitched noise that s usually heard on breathing out exhaling 
Bluish color of the skin due to lack of oxygen cyanosis 
Signs and symptoms of severe RSV infection in infants include 
Struggling to breathe chest muscles and skin pull inward with each breath 
In children, COVID often results in mild symptoms such as fever, runny nose and cough 
For adults with COVID , symptoms may be more severe and may include trouble breathing 
And these infections may occur together, which can worsen the severity of COVID illness 
Causes Respiratory syncytial virus enters the body through the eyes, nose or mouth 
It spreads easily through the air on infected respiratory droplets 
The virus also passes to others through direct contact, such as shaking hands 
An infected person is most contagious during the first week or so after infection 
People at increased risk of severe or sometimes life threatening RSV infections include 
Infants, especially premature infants or babies who are months or younger 
These complications can occur when the virus spreads to the lower respiratory tract 
It s even possible for it to happen during the same RSV season 
Both are approved by the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA 
You and your healthcare professional can discuss which option is best to protect your child 
It s for babies younger than months born during or entering their first RSV season 
Two vaccines are available for this age group Abrysvo and Arexvy 
Lifestyle habitsThese lifestyle habits can help prevent the spread of this infection 
Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze 
Limit your baby s contact with people who have fevers or colds 
Make sure kitchen and bathroom countertops, doorknobs, and handles are clean 
Use your own glass or disposable cups when you or someone else is sick 
If you do smoke, never do so inside the house or car 
Do this especially when your child or a playmate is sick 
The urge to move usually is caused by an uncomfortable feeling in the legs 
It typically happens in the evening or at night when sitting or lying down 
Restless legs syndrome can begin at any age and tends to get worse with age 
Simple self care steps and lifestyle changes may help relieve symptoms 
SymptomsThe chief symptom of restless legs syndrome is an urge to move the legs 
It might happen while sitting in a car, airplane or movie theater 
Stretching, jiggling the legs, pacing or walking may improve symptoms 
RLS may be associated with another, more common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep 
This condition causes the legs to twitch and kick during sleep, possibly throughout the night 
People typically describe RLS symptoms as compelling, unpleasant feelings in the legs or feet 
The sensations are felt within the leg rather than on the skin 
People with RLS usually don t describe the condition as a muscle cramp or numbness 
They do, however, consistently describe the desire to move the legs 
Sometimes symptoms disappear for periods of time, then come back 
RLS can interfere with your sleep, cause daytime drowsiness and affect your quality of life 
Causes Often, there s no known cause for restless legs syndrome 
Researchers suspect the condition may be caused by an imbalance of the brain chemical dopamine 
HereditySometimes RLS runs in families, especially if the condition starts before age 
Researchers have identified sites on the chromosomes where genes for RLS may be present 
Some people get RLS for the first time during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester 
Risk factors Restless legs syndrome can develop at any age, even during childhood 
RLS usually isn t related to a serious underlying medical condition 
Too little iron in the body, known as iron deficiency, can cause or worsen RLS 
Deficiency also may affect people who have heavy menstrual periods or who often donate blood 
If you have kidney failure, you also may have iron deficiency, often with anemia 
When kidneys don t function properly, iron stores in the blood can decrease 
This and other changes in body chemistry may cause or worsen RLS 
Damage or injury of the spinal cord has been linked to RLS 
Many people with RLS find it hard to fall or stay asleep 
Serious symptoms of RLS can affect quality of life and result in depression 
Overview Retinal diseases vary widely, but most of them cause visual symptoms 
Depending on your condition, treatment goals may be to stop or slow the disease 
Untreated, some retinal diseases can cause severe vision loss or blindness 
It s often accompanied by the sudden onset of symptoms such as floaters and flashing lights 
A retinal detachment is defined by the presence of fluid under the retina 
This causes the retina to swell, which may blur or distort your vision 
Or you may develop new, irregular capillaries that break and bleed 
This membrane pulls up on the retina, which distorts your vision 
In macular degeneration, the center of the retina begins to deteriorate 
There are two types wet macular degeneration and dry macular degeneration 
It slowly affects the retina and causes loss of night and side vision 
Blurred or distorted vision in which straight lines can look wavy 
You may need to try looking with each eye alone to notice these changes 
Seek immediate medical attention if you suddenly have floaters, flashes or reduced vision 
Risk factors Risk factors for retinal diseases might include 
Upon release, the testicle will remain in the proper position at least temporarily 
The testicle moves to its correct location in the scrotum and stays there permanently 
Sometimes the retractile testicle remains in the groin and is no longer movable 
When this happens, the condition is called an ascending testicle or an acquired undescended testicle 
During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum 
If this descent isn t completed at birth, the testicle usually descends within a few months 
The testicle might spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time 
An undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum 
Causes An overactive muscle causes a testicle to become a retractile testicle 
The cremaster muscle is a thin pouch like muscle in which a testicle rests 
When the cremaster muscle contracts, it pulls the testicle up toward the body 
Risk factors There are no known risk factors for retractile testicles 
Although you still reach sexual climax, you might ejaculate very little or no semen 
Retrograde ejaculation isn t harmful, but it can cause male infertility 
Treatment for retrograde ejaculation is generally only needed to restore fertility 
Urine that is cloudy after orgasm because it contains semen 
This is the same muscle that holds urine in your bladder until you urinate 
With retrograde ejaculation, the bladder neck muscle doesn t tighten properly 
Several conditions can cause problems with the muscle that closes the bladder during ejaculation 
Side effect of certain medications used to treat high blood pressure, prostate enlargement and depression 
A dry orgasm is the primary sign of retrograde ejaculation 
Risk factors You re at increased risk of retrograde ejaculation if 
You take certain drugs for high blood pressure or a mood disorder 
This disorder causes a progressive loss of motor skills and language 
Unusual hand movements, such as repetitive rubbing or clapping, replace purposeful hand use 
Although there s no cure for Rett syndrome, potential treatments are being studied 
SymptomsBabies with Rett syndrome usually are born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery 
Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child 
As children get older, there is delayed growth in other parts of the body 
At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly, and then it continues more gradually 
Eventually muscles become weak or stiff, with unusual movement and positioning 
They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings 
Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of language 
Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills 
Hand movements may include hand wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing 
Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older 
Loss of skills may be connected to losing the ability to think, understand and learn 
Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives 
Multiple seizure types may occur and are associated with changes on an electroencephalogram EEG 
It typically begins between and years of age and progresses with age 
Stages of Rett syndromeRett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages 
Stage can last for a few months or a year 
This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months 
Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don t occur before the age of 
It s marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contractures and scoliosis 
Slowed growth of your child s head or other parts of the body 
Decreasing eye contact or loss of interest in usual play 
However, the exact cause is not fully understood and is still being studied 
Most of them die before birth or in early infancy 
Pain that may accompany problems such as gastrointestinal issues or bone fractures 
Needing lifelong care and assistance with activities of daily living 
In most cases, the genetic changes that cause the disorder occur spontaneously 
Symptoms such as confusion, seizures and loss of consciousness need emergency treatment 
Early diagnosis and treatment of Reye s syndrome can save a child s life 
Talk to your health care provider if you have concerns 
The liver also may swell, and fats may build up 
This may be the flu, known as influenza, or chickenpox 
Or Reye s syndrome may develop after an upper respiratory infection such as a cold 
Initial symptomsFor children younger than age , the first symptoms of Reye s syndrome may include 
Additional symptomsAs the condition progresses, symptoms may become more serious, including 
Weakness in the arms and legs or not being able to move them 
If you suspect that your child has Reye s syndrome, it s important to act quickly 
The most frequent of these rare disorders is medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase MCAD deficiency 
This happens because an enzyme is missing or not working properly 
A screening test can determine if your child has a fatty acid oxidation disorder 
Reye s syndrome may develop after influenza or chickenpox in particular 
This may include a fatty acid oxidation disorder or another disorder of mitochondrial function 
Complications Most children and teenagers who have Reye s syndrome survive 
Without proper diagnosis and treatment, Reye s syndrome can cause death within a few days 
Children with known fatty acid oxidation disorders should not take aspirin or aspirin containing products 
Always check the label before you give your child medicine 
This includes products you buy without a prescription and alternative or herbal remedies 
Aspirin can show up in some unexpected products such as Alka Seltzer 
This may include infants or children s acetaminophen Tylenol, others or ibuprofen Advil, Motrin, others 
If your child needs to take aspirin, make sure your child s vaccines are current 
This includes two doses of the chickenpox vaccine and a yearly flu vaccine 
Avoiding these two viral illnesses can help prevent Reye s syndrome 
Soft tissues support and connect organs and other parts of the body 
Although rhabdomyosarcoma can start anywhere in the body, it s more likely to start in the 
Research into diagnosis and treatment have greatly improved the outlook for people diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma 
More and more people are living for years after a rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosis 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma depend on where the cancer starts 
For example, if the cancer is in the head or neck area, symptoms may include 
If the cancer is in the urinary or reproductive system, symptoms may include 
If the cancer is in the arms or legs, symptoms may include 
It starts when a soft tissue cell develops changes in its DNA 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma include 
Rarely, rhabdomyosarcoma has been linked to genetic syndromes that are passed from parents to children 
These include neurofibromatosis , Noonan syndrome, Li Fraumeni syndrome, Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome and Costello syndrome 
Complications Complications of rhabdomyosarcoma and its treatment include 
Rhabdomyosarcoma can spread from where it started to other parts of the body 
Rhabdomyosarcoma most often spreads to the lungs, lymph nodes and bones 
Rhabdomyosarcoma and its treatments can cause many side effects, both short and long term 
Strep throat and scarlet fever are caused by an infection with streptococcus strep toe KOK us bacteria 
Rheumatic fever most often affects children ages to 
Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States and other developed countries 
Rheumatic fever can cause long lasting heart damage, including heart valve problems and heart failure 
Other medicines are used to treat pain and prevent complications 
SymptomsRheumatic fever symptoms usually start about to weeks after a strep throat infection 
Symptoms can come and go or change while a person is sick with rheumatic fever 
Joint pain or swelling most often the knees, ankles, elbows and wrists 
Flat or slightly raised, painless rash with a ragged edge 
Some people with rheumatic fever develop a condition called Sydenham chorea 
Jerky, uncontrollable body movements, most often in the hands, feet and face 
When to see a doctorProperly treating strep throat can prevent rheumatic fever 
Improperly treated strep throat or scarlet fever infections cause rheumatic fever 
It may be that the bacteria trick the body s immune system into attacking healthy tissue 
This usually happens in the heart, joints, skin and central nervous system 
The incorrect immune system reaction causes swelling of joints and tissues 
Risk factors Things that may increase the risk of rheumatic fever include 
Some strains of strep bacteria are more likely to cause rheumatic fever than others 
Rheumatic heart disease usually occurs years to decades after the original illness 
The valve between the two left chambers of the heart is most commonly affected 
The valve flaps become thick or stiff and possibly connect together 
Tissue swelling from rheumatic fever can weaken the heart muscle 
Heart damage from rheumatic fever also may cause heart failure later in life 
It s also important to finish all of the prescribed antibiotics as directed 
Vitamin D helps your child s body absorb calcium and phosphorus from food 
Some skeletal deformities caused by rickets may require corrective surgery 
Causes Your child s body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium and phosphorus from food 
Occasionally, not getting enough calcium or lack of calcium and vitamin D can cause rickets 
Your child s skin produces vitamin D when it s exposed to sunlight 
But children in developed countries tend to spend less time outdoors 
Risk factors Factors that can increase a child s risk of rickets include 
Breast milk doesn t contain enough vitamin D to prevent rickets 
Babies who are exclusively breast fed should receive vitamin D drops 
Milk, but not foods made from milk, such as some yogurts and cheese 
Check labels to determine the vitamin D content of fortified foods 
If you re pregnant, ask your doctor about taking vitamin D supplements 
It affects about to of people, and is especially common in older adults 
However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including 
Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear 
Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go 
When to see a doctorSome people aren t very bothered by tinnitus 
If you have tinnitus that bothers you, see your doctor 
You are experiencing anxiety or depression as a result of your tinnitus 
Causes A number of health conditions can cause or worsen tinnitus 
Common causes of tinnitusIn many people, tinnitus is caused by one of the following 
A blockage can change the pressure in your ear, causing tinnitus 
Generally, the higher the dose of these medications, the worse tinnitus becomes 
Often the unwanted noise disappears when you stop using these drugs 
This condition, caused by abnormal bone growth, tends to run in families 
Other head, neck or brain tumors can also cause tinnitus 
These blood flow changes can cause tinnitus or make tinnitus more noticeable 
Risk factors Anyone can experience tinnitus, but these factors may increase your risk 
For some people, tinnitus can significantly affect quality of life 
PreventionIn many cases, tinnitus is the result of something that can t be prevented 
However, some precautions can help prevent certain kinds of tinnitus 
And if you cannot avoid loud sounds, use ear protection to help protect your hearing 
These substances, especially when used in excess, can affect blood flow and contribute to tinnitus 
It s usually an itchy, circular rash with clearer skin in the middle 
Ringworm often spreads by direct skin to skin contact with an infected person or animal 
Mild ringworm often responds to antifungal medications applied to the skin 
For more severe infections, you may need to take antifungal pills for several weeks 
A scaly ring shaped area, typically on the buttocks, trunk, arms and legs 
Ringworm often spreads by direct, skin to skin contact with an infected person 
You can contract ringworm by touching an animal with ringworm 
Ringworm can spread while petting or grooming dogs or cats 
In rare cases, ringworm can be spread to humans by contact with infected soil 
Infection would most likely occur only from prolonged contact with highly infected soil 
Risk factors You re at higher risk of ringworm of the body if you 
Share clothing, bedding or towels with someone who has a fungal infection 
Participate in sports that feature skin to skin contact, such as wrestling 
Be aware of the risk of ringworm from infected people or pets 
Tell your children about ringworm, what to watch for and how to avoid infection 
Keep shared areas clean, especially in schools, child care centers, gyms and locker rooms 
Don t wear thick clothing for long periods of time in warm, humid weather 
The infection often looks like a patch of skin where fur is missing 
If you have pets or other animals, ask your veterinarian to check them for ringworm 
Don t let others use your clothing, towels, hairbrushes, sports gear or other personal items 
It usually causes itchy, scaly, bald patches on the head 
Medicated shampoos may help keep a person from spreading the infection to others 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of ringworm of the scalp may include 
Brittle or fragile hair that can be easily broken or pulled out 
When to see a doctorSeveral conditions affecting the scalp may have a similar appearance 
It s important to get an accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment with prescription medicine 
Nonprescription creams, lotions and powders won t get rid of ringworm of the scalp 
Causes Ringworm of the scalp is caused by a common fungus 
The fungus attacks the outer layer of skin on the scalp and the hair 
Ringworm often spreads through direct skin to skin contact with an infected person 
Ringworm can spread while petting or grooming dogs or cats with ringworm 
Ringworm is fairly common in kittens, puppies, cows, goats, pigs and horses 
This includes items such as clothing, towels, bedding, combs and brushes 
Risk factors Risk factors for ringworm of the scalp include 
Ringworm of the scalp is most common in toddlers and school age children 
Complications Some people with ringworm of the scalp may develop a severe inflammation called kerion 
With kerion, the hair falls out or can be easily pulled out 
Tell children about ringworm, what to watch for and how to avoid the infection 
Be sure to wash your child s scalp regularly, especially after haircuts 
Be sure children wash their hands, including after playing with pets 
It also may cause enlarged blood vessels and small, pus filled bumps 
Some symptoms may flare for weeks to months and then go away for a while 
Rosacea can be mistaken for acne, dermatitis or other skin problems 
Over time, you may notice that your face stays red 
Depending on skin color, redness may be subtle or look more pink or purple 
Small blood vessels of the nose and cheeks break and become larger 
They may be subtle and hard to see, depending on skin color 
Many people with rosacea develop pimples on the face that look like acne 
The skin of the affected area may feel hot and tender 
Many people with rosacea also have dry, irritated, swollen eyes and eyelids 
Eye symptoms may show up before, after or at the same time as skin symptoms 
Rosacea is not caused by poor hygiene, and you can t catch it from other people 
Drugs that dilate blood vessels, including some blood pressure medicines 
Roseola Overview Roseola is a common infection that usually affects children by age 
It s caused by a virus that spreads from person to person 
It can cause a high fever followed by a rash that doesn t itch or hurt 
About a quarter of the people with roseola get a rash 
Treatment of roseola includes cool cloths and medications to reduce fever 
It s possible to become infected with roseola but not show any sign of it 
Roseola often starts with a high fever often higher than F C 
Your child may also develop swollen lymph nodes in the neck 
If your child has an unexplained seizure, seek medical care immediately 
Call your child s health care providerCall your child s health care provider if 
Your child has a high fever, over F C 
The rash doesn t improve after three days and the fever returns 
Roseola is no longer contagious after the fever has been gone for hours 
The infection most often occurs in the spring and fall 
Risk factors The risk of roseola is highest in older infants 
Newborns are protected by antibodies received from their mothers during pregnancy 
Complications Roseola is usually a mild disease, but it can cause complications 
People with a weak immune system have less resistance to viruses 
They tend to develop more severe roseola or complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis 
Then, even if a roseola rash is present the disease isn t contagious 
Physical therapy exercises can improve flexibility and strength of the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint 
Sometimes, rotator cuff tears may occur from a single injury 
In those circumstances, people should seek medical advice quickly because they might need surgery 
Be described as a dull ache deep in the shoulder 
Make it difficult to comb your hair or reach behind your back 
When to see a doctorYour family doctor can evaluate short term shoulder pain 
Repetitive overhead activity or prolonged bouts of heavy lifting can irritate or damage the tendon 
The rotator cuff can also be injured in a single incident during falls or accidents 
The risk of a rotator cuff injury increases with age 
Rotator cuff tears are most common in people older than 
Rotavirus Overview Rotavirus is a very contagious virus that causes diarrhea 
Occasionally, severe dehydration requires receiving fluids through a vein intravenously in the hospital 
Good hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly, is important 
But vaccination is the best way to prevent rotavirus infection 
SymptomsA rotavirus infection usually starts within two days of exposure to the virus 
When to see a doctorCall your child s doctor if your child 
Has black or tarry stool or stool containing blood or pus 
Has a temperature of F C or higher 
The virus can remain infectious on surfaces that haven t been disinfected for weeks or months 
It s possible to be infected with rotavirus more than once, even if you ve been vaccinated 
In the United States, the risk of rotavirus is highest in winter and spring 
Complications Severe diarrhea can lead to dehydration, particularly in young children 
Left untreated, dehydration can become a life threatening condition regardless of its cause 
And commonly used alcohol based hand sanitizers have little effect on rotavirus 
The World Health Organization recommends that all countries give infants a rotavirus vaccine 
The vaccine isn t approved for use in older children or adults 
Even so, the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks 
The regurgitated food is then chewed again and swallowed or spit out 
Behavioral therapy typically involves teaching people to breathe from the diaphragm 
But it appears to be caused by an increase in abdominal pressure 
Rumination syndrome is often confused with bulimia nervosa, gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD and gastroparesis 
Some people have rumination syndrome linked to a rectal evacuation disorder 
The condition has long been known to happen in infants and people with developmental disabilities 
Untreated, rumination syndrome can damage the tube between the mouth and stomach, called the esophagus 
If you have an enlarged spleen, a less forceful trauma might cause rupture 
Without emergency treatment, the internal bleeding caused by a ruptured spleen can be life threatening 
Others can be treated with several days of hospital care 
When to see a doctorA ruptured spleen is a medical emergency 
Your spleen can become enlarged when blood cells accumulate in the spleen 
Complications A ruptured spleen can cause life threatening bleeding into your stomach cavity 
Overview Sacroiliitis say kroe il e I tis is a painful condition that affects one or both sacroiliac joints 
These joints sit where the lower spine and pelvis meet 
Standing or sitting for a long time or climbing stairs can make the pain worse 
It can be mistaken for other causes of low back pain 
It s been linked to a group of diseases that cause inflammatory arthritis of the spine 
SymptomsThe pain of sacroiliitis most often occurs in the buttocks and lower back 
It also can affect the legs, groin and even the feet 
Wear and tear arthritis, also known as osteoarthritis, can occur in sacroiliac joints 
So can a type of arthritis that affects the spine, known as ankylosing spondylitis 
The added weight and changed way of walking during pregnancy can stress these joints 
Risk factors Certain conditions may increase the risk of swelling in the sacroiliac joints 
Inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis, also may increase the risk 
The ongoing pain of sacroiliitis can lead to depression and loss of sleep 
Seasonal affective disorder SAD Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
These symptoms often resolve during the spring and summer months 
Treatment for SAD may include light therapy phototherapy , psychotherapy and medications 
Take steps to keep your mood and motivation steady throughout the year 
Less commonly, people with the opposite pattern have symptoms that begin in spring or summer 
Feeling listless, sad or down most of the day, nearly every day 
Fall and winter SADSymptoms specific to winter onset SAD, sometimes called winter depression, may include 
Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates 
They may also experience depression during the fall and winter months 
When to see a doctorIt s normal to have some days when you feel down 
Causes The specific cause of seasonal affective disorder remains unknown 
The reduced level of sunlight in fall and winter may cause winter onset SAD 
Reduced sunlight can cause a drop in serotonin that may trigger depression 
Risk factors Seasonal affective disorder is diagnosed more often in women than in men 
And SAD occurs more frequently in younger adults than in older adults 
Factors that may increase your risk of seasonal affective disorder include 
Symptoms of depression may worsen seasonally if you have one of these conditions 
Complications Take signs and symptoms of seasonal affective disorder seriously 
Other mental health disorders such as anxiety or eating disorders 
PreventionThere s no known way to prevent the development of seasonal affective disorder 
Other people need continuous treatment to prevent symptoms from returning 
Salivary gland tumors can begin in any of your salivary glands 
Most are noncancerous benign , but sometimes they can be cancerous 
Treatment for salivary gland tumors is usually with surgery to remove the tumor 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of a salivary gland tumor may include 
A lump or swelling on or near your jaw or in your neck or mouth 
The abnormal cells go on living when healthy cells would die 
If additional changes happen in the DNA, the abnormal cells may become cancerous 
Types of salivary gland tumorsMany different types of salivary gland tumors exist 
Doctors classify salivary gland tumors based on the type of cells involved in the tumors 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of salivary gland tumors include 
People who work with certain substances may have an increased risk of salivary gland tumors 
Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through stool feces 
Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food 
Most healthy people recover within a few days to a week without specific treatment 
In some cases, diarrhea can cause severe dehydration and requires prompt medical attention 
Life threatening complications also may develop if the infection spreads beyond the intestines 
Often, people who have salmonella infection think they have the stomach flu 
Signs and symptoms of salmonella infection generally last a few days to a week 
Causes Salmonella bacteria live in the intestines of people, animals and birds 
Feces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process 
Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of foods such as mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce 
Some pet foods may be contaminated with salmonella and can infect animals 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of salmonella infection include 
Activities that may bring you into closer contact with salmonella bacteria 
Health problems that may weaken your resistance to infection in general 
Some animals, particularly birds and reptiles, can carry salmonella bacteria 
Salmonella can also be found in animal pens, tanks, cages and litter boxes 
Stomach or bowel disordersThe body has many natural defenses against salmonella infection 
For example, strong stomach acid can kill many types of salmonella bacteria 
But some medical problems or medications can short circuit these natural defenses 
Lowering the stomach s acidity allows more salmonella bacteria to survive 
This interferes with your body s ability to fight infection and disease 
BacteremiaIf salmonella infection enters your bloodstream bacteremia , it can infect tissues throughout your body, including 
The purpose is to cut the number of salmonella infections in the United States 
Wash your hands with soap and water for seconds after you 
Touch pets or other animals and their habitats, especially reptiles or birds 
Store raw meat, poultry and seafood away from other foods in your refrigerator 
Never place cooked food on an unwashed plate that previously held raw meat 
If you must consume raw eggs, make sure they ve been pasteurized 
But it can also affect the eyes, skin, heart and other organs 
However, sarcoidosis may last for years and may cause organ damage 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on which organs are affected 
Sarcoidosis sometimes develops gradually and produces symptoms that last for years 
Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly 
Lung symptomsSarcoidosis most often affects the lungs and may cause lung problems, such as 
Areas of skin that are darker or lighter in color 
Growths under the skin nodules , particularly around scars or tattoos 
When eye signs and symptoms do occur, they may include 
Heart symptomsSigns and symptoms related to cardiac sarcoidosis may include 
When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis 
As granulomas build up in an organ, the function of that organ can be affected 
Risk factors While anyone can develop sarcoidosis, factors that may increase your risk include 
African Americans are more likely to have involvement of other organs along with the lungs 
If someone in your family has had sarcoidosis, you re more likely to develop the disease 
Inflammation in the facial nerves, for example, can cause facial paralysis 
Soft tissue sarcoma forms in the tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures 
This includes muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and the lining of your joints 
Treatment for sarcoma varies depending on sarcoma type, location and other factors 
In general, cancer forms when changes mutations happen in the DNA within cells 
If this happens, the accumulating abnormal cells can form a tumor 
Cells can break away and spread metastasize to other parts of the body 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of sarcoma include 
Some syndromes that increase the risk of cancer can be passed from parents to children 
Radiation treatment for cancer increases the risk of developing a sarcoma later 
It increases the risk of a type of sarcoma called angiosarcoma 
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
The excess bacteria often cause diarrhea and may cause weight loss and malnutrition 
Sometimes surgery is needed to correct the problem, but antibiotics are the most common treatment 
If you have severe abdominal pain, seek immediate medical care 
Causes Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO can be caused by 
The bacteria may produce toxins as well as interfere with the absorption of nutrients 
The breakdown products following bacterial digestion of food can also trigger diarrhea 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of SIBO include 
Crohn s disease, intestinal lymphoma or scleroderma involving the small intestine 
Complications Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO can cause escalating problems, including 
And compounds produced through the bacterial break down of stagnant food can also trigger diarrhea 
Together, these effects of bacterial overgrowth result in diarrhea, malnutrition and weight loss 
Damage to your central nervous system resulting from B deficiency may be irreversible 
Poor calcium absorption may also eventually result in kidney stones 
Intense itching occurs in the area where the mite burrows 
Medicated skin creams or pills kill the mites that cause scabies and their eggs 
But itching may not stop for many weeks after treatment 
Thin, wavy tunnels made up of tiny blisters or bumps on the skin 
But scabies can appear on many parts of the body 
In adults and older children, scabies is most often found 
In infants and young children, common sites of scabies usually include the 
If you ve had scabies before, symptoms may start within a few days of exposure 
You can still spread scabies even if you don t have any symptoms yet 
But they won t get rid of the mites or their eggs 
The scabies mites that affect animals don t survive or reproduce in people 
Complications Scratching too much can break your skin and cause an infection, such as impetigo 
A more severe type of scabies, called crusted scabies, may affect certain people, including 
People who are very sick, such as people in hospitals or nursing facilities 
Crusted scabies makes the skin crusty and scaly, and affects large areas of the body 
Quick treatment with both a prescription pill and a skin cream is needed 
Typically, someone with scabies has about to mites 
But someone with crusted scabies may have millions of mites 
It s a good idea to clean your home to prevent scabies from spreading 
Vacuum furniture, carpets and floors to remove scales and crusts that may have scabies mites 
SCAD can cause sudden death if it isn t treated promptly 
Do not drive yourself unless you have no other choice 
Causes The cause of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is unknown 
Risk factors Risk factors for SCAD include 
Some women who have had SCAD have recently given birth 
This may be due to changes in hormones and stress on the blood vessels 
SCAD has been found to occur most often in the first few weeks after delivery 
FMD may lead to artery problems such as aneurysm or dissection 
Ehlers Danlos and Marfan syndromes have been found to occur in people who have had SCAD 
Severe high blood pressure can raise the risk of SCAD 
Using cocaine or other illegal drugs might increase the risk of SCAD 
Scarlet fever almost always includes a sore throat and a high fever 
Scarlet fever is most common in children to years of age 
SymptomsThe signs and symptoms that give scarlet fever its name include 
The rash looks like a sunburn and feels like sandpaper 
The face may appear flushed with a pale ring around the mouth 
Fever of F C or higher, often with chills 
Very sore and red throat, sometimes with white or yellowish patches 
Enlarged glands in the neck lymph nodes that are tender to the touch

Trouble breathing grunting, pulling in chest muscles between the ribs, nostril flaring 
Noisy, wheezy or raspy breathing that does not clear with coughing 
Inability to swallow liquids or saliva, muffled voice, or inability to open mouth fully 
Confusion, lack of energy, or inability to stay alert and awake 
For infants less than months old, additional symptoms needing emergency evaluation include 
Temperature less than F C or greater than F C 
In scarlet fever, the bacteria release a toxin that produces the rash and red tongue 
Scarlet fever most often occurs after a strep throat infection 
Sometimes scarlet fever may occur after a skin infection, such as impetigo 
Complications If scarlet fever goes untreated, the bacteria may spread to the 
Alcohol based hand sanitizer can be used if soap and water are not available 
Bipolar type, which includes episodes of mania and sometimes major depression 
Schizoaffective disorder may run a unique course in each affected person

Taking mind altering drugs, which may worsen symptoms when an underlying disorder is present 
Complications People with schizoaffective disorder are at an increased risk of 
Overview Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally 
SymptomsSchizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking cognition , behavior and emotions 
This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation 
Behavior isn t focused on a goal, so it s hard to do tasks 
In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid s 
So it often falls to family or friends to get them help 
Laws on involuntary commitment for mental health treatment vary by state 
You can contact community mental health agencies or police departments in your area for details 
Taking mind altering psychoactive or psychotropic drugs during teen years and young adulthood 
Complications Left untreated, schizophrenia can result in severe problems that affect every area of life 
Complications that schizophrenia may cause or be associated with include 
renia as early as possible may significantly improve your child s long term outcome 
Overview A spinal cord injury involves damage to any part of the spinal cord 
One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord 
The completeness of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost 
Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis 
Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as 
This includes a change in the ability to feel heat, cold and touch 
Emergency symptomsEmergency symptoms of a spinal cord injury after an accident include 
Extreme back pain or pressure in the neck, head or back 
Weakness, incoordination or loss of control in any part of the body 
Numbness, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands, fingers, feet or toes 
It is safest to assume that the person has a spinal injury until proved otherwise 
If a spinal injury occurs but it is not known, worse injury may occur 
Numbness or paralysis can happen quickly or come on gradually 
Learning the level of the injury can help determine the possible recovery 
If you suspect that someone has a back or neck injury 
Other causes of a spinal cord injury don t include trauma 
Arthritis, cancer, inflammation, infections or disk degeneration of the spine can be possible causes 
Your brain and central nervous systemThe central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord 
The spinal cord is made of soft tissue and is surrounded by bones called vertebrae 
Below this region is a group of nerve roots called the cauda equina 
Motor tracts carry signals from your brain to control muscle movement 
This can impair part of or all the muscles and nerves below the injury site 
Auto and motorcycle accidents are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries 
They account for almost half of new spinal cord injuries each year 
A spinal cord injury after age is most often caused by a fall 
About of spinal cord injuries result from violent encounters, usually from gunshot wounds 
Cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis and inflammation of the spinal cord also can cause spinal cord injuries 
But certain factors can increase the risk of having a spinal cord injury, including 
More than half of spinal cord injuries occur in people in this age range 
Another spike in spinal cord injuries occurs at age 
Alcohol use is involved in about of traumatic spinal cord injuries 
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries for people under 
Complications A spinal cord injury can lead to many complications 
Your rehabilitation team helps you develop tools to address these complications 
The team also recommends equipment and resources to promote your quality of life and independence 
The bladder continues to store urine from the kidneys after a spinal cord injury 
Changes in bladder control increase the risk of urinary tract infections 
The changes also may cause kidney infections and kidney or bladder stones 
During rehabilitation, you learn ways to help empty your bladder 
You also can learn ways to help control your bowel 
Changing positions often with help, if needed can help prevent the sores 
They also may have swelling in the arms and legs 
Your rehabilitation team can teach you how to address these issues if they affect you 
The neurological level of injury determines what kind of breathing problems you may have 
Medicines and therapy can be helpful for treatment and prevention 
Other people may have soft and limp muscles lacking muscle tone, known as flaccidity 
Weight loss and muscle thinning are common soon after a spinal cord injury 
A dietitian can help you eat a nutritious diet to sustain a healthy weight 
Physical and occupational therapists can help you develop a fitness and exercise program 
Healthcare professionals specializing in urology or fertility can offer options for sexual functioning and fertility 
Pain and the changes a spinal cord injury brings can cause depression in some people 
PreventionFollowing this advice might reduce your risk of a spinal cord injury 
Car crashes are one of the most common causes of spinal cord injuries 
Wear a seat belt every time you are in a moving vehicle 
Use a step stool with a grab bar to reach high up objects 
Put nonslip mats on tile floors and in the tub or shower 
For young children, use safety gates to block stairs and consider installing window guards 
In American football, don t tackle using the top of your helmet 
Don t drive after drinking alcohol or while under the influence of drugs 
Overview Sciatica refers to pain that travels along the path of the sciatic nerve 
The sciatic nerve travels from the buttocks and down each leg 
This causes inflammation, pain and often some numbness in the affected leg 
SymptomsSciatica pain can be almost anywhere along the nerve pathway 
The pain can vary from a mild ache to a sharp, burning pain 
It can be worse when coughing or sneezing or sitting a long time 
Some people also have numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness in the leg or foot 
One part of the leg can be in pain, while another part can feel numb 
When to see a doctorMild sciatica usually goes away over time 
Call your primary care professional if self care measures don t ease symptoms 
Also call if pain lasts longer than a week, is severe or gets worse 
Pain after a violent injury, such as a traffic accident 
Causes Sciatica occurs when the nerve roots to the sciatic nerve become pinched 
More rarely, a tumor can put pressure on the nerve 
Risk factors Risk factors for sciatica include 
People ages to are most likely to have herniated disks 
Complications Most people recover fully from sciatica caused by herniated disks, often without treatment 
PreventionIt s not always possible to prevent sciatica, and the condition can come back 
When lifting something heavy, let your legs do the work 
It may also cause problems in the blood vessels, internal organs and digestive tract 
Both types can involve any of the other vascular or organ problems 
Localized scleroderma, also known as morphea, affects only the skin 
Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face 
Raynaud s phenomenon also can occur in people who don t have scleroderma 
Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include 
There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage 
Causes Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues 
Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma 
People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma 
Complications Scleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the 
In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die 
Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise 
You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs 
Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function 
Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure 
Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart 
Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing 
It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea 
Sclerosing mesenteritis is rare, and it s not clear what causes it 
Sclerosing mesenteritis can cause belly pain, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea and fever 
But some people experience no symptoms and may never need treatment 
SymptomsSymptoms of sclerosing mesenteritis include pain in the belly, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea and fever 
Young children and older adults are most at risk of serious complications 
Scorpions are arthropods a relative of insects, spiders and crustaceans 
Most stings occur when they re accidentally grabbed or stepped on or brushed against the body 
SymptomsSymptoms at the site of a scorpion sting may include 
Being restless or excitable, or crying in children that can t be comforted 
To reach a poison control center in the U S , call Poison Help at 
Causes A scorpion sting is caused by the stinger in a scorpion s tail 
The venom contains a complex mix of toxins that affect the nervous system 
Risk factors Your risk of a scorpion sting rises if you 
That s because scorpions can hide in clothing, luggage and shipping containers 
They also live under tree bark, which is how they get their name 
The cause is usually heart or lung failure that occurs some hours after the sting 
Very few deaths from scorpion stings have been reported in the U S 
Rarely, scorpion stings can cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis 
Caulk cracks, install weatherstripping around doors and windows, and repair torn screens 
Also, shake out your clothing, bedding, gear and packages often 
If you find a scorpion, use tongs to gently move it away from people 
This can help you spot masses early, when many treatments work better 
Dull aching or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum 
Pain that spreads all over the groin, stomach area or lower back 
A change in color of the skin of the scrotum 
If an infection causes a scrotal mass, symptoms also might include 
Get a checkup even if you have a mass that isn t painful or tender 
See your child s pediatrician or other health care professional if 
Sometimes, a testicle doesn t move down from the stomach area into the scrotum before birth 
It might raise the risk of some scrotal masses later in life 
It often causes a painless lump or swelling in the scrotum 
But some people with testicular cancer don t have any symptoms 
This fluid filled sac in the scrotum is often above the testicle 
A spermatocele also is known as a spermatic cyst or epididymal cyst 
For instance, bacterial infections that spread through sex, such as chlamydia, can cause it 
This is when inflammation, which can include pain and swelling, affects the testicle 
Usually, it s due to an illness caused by a virus, most often mumps 
Most often, there s a small amount of fluid in this space 
Often, this is due to an injury or infection in the scrotum 
An injury, such as a direct hit to the testicles, is the most likely cause 
This happens when the veins inside the scrotum get bigger 
It might appear as a mass in the scrotum or higher in the groin 
This is a painful problem that cuts off blood to the testicle 
It happens due to a twisting of the spermatic cord 
Without prompt treatment, testicular torsion can lead to the loss of the testicle 
Risk factors Things that can raise the risk of a scrotal mass include 
Some people are born with irregular changes in the testicles, penis or kidneys 
These might raise the risk of a scrotal mass and testicular cancer later in life 
Having a parent or a sibling who s had testicular cancer also raises your risk 
Complications Not all scrotal masses lead to long term medical conditions 
But any mass that affects the health or function of the testicle can result in 
Sebaceous carcinoma may begin as a painless lump or thickening of skin on the eyelid 
Sebaceous carcinoma treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer 
Sebaceous carcinoma can grow quickly and sometimes spreads to other parts of the body 
Your health care provider will carefully inspect your skin to understand your condition 
The eye doctor will carefully check your eyelid and your eye 
Your provider will remove a small amount of tissue for testing 
Specialized lab tests can determine if cancer cells are present 
TreatmentSebaceous carcinoma treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer 
This makes it more likely that all of the cancer cells are removed during surgery 
After each layer of skin is removed, it s checked for signs of cancer 
It s the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures 
But people who have focal seizures may or may not lose consciousness 
In tonic clonic seizures, the muscles become stiff, causing the person to fall 
But sometimes this type of seizure can be triggered by other health problems 
Very low blood sugar, a high fever or a stroke can cause a tonic conic seizure 
Many people who have a tonic clonic seizure never have another one and don t need treatment 
The muscles suddenly contract and cause the person to fall down 
This phase tends to last about to seconds 
The following symptoms occur in some but not all people with tonic clonic seizures 
Some people may cry out at the beginning of a seizure 
The person may not become conscious for several minutes after convulsions have ended 
When to see a doctorCall or emergency medical help if 
If you experience a seizure for the first time, see a healthcare professional 
Also see a healthcare professional if you or your child 
Experience an increasing number of seizures for no apparent reason 
Many nerve cells fire at once, much faster than usual 
Exactly what causes the changes to occur often is not known 
However, tonic clonic seizures are sometimes caused by underlying health problems, such as 
Very low blood levels of glucose, sodium, calcium or magnesium 
Risk factors Risk factors for tonic clonic seizures include 
Any injury to the brain from trauma, a stroke, previous infection and other causes 
Complications Having a seizure at certain times can be dangerous for you or others 
If you have a seizure while swimming or bathing, you re at risk of accidental drowning 
And certain anti seizure medicines increase the risk of birth defects 
If you have epilepsy and plan to become pregnant, talk with a healthcare professional 
People with seizures are more likely to have depression and anxiety 
Overview Temporal lobe seizures begin in the temporal lobes of the brain 
These areas process emotions and are important for short term memory 
Symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure may be related to these functions 
Some people have odd feelings during the seizure, such as joy, deja vu or fear 
Temporal lobe seizures are sometimes called focal seizures with impaired awareness 
Some people remain aware of what s happening during the seizure 
The person s lips and hands may make motions over and over 
The cause of temporal lobe seizures is often not known 
But it may stem from a scar in the temporal lobe 
For some people who don t respond to medicine, surgery may be an option 
SymptomsAn unusual sensation known as an aura may happen before a temporal lobe seizure 
The aura is the first part of a focal seizure before a loss of consciousness 
A feeling that what s happening has happened before, known as deja vu 
A rising sensation in the belly similar to being on a roller coaster 
Sometimes temporal lobe seizures impair your ability to respond to others 
This type of temporal lobe seizure usually lasts seconds to minutes 
Not being aware of the people and things around you 
This type of seizure causes shaking, known as convulsions, and loss of consciousness 
Recovery is slower than usual after the seizure is over 
If you experience a seizure for the first time, see a health care provider 
You think you or your child has had a seizure 
Causes Often, the cause of temporal lobe seizures is not known 
But they can be a result of a number of factors, including 
A process that causes scarring in a part of the temporal lobe called the hippocampus 
During waking and sleeping, your brain cells produce varying electrical activity 
If there s a burst of electrical activity in many brain cells, a seizure may occur 
The loss of brain cells in the hippocampus may cause memory problems 
Overview A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled burst of electrical activity in the brain 
It can cause changes in behavior, movements, feelings and levels of consciousness 
There are many types of seizures, and they have a range of symptoms and severity 
Seizure types vary by where they begin in the brain and how far they spread 
A seizure that lasts longer than five minutes is a medical emergency 
Seizures can happen after a stroke or a head injury 
They also may be caused by an infection such as meningitis or another illness 
Jerking movements of the arms and legs that can t be controlled 
Health care professionals typically classify seizures as focal or generalized 
Seizures are classified based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure began 
Focal seizuresFocal seizures result from electrical activity in one area of the brain 
This type of seizure can occur with or without loss of consciousness 
They may not remember the seizure or even know that it occurred 
They also may change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound 
During these types of seizures, people may suddenly feel angry, joyful or sad 
Some people have nausea or unusual feelings that are hard to describe 
They also may cause sudden sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights 
Absence seizures, formerly known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children 
These seizures may happen up to hundreds of times a day 
They may occur in clusters and can cause a brief loss of awareness 
These seizures usually affect muscles in the back, arms and legs 
People who experience these seizures may lose consciousness and fall to the ground 
People having this type of seizure may suddenly fall down or drop their head 
These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body 
Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of the arms and legs 
They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking 
They sometimes cause people to lose control of their bladder or to bite their tongue 
Seizure stagesSeizures can have a beginning phase, middle phase and end phase 
During the prodrome, people may have a hard to describe sense that a seizure may happen 
This can happen in the hours or even days before a seizure 
Or people may simply feel strange, feel fear or panic, or even have pleasant feelings 
Symptoms also may include smells, sounds, tastes, blurred vision or racing thoughts 
The prodrome may include a headache, numbness or tingling, nausea, or dizziness 
The middle part of a seizure is called the ictal phase 
Symptoms of the ictal phase depend on the type of seizure 
They may feel sleepy, confused, dizzy, sad, scared, anxious or frustrated 
If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice 
Causes Nerve cells in the brain, known as neurons, create, send and receive electrical impulses 
Anything that disrupts the communication pathways can lead to a seizure 
Some types of seizures may be caused by genetic changes 
But not every person who has a seizure has epilepsy 
When this happens, the seizure is known as a febrile seizure 
Certain medicines that treat pain, depression or help people stop smoking 
It can cause bleeding in an area of the brain or a new stroke 
Alcohol misuse, including during times of withdrawal or extreme intoxication 
Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to people who are pregnant and their babies 
If you have epilepsy and plan to become pregnant, work with your health care professional 
Your care professional can adjust your medicines and monitor your pregnancy as needed 
People with seizures are more likely to have depression, anxiety or other emotional health issues 
Dealing with the condition and the side effects of anti seizure medicines can cause these issues 
Most people with selective IgA deficiency don t have recurrent infections 
Overview Separation anxiety is a normal stage of development for infants and toddlers 
Recurrent and excessive distress about anticipating or being away from home or loved ones 
Refusing to be away from home because of fear of separation 
Genetics may also play a role in developing the disorder 
Certain temperaments, which are more prone to anxiety disorders than others are 
Environmental issues, such as experiencing some type of disaster that involves separation 
Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce symptoms and prevent the disorder from getting worse 
Stick with the treatment plan to help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms 
The infection fighting processes turn on the body, causing the organs to work poorly 
When the damage is severe, it can lead to death 
When to see a doctorAny infection could lead to sepsis 
Symptoms such as confusion or fast breathing need emergency care 
Risk factors Some factors that increase the risk infection will lead to sepsis include 
People with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, kidney disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD 
A condition that requires treatment with corticosteroids, which can lower immune response 
The resulting small clots or burst blood vessels may damage or destroy tissues 
Also, an episode of severe sepsis raises the risk for future infections 
Ventricular septal defect VSD Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
It s a common heart problem present at birth congenital heart defect 
Oxygen rich blood gets pumped back to the lungs instead of out to the body 
Many small ventricular septal defects VSDs close on their own 
Babies with medium or larger VSDs may need surgery early in life to prevent complications 
Whooshing sound when listening to the heart with a stethoscope heart murmur 
Symptoms of a ventricular septal defect in adults may include 
When to see a doctorCall your health care provider if your baby 
Causes Ventricular septal defect VSD occurs as the baby s heart is developing during pregnancy 
VSDs can occur alone or with other heart problems present at birth 
The lungs pump the oxygen rich blood to the heart s left side 
A ventricular septal defect changes the direction of blood flow in the heart and lungs 
Risk factors Risk factors for ventricular septal defect include 
Family history of heart problems present at birth congenital heart defects 
A baby born with ventricular septal defect may have other heart problems, such as 
Complications A small ventricular septal defect VSD may never cause any problems 
An unrepaired hole in the heart can lead to this complication after many years 
Irregular blood flow causes the blood vessels in the lungs to become stiff and narrow 
This syndrome permanently damages the blood vessels in the lungs 
An infection causes life threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart s chambers and valves 
These include heart valve disease and irregular heart rhythms arrhythmias 
Also, be sure you talk to your doctor about any medications you re taking 
Avoid using illegal drugs as they may harm a developing baby 
Be sure you re up to date on all of your vaccinations before becoming pregnant 
Diabetes that develops during pregnancy gestational diabetes generally doesn t increase a baby s risk 
Tell your provider about all the medications you take, including those bought without a prescription 
Serotonin syndrome Overview Serotonin syndrome is a serious drug reaction 
It is caused by medications that build up high levels of serotonin in the body 
It s needed for the nerve cells and brain to function 
Some illicit drugs and dietary supplements are associated with serotonin syndrome 
If you have severe or rapidly worsening symptoms, seek emergency treatment immediately 
Causes Excessive accumulation of serotonin in the body creates the symptoms of serotonin syndrome 
Other nerve cells in the body, primarily in the intestines, also produce serotonin 
Serotonin plays a role in regulating the digestive process, blood flow and breathing 
For example, serotonin syndrome may occur if you take an antidepressant with a migraine medication 
It may also occur if you take an antidepressant with an opioid pain medication 
Another cause of serotonin syndrome is intentional overdose of antidepressant medications 
A number of over the counter and prescription drugs may be associated with serotonin syndrome, especially antidepressants 
Illicit drugs and dietary supplements also may be associated with the condition 
The drugs and supplements that could potentially cause serotonin syndrome include 
Bupropion Zyban, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL , an antidepressant and tobacco addiction medication 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAOIs , antidepressants such as isocarboxazid Marplan and phenelzine Nardil 
Anti nausea medications such as granisetron Sancuso, Sustol , metoclopramide Reglan , droperidol Inapsine and ondansetron Zofran 
Ritonavir Norvir , an anti retroviral medication used to treat human immunodeficiency virus HIV 
You take more than one drug known to increase serotonin levels 
You use an illicit drug known to increase serotonin levels 
If left untreated, severe serotonin syndrome can lead to unconsciousness and death 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS first appeared in China in November 
Within a few months, SARS spread worldwide, carried by unsuspecting travelers 
SARS showed how quickly infection can spread in a highly mobile and interconnected world 
When to see a doctorSARS is a serious illness that can lead to death 
Previously, these viruses had never been particularly dangerous to humans 
SARS is fatal in some cases, often due to respiratory failure 
If you have contact with the person s body fluids or feces, wear disposable gloves 
Throw the gloves away immediately after use and wash your hands thoroughly 
Wear disposable gloves while you clean and throw the gloves away when you re done 
Overview Sexually transmitted diseases STDs are caused by sexually transmitted infections STIs 
Sometimes sexually transmitted infections are spread in ways other than sexual contact 
For example, STIs can spread to infants during pregnancy or childbirth 
STIs also can spread through blood transfusions or shared needles 
SymptomsWhen to see a doctorSee a health care professional immediately if 
You are sexually active and may have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection 
When you re considering becoming sexually active or by age , whichever comes first 
Gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia are examples of STDs that are caused by bacteria 
Risk factors Anyone who is sexually active risks getting or spreading an STD 
Factors that may increase the risk of getting an sexually transmitted infection include 
Condoms made from natural membranes aren t recommended because they re not effective at preventing some STIs 
Not using condoms properly or not using them each time also can increase risk 
That is a thin, square piece of rubber made with latex or silicone 
The more people you have sexual activity with, the greater your risk 
Having one sexually transmitted infection makes it much easier for another STI to take hold 
Sharing a needle while injecting drugs can spread many serious infections 
Examples are human immunodeficiency virus HIV , hepatitis B and hepatitis C 
STIs in infants can cause serious problems or even death 
All pregnant women should be screened for STI infections and treated as needed 
Complications Many people in the early stages of an STD have no symptoms 
PreventionThere are many ways to avoid or lower your risk of getting an STD 
The most effective way to avoid STDs is to not have sex 
These barriers prevent skin to skin contact between the oral and genital mucous membranes 
Getting vaccinated before having sex can prevent certain types of sexually transmitted infections 
If you re under the influence of these substances, you re more likely to take sexual risks 
Before any sexual contact, talk to your partner about practicing safer sex 
Be sure you clearly agree on what activities will and won t be OK 
Male circumcision may also help prevent spread of genital HPV and genital herpes 
These medicines must be taken every day, exactly as prescribed 
Your health care professional also will test your kidney function before prescribing Truvada 
They will then test your kidney function every six months 
But Descovy hasn t been studied in people who have receptive vaginal sex 
This form of child abuse can cause permanent brain damage or death 
Help is available for parents who are at risk of harming a child 
Parents also can educate other caregivers about the dangers of shaken baby syndrome 
Many children with shaken baby syndrome show signs and symptoms of prior child abuse 
Call or emergency medical help, or take your child to the nearest emergency room 
Getting medical care right away may save your child s life or prevent serious health problems 
Causes Babies have weak neck muscles and can t support the weight of their heads 
Also, men are more likely to cause shaken baby syndrome than are women 
Complications Even brief shaking of an infant can cause irreversible brain damage 
Survivors of shaken baby syndrome may require lifelong medical care for conditions such as 
Cerebral palsy, a disorder that affects movement and muscle coordination 
If you re having trouble managing your emotions or the stress of parenthood, seek help 
Your child s doctor may offer a referral to a counselor or other mental health provider 
The main sign of shigella infection is diarrhea, which often is bloody 
A mild case usually clears up on its own within a week 
But it may take up to a week to develop 
Some people have no symptoms after they ve been infected with shigella 
However, their feces may still be contagious up to a few weeks 
Direct person to person contact is the most common way the disease is spread 
Infected people who handle food can spread the bacteria to people who eat the food 
Children under age are most likely to get shigella infection 
Close contact with other people spreads the bacteria from person to person 
People who live or travel in developing countries are more likely to get shigella infection 
But it may take weeks or months before your bowel habits return to normal 
If your child has a seizure, contact your doctor immediately 
Signs and symptoms include stomach pain and swelling, fever and weakness 
PreventionAlthough researchers continue to work to develop a shigella vaccine, nothing is available yet 
Wash hands with soap and water for at least seconds frequently 
Keep children with diarrhea home from child care, play groups or school 
Avoid sexual activity with anyone who has diarrhea or who recently recovered from diarrhea 
Portions of the small intestine are missing or damaged at birth 
Short bowel syndrome treatment typically involves special diets and nutritional supplements 
It may involve receiving nutrition through a vein, called parenteral nutrition, to prevent malnutrition 
The condition often accompanies other immune system disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus 
Your eyes might burn, itch or feel gritty as if there s sand in them 
Some people with Sjogren s syndrome also have one or more of the following 
Your immune system mistakenly attacks your body s own cells and tissues 
In Sjogren s syndrome, your immune system first targets the glands that make tears and saliva 
But it can also damage other parts of your body, such as 
Sjogren s syndrome is usually diagnosed in people older than 
Complications The most common complications of Sjogren s syndrome involve your eyes and mouth 
Dry eyes can lead to light sensitivity, blurred vision and corneal damage 
A small percentage of people with Sjogren s syndrome develop cancer of the lymph nodes lymphoma 
You might develop numbness, tingling and burning in your hands and feet peripheral neuropathy 
Stevens Johnson syndrome is a medical emergency that usually requires hospitalization 
A more severe form of the condition is called toxic epidermal necrolysis TEN 
Blisters on your skin and the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, eyes and genitals 
When to see a doctorStevens Johnson syndrome requires immediate medical attention 
Seek emergency medical care if you experience signs and symptoms of this condition 
Medications to treat seizures and mental illness anticonvulsants and antipsychotics 
The immune system can be affected by an organ transplant, HIV AIDS and autoimmune diseases 
People with cancer, particularly blood cancer, are at increased risk of Stevens Johnson syndrome 
And sores in the mouth and throat can make fluid intake difficult, resulting in dehydration 
Sepsis is a rapidly progressing, life threatening condition that can cause shock and organ failure 
In severe cases, it can lead to visual impairment and, rarely, blindness 
If you ve had this condition, avoid the medication that triggered it 
If you think you might have sleep apnea, see your health care provider 
Treatment can ease your symptoms and might help prevent heart problems and other complications 
The most common symptoms of obstructive and central sleep apneas include 
Talk to your health care provider if you have symptoms of sleep apnea 
Ask your provider about any sleep problem that leaves you fatigued, sleepy and irritable 
When the muscles relax, your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in 
You can t get enough air, which can lower the oxygen level in your blood 
This pattern can repeat itself to times or more each hour, all night 
This makes it hard to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep 
This means that you make no effort to breathe for a short period 
Risk factors Sleep apnea can affect anyone, even children 
Obstructive sleep apneaFactors that increase the risk of this form of sleep apnea include 
Fat deposits around your upper airway can obstruct your breathing 
Tonsils or adenoids also can enlarge and block the airway, particularly in children 
Men are to times more likely to have sleep apnea than are women 
However, women increase their risk if they re overweight or if they ve gone through menopause 
Having family members with sleep apnea might increase your risk 
These substances relax the muscles in your throat, which can worsen obstructive sleep apnea 
Smoking can increase the amount of inflammation and fluid retention in the upper airway 
Central sleep apneaRisk factors for this form of sleep apnea include 
Middle aged and older people have a higher risk of central sleep apnea 
Central sleep apnea is more common in men than it is in women 
Opioid medicines, especially long acting ones such as methadone, increase the risk of central sleep apnea 
Having had a stroke increases the risk of central sleep apnea 
People with sleep apnea have an increased risk of motor vehicle and workplace accidents 
Children and adolescents with sleep apnea might perform poorly in school or have behavior problems 
Having OSA increases your risk of high blood pressure, also known as hypertension 
Having sleep apnea increases your risk of developing insulin resistance and type diabetes 
Obstructive sleep apnea is also a concern with certain medicines and general anesthesia 
Loud snoring can keep anyone who sleeps nearby from getting good rest 
The repeated awakening associated with sleep apnea makes typical, restorative sleep impossible 
Overview Sleep disorders are conditions that result in changes in the way that you sleep 
A sleep disorder can affect your overall health, safety and quality of life 
Other signs and symptoms include an irregular sleep and wake cycle and difficulty falling asleep 
They re often grouped into categories that explain why they happen or how they affect you 
Insomnia, in which you have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep throughout the night 
Sleep apnea, in which you experience abnormal patterns in breathing while you are asleep 
Restless legs syndrome RLS , a type of sleep movement disorder 
Doctors can usually treat most sleep disorders effectively once they re correctly diagnosed 
Some people may fall asleep at inappropriate times, such as while driving 
Unusual or bothersome movements or experiences during sleep are also possible 
Having an irregular sleep and wake cycle is another symptom of sleep disorders 
Also known as night terrors, sleep terrors may lead to sleepwalking 
Parasomnias are disturbing or strange behaviors or experiences during sleep 
Sleep terrors may happen in children between the ages of and years 
The person who has a nightmare wakes up from the dream and may remember details 
Children usually don t remember anything about their sleep terrors in the morning 
Adults may recall part of a dream they had during the sleep terrors 
Sleep terrors generally happen in the first part of sleep time, and rarely during naps 
Sweat, breathe heavily, and have a racing pulse, flushed face and enlarged pupils 
Be hard to wake up and be confused if awakened 
Have no or little memory of the event the next morning 
When to see a doctorOccasional sleep terrors aren t usually a cause for concern 
Regularly disrupt the sleep of the person with sleep terrors or other family members 
Result in daytime symptoms of extreme sleepiness or problems with daily activities 
Continue beyond the teen years or start as an adult 
A parasomnia is a disturbing or strange behavior or experience during sleep 
People who have sleep terrors don t completely wake up from sleep during the episodes 
Their appearance may suggest they are awake, but they remain partially asleep 
Sleep terrors sometimes can be triggered by conditions that interfere with sleep, such as 
The most common type of sleep disordered breathing is obstructive sleep apnea 
Complications Some complications that may result from sleep terrors include 
Injury to the person having a sleep terror or, rarely, to someone nearby 
More common in children than adults, sleepwalking is usually outgrown by the teen years 
Isolated incidents of sleepwalking often don t signal any serious problems or require treatment 
Sit up in bed and open his or her eyes 
Be disoriented or confused for a short time after being awakened 
Have problems functioning during the day because of disturbed sleep 
Do routine activities, such as getting dressed, talking or eating 
Engage in unusual behavior, such as urinating in a closet 
Get injured, for example, by falling down the stairs or jumping out a window 
Become violent during the period of brief confusion immediately after waking or, occasionally, during sleepwalking 
You can simply mention the sleepwalking at a routine physical or well child exam 
Lead to dangerous behavior or injury to the person who sleepwalks or to others 
Cause significant sleep disruption to household members or the person who sleepwalks 
Result in daytime symptoms of excessive sleepiness or problems functioning 
Causes Sleepwalking is classified as a parasomnia an undesirable behavior or experience during sleep 
Another NREM disorder is sleep terrors, which can occur together with sleepwalking 
Sometimes sleepwalking can by triggered by underlying conditions that interfere with sleep, such as 
Taking certain medications, such as hypnotics, sedatives or certain medications used for psychiatric disorders 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of sleepwalking include 
Complications Sleepwalking itself isn t necessarily a concern, but a person who sleepwalks can 
The small intestine digests and absorbs nutrients from the foods you eat 
The small intestine also plays a role in the body s germ fighting immune system 
It contains cells that fight bacteria and viruses that enter the body through the mouth 
Small bowel cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer 
Other treatments include chemotherapy and targeted therapy, which use medicines to kill cancer cells 
Radiation therapy also may be used to shrink the cancer before surgery 
Blood in the stool, which might look red or black 
Small bowel cancer happens when cells develop changes in their DNA 
Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of small bowel cancer 
Neuroendocrine tumors are cancers that start in the neuroendocrine cells 
Most lymphomas in the small bowel are a type of non Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that start in the body s connective tissues 
One type of soft tissue sarcoma is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, also known as GIST 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of small bowel cancer include 
Examples include Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, also called FAP, and Peutz Jeghers syndrome 
These may include Crohn s disease, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease 
Advanced small bowel cancer can spread to other parts of the body 
PreventionIt s not clear what may help to reduce the risk of small bowel cancer 
If you re interested in reducing your risk of cancer in general, it may help to 
Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get different vitamins and nutrients 
Talk to a health care professional about ways to quit that may work for you 
Also, talk to your health care team before starting any exercise program 
The word prolapse means to slip or fall out of place 
To manage small bowel prolapse, self care measures and other nonsurgical options are often effective 
In severe cases, you may need surgery to fix the prolapse 
SymptomsMild small bowel prolapse may produce no signs or symptoms 
A pulling sensation in your pelvis that eases when you lie down 
Pregnancy and childbirthPregnancy and childbirth are the most common causes of pelvic organ prolapse 
Not everyone who has had a baby develops pelvic organ prolapse 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing small bowel prolapse include 
Women who have only cesarean deliveries are less likely to develop prolapse 
Other factors that increase pressure include ongoing chronic cough and straining during bowel movements 
Smoking is associated with developing prolapse because smokers frequently cough, increasing abdominal pressure 
PreventionYou may be able to lower your chances of small bowel prolapse with these strategies 
If you re overweight, losing some weight can decrease the pressure inside your abdomen 
See your doctor to ask about treatment if you have an ongoing chronic cough 
Overview Smallpox is a serious and often deadly viral infection 
The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was reported in 
Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes 
And scientific advances have made it possible to create smallpox in a lab 
This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a bioweapon 
New antiviral medications can be used to treat people who develop smallpox 
A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body 
Scabs form to days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars 
You can catch the smallpox virus by being around someone who has it 
An infected person can spread the virus when they cough, sneeze or talk 
Coming in contact with skin sores also can cause you to get smallpox 
Smallpox can also spread through contact with contaminated clothing and bedding 
However, some rare types of smallpox are almost always deadly 
These more severe forms are most common in pregnant women and children 
Anyone who had contact with someone who had smallpox would need a smallpox vaccine 
The vaccine should be given before or one week after exposure to the virus 
The ACAM vaccine uses a live virus that s like smallpox, but less harmful 
It can sometimes cause serious side effects, such as infections in the heart or brain 
In addition, snoring can be a nuisance to your partner 
In addition, medical devices and surgery are available that may reduce disruptive snoring 
However, these aren t suitable or necessary for everyone who snores 
SymptomsSnoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea OSA 
Your snoring is so loud it s disrupting your partner s sleep 
In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school 
This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night 
When to see a doctorSee your doctor if you have any of the above symptoms 
These may indicate your snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnea OSA 
The more narrowed your airway, the more forceful the airflow becomes 
This increases tissue vibration, which causes your snoring to grow louder 
The following conditions can affect the airway and cause snoring 
Having a low, thick soft palate can narrow your airway 
Snoring can also be brought on by consuming too much alcohol before bedtime 
Alcohol relaxes throat muscles and decreases your natural defenses against airway obstruction 
Not getting enough sleep can lead to further throat relaxation 
Risk factors Risk factors that may contribute to snoring include 
Men are more likely to snore or have sleep apnea than are women 
Alcohol relaxes your throat muscles, increasing the risk of snoring 
Having a family history of snoring or obstructive sleep apnea 
Complications Habitual snoring may be more than just a nuisance 
A greater risk of high blood pressure, heart conditions and stroke 
An increased risk of motor vehicle accidents due to lack of sleep 
Soft palate cancer is considered a type of throat cancer 
It is treated similarly to the way other types of throat cancers are treated 
This may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of soft palate cancer can include the following 
It s not always clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to soft palate cancer 
For some soft palate cancers, human papillomavirus is thought to have a part 
HPV is a common virus that s transmitted through sexual contact 
For others, it causes changes in the cells that may one day lead to cancer 
Risk factors Things that may increase the risk of soft palate cancer include 
Using tobaccoAll forms of tobacco increase the risk of soft palate cancer 
Drinking alcoholFrequent and heavy drinking increases the risk of soft palate cancer 
PreventionWays to reduce your risk of soft palate cancer include 
Limit alcohol intakeIf you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation 
Ask your doctor or other healthcare professional whether an HIV vaccine is appropriate for you 
Solitary fibrous tumors that happen in the pleura are called pleural solitary fibrous tumors 
Symptoms depend on where the tumor is in the body 
If it s in the lungs, symptoms might include cough and shortness of breath 
DiagnosisTests and procedures used to diagnose solitary fibrous tumor include 
Testing is done by doctors who specialize in analyzing blood and body tissue, called pathologists 
Most often, surgery is the only treatment needed for solitary fibrous tumors 
Surgeons remove the tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue around it 
Radiation might be used after surgery if all of the tumor can t be removed 
It might lower the risk that the tumor will come back after surgery 
Sometimes radiation is used before surgery to shrink the tumor 
This might make it more likely that the tumor is removed completely 
By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can kill tumor cells 
If you have somatic symptom disorder, you may experience significant emotional and physical distress 
Treatment can help ease symptoms, help you cope and improve your quality of life 
Viewing normal physical sensations as a sign of severe physical illness 
Fearing that symptoms are serious, even when there is no evidence 
Feeling that medical evaluation and treatment have not been adequate 
Fearing that physical activity may cause damage to your body 
Frequent health care visits that don t relieve your concerns or that make them worse 
Being unresponsive to medical treatment or unusually sensitive to medication side effects 
Having a more severe impairment than is usually expected from a medical condition 
Symptoms cause very real distress for the person and reassurance isn t always helpful 
Genetic and biological factors, such as an increased sensitivity to pain 
Family influence, which may be genetic or environmental, or both 
Risk factors Risk factors for somatic symptom disorder include 
Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression and personality disorders 
PreventionLittle is known about how to prevent somatic symptom disorder 
If you have problems with anxiety or depression, seek professional help as soon as possible 
They also can affect how you act at work or school, or in social situations 
It s common to have a specific phobia about more than one object or situation 
Specific phobias also can happen along with other types of anxiety disorders 
Situations, such as airplanes, driving, enclosed spaces or going to school 
Blood, shots or injuries, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures 
Others, such as choking, throwing up, loud noises or clowns 
Phobia comes from the Greek word phobos, which means fear 
Have physical reactions and feelings, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or trouble breathing 
Feel like throwing up, or you get dizzy or faint, especially around blood or injuries 
But it is not a specific phobia unless it seriously disrupts your life 
And the sooner you ask for help, the more likely that therapy will be effective 
Causes Much is still not known about what causes specific phobias 
This could be due to a blend of genetics and learned behaviors 
Risk factors These factors may increase your risk of specific phobias 
Specific phobias can first appear when you re a child, typically by age 
This could be something passed down to you from a blood relative 
Avoidance is the most common way people cope with phobias 
These phobias can cause problems that affect many areas of life 
Children with these disorders are at risk of problems at school and loneliness 
Many people with specific phobias have depression and other anxiety disorders 
Some people with specific phobias may be at risk of suicide 
Sometimes this leads to others becoming too protective over the person with anxiety 
Spider bites Overview Spider bites are usually harmless, and spiders don t usually bite unless threatened 
Many other bug bites and skin sores cause redness, pain and swelling 
Many skin sores look the same but have other causes, such as a bacterial infection 
Widow spider bitesSigns and symptoms of a widow spider bite can include 
You might experience nausea, vomiting, tremors or sweating alone or in combination 
Recluse spider bitesSigns and symptoms of a recluse spider bite can include 
Increasing pain over the first eight hours after the bite 
You were bitten by a dangerous spider, such as a widow or recluse 
You re unsure whether the bite was from a dangerous spider 
You have severe pain, abdominal cramping or a growing wound at the bite site 
The area of the sore has spreading redness or red streaks 
Widow spiders and recluse spiders like warm climates and dark, dry places 
They are more active in the warmer months and prefer to live in 
These spiders are so named because they like to hide away in undisturbed areas 
PreventionSpiders usually bite only in defense, when being trapped between your skin and another object 
Learn what dangerous spiders look like and their preferred habitats 
Inspect and shake out gardening gloves, boots and clothing before use 
Don t store items under the bed and don t let bedding drag on the floor 
When cleaning tarantula enclosures, wear gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection 
This affects the spinal cord and bones of the spine 
Spina bifida can range from being mild to causing serious disabilities 
Symptoms also depend on whether the spinal cord and nerves are involved 
Spina bifida occulta is the mildest and most common type 
Many people who have spina bifida occulta don t know they have it 
The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back 
In this type, a sac of spinal fluid bulges through an opening in the spine 
No nerves are affected and the spinal cord isn t in the fluid sac 
SymptomsSymptoms of spina bifida vary by type and from one person to another 
Typically, there aren t any symptoms of spina bifida occulta because the spinal nerves aren t involved 
You might see a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark 
Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac 
Babies with this type of spina bifida may have trouble with bladder and bowel function 
They also may experience weakness or lack of movement in the legs 
Families can be educated on the different complications to watch for 
Children with spina bifida occulta typically don t have symptoms or complications 
In these children, usually only routine pediatric care is needed 
It s thought that a combination of genetic, nutritional and environmental risk factors causes the condition 
Risk factors Spina bifida is more common among Hispanic people and white people 
Also, female babies are affected more often than male babies 
Folic acid is the synthetic form that s found in supplements and fortified foods 
If folate levels are too low, it s known as a deficiency 
The risk increases even more if two previous children have been affected by the condition 
If you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your healthcare professional 
Also tell your healthcare professional about all of the medicines you take 
Complications Spina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or it can lead to more serious physical conditions 
The size and location of the opening in the spine 
Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord 
A number of complications may affect children with spina bifida 
Sometimes it can cause loss of movement, known as paralysis 
Ability to walk also depends on the care received before and after birth 
The complications depend on the location of the spine that s affected 
Changes that aren t typical, such as an inward facing foot, known as clubfoot 
Nerves that supply the bladder and bowel usually don t work properly in children with myelomeningocele 
As a result, they can t control their bowel or bladder 
Babies born with myelomeningocele commonly have a buildup of fluid in the brain 
Shunts placed in the brain to treat hydrocephalus can stop working or become infected 
Some of the warning symptoms of a shunt that isn t working include 
Changes in the eyes, such as a fixed downward gaze 
Chiari malformation kee AH ree mal for MAY shun type is common in children who have myelomeningocele 
The brainstem is the lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord 
This can cause arm weakness and trouble with breathing and swallowing 
Rarely, this condition can cause compression on this area of the brain 
Infection in the tissues surrounding the brain, known as meningitis 
Some babies with myelomeningocele may develop an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain 
A tethered spinal cord is when the spinal nerves attach to tissue and stretch 
This can happen with scar tissue that resulted from surgery 
When a spinal cord is tethered, it s less able to grow as the child grows 
It can lead to loss of muscle function in the legs, bowel or bladder 
Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of developing wounds in casts 
A latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose 
Other medical issues may arise as children with spina bifida get older 
These complications may include urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal GI conditions and depression 
They may have trouble paying attention and learning reading and math 
But many people don t discover that they re pregnant until this time 
Vitamin supplements that include folic acid are necessary to prevent spina bifida 
These conditions include a cleft lip, a cleft palate and some heart conditions 
Check with your healthcare professional before taking additional folic acid supplements 
Without treatment, this rare condition can permanently damage the spinal cord 
The spinal cord uses the oxygen from the blood in the capillaries 
The cells in the spinal tissue can weaken or die 
You might not know you have a spinal AVM unless you begin experiencing symptoms 
SymptomsSymptoms of spinal AVM can differ from person to person 
Symptoms depend on where the AVM is found and how severe it is 
Some people may not notice symptoms for many years, if at all 
As the condition gets worse, you may have more symptoms including 
Most spinal AVMs are present at birth congenital , but others may happen later in life 
Risk factors There are no known risk factors for spinal arteriovenous malformation 
Complications Without treatment, spinal arteriovenous malformation can cause disability that gets worse over time 
This is from damage to the spinal cord and surrounding tissues 
A tumor that affects the bones of the spine vertebrae is called a vertebral tumor 
A spinal tumor can be life threatening and cause permanent disability 
Treatment for a spinal tumor may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or other medications 
Find out why Mayo Clinic is the best place for your care 
SymptomsSpinal cord tumors can cause different signs and symptoms, especially as tumors grow 
Pain at the site of the tumor due to tumor growth 
Back pain, often radiating to other parts of your body 
Loss of sensation or muscle weakness, especially in your arms or legs 
Muscle weakness, which may be mild or severe, in different parts of your body 
Back pain is a common early symptom of spinal tumors 
Spinal tumors progress at different rates depending on the type of tumor 
You have a history of cancer and develop new back pain 
You have other symptoms of cancer, such as nausea, vomiting or dizziness 
Progressive muscle weakness or numbness in your legs or arms 
They might be caused by something in the environment, such as exposure to certain chemicals 
Risk factors Spinal cord tumors are more common in people who have 
In this hereditary disorder, benign tumors develop on or near the nerves related to hearing 
This may lead to progressive hearing loss in one or both ears 
Some people with neurofibromatosis also develop spinal canal tumors 
This can sometimes cause changes in bowel and bladder function 
Overview Spinal stenosis happens when the space inside the backbone is too small 
This can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves that travel through the spine 
Spinal stenosis occurs most often in the lower back and the neck 
People who have severe cases of spinal stenosis may need surgery 
This can ease the symptoms caused by pressure on the spinal cord or nerves 
But surgery can t cure arthritis, so arthritis pain in the spine may continue 
When symptoms do occur, they start slowly and get worse over time 
Symptoms depend on which part of the spine is affected 
This happens when you stand for a long time or when you walk 
Tingling or weakness in a hand, leg, foot or arm 
Causes Spinal bones are stacked in a column from the skull to the tailbone 
They protect the spinal cord, which runs through an opening called the spinal canal 
Wear and tear damage from arthritis can cause extra bone to grow on the spine 
Paget s disease also can cause extra bone to grow on the spine 
Disks are the soft cushions that act as shock absorbers between your spinal bones 
Risk factors Most people with spinal stenosis are over age 
The most common location for a sprain is in your ankle 
Hearing or feeling a pop in your joint at the time of injury 
When to see the doctorMild sprains can be treated at home 
But the injuries that cause sprains can also cause serious injuries, such as fractures 
Have pain directly over the bones of an injured joint 
Ankle Walking or exercising on an uneven surface, landing awkwardly from a jump 
Wrist Landing on an outstretched hand during a fall 
Thumb Skiing injury or overextension when playing racquet sports, such as tennis 
Children have areas of softer tissue, called growth plates, near the ends of their bones 
Slippery or uneven surfaces can make you more prone to injury 
Tired muscles are less likely to provide good support for your joints 
If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries 
The best brace you can give yourself is your own muscle brace 
Overview Stuttering is a speech condition that disrupts the normal flow of speech 
Fluency means having an easy and smooth flow and rhythm when speaking 
With stuttering, the interruptions in flow happen often and cause problems for the speaker 
Other names for stuttering are stammering and childhood onset fluency disorder 
Stuttering is common among young children as a usual part of learning to speak 
Most children outgrow this type of stuttering, called developmental stuttering 
But sometimes stuttering is a long term condition that remains into adulthood 
This type of stuttering can affect self esteem and communicating with other people 
Having a hard time starting a word, phrase or sentence 
Brief silence for certain syllables or words, or pausing before or within a word 
But stuttering that continues may need treatment to improve speech fluency 
Or you can contact the speech language pathologist directly for an appointment 
Happens more often or continues as the child grows older 
Includes muscle tightening or physically struggling when trying to speak 
Affects the ability to effectively communicate at school or work or in social situations 
Causes Researchers continue to study the underlying causes of developmental stuttering 
Developmental stutteringStuttering that happens in children while they re learning to speak is called developmental stuttering 
Speech fluency can be disrupted during times of emotional distress 
These situations also may cause speakers who stutter to have greater problems with fluency 
Risk factors Males are much more likely to stutter than females are 
This is true for children with other speech problems too 
Stress in the family and other types of stress or pressure can worsen existing stuttering 
Not speaking or staying away from situations that require speaking 
Not taking part in social, school or work activities and opportunities for success 
Staph infections Overview Staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria 
Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or cause relatively minor skin infections 
A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life threatening staph infections 
Treatment usually involves antibiotics and cleaning of the infected area 
However, some staph infections no longer respond, or become resistant, to common antibiotics 
SymptomsStaph infections can range from minor skin problems to life threatening illness 
The most common type of staph infection is the boil 
This is a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland 
The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen 
If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus 
Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks 
This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria 
Impetigo usually has large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey colored crust 
Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin 
It causes redness and swelling on the surface of your skin 
Toxins produced by the staph bacteria may cause staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome 
Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition includes a fever, a rash and sometimes blisters 
When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off 
This leaves a red, raw surface that looks like a burn 
Food poisoningStaph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning 
The bacteria multiply in food and produce toxins that make you sick 
Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food 
Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day 
A staph infection in food usually doesn t cause a fever 
Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include 
BacteremiaAlso known as a bloodstream infection, bacteremia occurs when staph bacteria enter the bloodstream 
A fever and low blood pressure are signs of bacteremia 
The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body to cause infections that affect 
Internal organs, such as your brain meningitis , heart endocarditis or lungs pneumonia 
Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers 
Toxic shock syndromeThis life threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria 
The condition has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery 
A rash on your palms and soles that looks like a sunburn 
Septic arthritisSeptic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection 
The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes 
You may also want to talk to your provider if 
Skin infections are being passed from one family member to another 
Two or more family members have skin infections at the same time 
Staph bacteria can also be spread from person to person 
Staph bacteria can make you sick by causing an infection 
You can also become sick from the toxins produced by the bacteria 
People who may be more likely to get a staph infection include those with 
Weakened immune systems either from a disease or medications that suppress the immune system 
Cancer, especially those who are being treated with chemotherapy or radiation 
Invasive and implanted devicesStaph bacteria can get into the body by traveling along medical tubing 
These devices make a connection between the outside and the inside of your body 
Contact sportsStaph bacteria can spread easily through cuts, scrapes and skin to skin contact 
The bacteria multiply in the food and produce toxins that make you sick 
Foods that are contaminated with staph bacteria do not look or taste differently 
This is a life threatening episode when your blood pressure drops to an extremely low level 
PreventionThese commonsense precautions can help lower your risk of getting staph infections 
Wash your hands with soap and water briskly for at least seconds 
Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with sterile, dry bandages until they heal 
Keeping wounds covered will help keep the bacteria from spreading 
Tampons left in for long periods can grow staph bacteria 
Avoid sharing personal items such as towels, sheets, razors, clothing and athletic equipment 
Staph infections can spread on objects, as well as from person to person 
Make sure that cold foods stay at F C or below 
Overview Trigger finger makes a finger get stuck in a bent position 
The condition is most common in women over the age of 
Treatment of trigger finger can include splinting, steroid injections or surgery 
SymptomsSymptoms of trigger finger may progress from mild to severe and include 
Tenderness or a bump in the palm at the base of the affected finger 
Finger catching or locking in a bent position, which suddenly pops straight 
Causes Tendons are tough cords that attach muscle to bone 
Trigger finger occurs when the affected finger s tendon sheath becomes irritated and swollen 
This makes it harder for the tendon to glide through the sheath 
In most people, there s no explanation for why this irritation and swelling begins 
The nodule can make it even harder for the tendon to glide smoothly 
Risk factors Factors that put you at risk of developing trigger finger include 
People who have diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis are at higher risk of developing trigger finger 
It also can affect your ability to grip a steering wheel or grasp tools 
Strep throat accounts for only a small portion of sore throats 
If untreated, strep throat can cause complications, such as kidney inflammation or rheumatic fever 
Strep throat is most common in children, but it affects people of all ages 
Red and swollen tonsils, sometimes with white patches or streaks of pus 
That s why your doctor generally tests specifically for strep throat 
If strep has been diagnosed, a lack of improvement after taking antibiotics for hours 
Risk factors Several factors can increase your risk of strep throat infection 
Although strep throat can occur anytime, it tends to circulate in winter and early spring 
Strep bacteria flourish wherever groups of people are in close contact 
Scarlet fever, a streptococcal infection characterized by a prominent rash 
Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis, a condition that causes inflammation of the joints 
Proper hand washing is the best way to prevent all kinds of infections 
Wash dishes in hot, soapy water or in a dishwasher 
Stress incontinence is not the same as urgency incontinence and overactive bladder OAB 
Stress incontinence is much more common in women than in men 
Treatment can help you manage stress incontinence and improve your quality of life 
SymptomsIf you have stress incontinence, you may leak urine when you 
You might not leak urine every time you do one of these things 
But any activity that puts pressure on your bladder can make leaking more likely 
Causes Stress incontinence happens when certain muscles and other tissues linked to urinating weaken 
This keeps you from leaking urine until you reach a bathroom 
Sneezing, bending over, lifting or laughing hard, for instance, can cause urine leakage 
Stress incontinence from this damage may begin soon after delivery or happen years later 
Treatment for prostate cancer often involves surgery to remove the prostate gland, called a prostatectomy 
This surgery is the most common factor leading to stress incontinence 
Other factorsOther factors that can make stress incontinence worse for males and females include 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of getting stress incontinence include 
People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of stress incontinence 
Excess weight increases pressure on the abdominal and pelvic organs 
It can disrupt your work, social life, relationships and even your sex life 
Some people are ashamed that they need pads or incontinence garments 
It s common to have both stress incontinence and urgency incontinence 
Urinary incontinence results when bladder muscles tighten and cause an urgent need to urinate 
Prolonged contact with urine can cause skin to be sore or to break down 
This can happen with severe incontinence if you don t use moisture barriers or incontinence pads 
Change pads often and use continence pads rather than menstrual pads to prevent skin sores 
They re common in pregnant women, especially during the last trimester 
Causes The cause of stretch marks is stretching of the skin 
Your level of the hormone cortisol also might play a role 
Having a genetic disorder such as Cushing syndrome or Marfan syndrome 
Some people describe it as the worst headache they have ever felt 
Untreated, a subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to permanent brain damage or death 
You may save a life your own or someone else s 
But you can take steps to stay safe and start enjoying your life again 
Withdrawing from social contact and wanting to be left alone 
Having mood swings, such as being emotionally high one day and deeply discouraged the next 
Doing risky or self destructive things, such as using drugs or driving recklessly 
Saying goodbye to people as if they won t be seen again 
Warning signs aren t always obvious, and they may vary from person to person 
Some people make their intentions clear, while others keep suicidal thoughts and feelings secret 
Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone in your faith community 
Make an appointment with your doctor, other health care provider or a mental health professional 
Have suicidal thoughts and have access to firearms in your home 
Have an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as major depression, post traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder 
Are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender with an unsupportive family or in a hostile environment 
Children and teenagersSuicide in children and teenagers can follow stressful life events 
Physical or medical issues, for example, becoming pregnant or having a sexually transmitted infection 
Reading or hearing an account of suicide or knowing a peer who died by suicide 
Known as a homicide suicide or murder suicide, some risk factors include 
Complications Suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide take an emotional toll 
If you don t treat the underlying cause, your suicidal thoughts are likely to return 
Take one step at a time and don t act impulsively 
Polymorphous light eruption is the most common form of sun allergy 
Other types of sun related reactions occur for reasons that are unclear 
Severe rashes may be treated with steroid creams or pills 
If you have severe sun allergy, you may need to take preventive steps 
For example, wear clothing that shields you from the sun 
Symptoms show up within minutes to hours after sun exposure 
It isn t clear why some people have a sun allergy and others don t 
Risk factors Risk factors for having an allergic reaction to sunlight include 
Having dermatitis increases your risk of having a sun allergy 
If you can t do that, limit the time you re in the sun 
Symptoms occur when daylight hours get longer and people are exposed to more sunlight 
Long sleeved shirts and wide brimmed hats can help protect your skin from sun exposure 
Physical blockers provide the most effective protection for sensitive skin 
Check sunscreen labels for directions on storing and expiration dates 
Throw away sunscreen if it s expired or more than years old 
Put a UV blocking film on the windows of your home and car 
Overview Sunburn is inflamed, painful skin that feels hot to the touch 
It often appears within a few hours of being in the sun too long 
But it may take days for the sunburn to fade 
Preventing sunburn year round by wearing sunscreen or using other skin protection habits is important for everyone 
It is especially important when you re outdoors, even on cool or cloudy days 
Headache, fever, nausea and fatigue, if the sunburn is severe 
The eyes, which are extremely sensitive to the sun s UV light, also can burn 
Sunburn symptoms often appear within a few hours after sun exposure 
Any lingering changes in skin color usually go away with time 
Show signs of infection, such as blisters with pus or streaks 
Seek immediate medical care if you are sunburned and experience 
Causes Sunburn is caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet UV light 
UVB is the wavelength of light that penetrates the skin more superficially and causes sunburn 
Surfaces such as snow, sand and water can reflect UV rays and burn skin too 
Risk factors Risk factors for sunburn include 
Living or vacationing somewhere sunny, warm or at high altitude 
Taking a drug that makes you more likely to burn photosensitizing medication 
These include premature aging of skin photoaging , precancerous skin lesions and skin cancer 
Premature aging of your skinSun exposure and repeated sunburns speed the skin s aging process 
Weakening of connective tissues, which reduces the skin s strength and elasticity 
They re also called actinic keratoses ak TIN ik ker uh TOE seez and solar keratoses 
Sunburns in childhood and adolescence may increase the risk of melanoma later in life 
With melanoma, an existing mole may change, or a new, suspicious looking mole may grow 
A change in the look or texture of a mole 
Sun damage to the lens can lead to clouding of the lens cataracts 
PreventionUse these methods to prevent sunburn, even on cool, cloudy or hazy days 
Sun exposure on cloudy days is decreased by about 
Be extra careful around water, snow, concrete and sand because they reflect the sun s rays 
In addition, UV light is more intense at high altitudes 
Getting a base tan doesn t decrease your risk of sunburn 
Broad spectrum products offer protection against ultraviolet A UVA and ultraviolet B UVB rays 
No sunscreen can block of the sun s UVB rays 
About minutes before going outdoors, generously apply your sunscreen to clean, dry skin 
Don t use a spray product while smoking or near an open flame 
Reapply sunscreen every two hours or more often if you re swimming or perspiring 
Throw away sunscreen if it s expired or more than three years old 
Consider using outdoor gear specially designed to provide sun protection 
Check the UV rating on the label when buying new glasses 
Some common prescription and nonprescription drugs can make skin more sensitive to sunlight 
Overview Supraventricular tachycardia SVT is a type of irregular heartbeat, also called an arrhythmia 
It s a very fast or erratic heartbeat that affects the heart s upper chambers 
The typical heart beats about to times a minute 
During SVT, the heart beats about to times a minute 
This is the second most common type of supraventricular tachycardia 
This type of SVT is more commonly seen in people who have heart disease 
Usually during SVT, the heart beats to times a minute 
In infants and very young children, symptoms of SVT may be vague 
Symptoms of SVT may be related to a serious health condition 
Causes Supraventricular tachycardia SVT is caused by faulty signaling in the heart 
In a healthy heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly 
The heart usually beats about to times a minute at rest 
But in SVT, the heart beats faster than beats a minute 
The heart may beat to times a minute 
It also tends to occur more often in women, particularly during pregnancy 
Health conditions or treatments that may increase the risk of supraventricular tachycardia include 
Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and other heart diseases 
A heart problem present at birth, also called a congenital heart defect 
Some medicines, including those used to treat asthma, allergies and colds 
Other things that may increase the risk of SVT include 
This is especially true in people who also have other medical conditions 
PreventionThe same lifestyle changes used to manage supraventricular tachycardia SVT also may help prevent it 
Eat a nutritious diet, don t smoke, get regular exercise and manage stress 
This information can help you learn the things that trigger the very fast heartbeat 
Some medicines, including those bought without a prescription, may contain stimulants that can trigger SVT 
Overview A breast lump is a growth of tissue that forms in the breast 
But it s key to have your healthcare professional check them promptly 
You also may have breast tenderness that comes and goes with your menstrual period 
A lump that feels firm and moves easily under the skin 
When to see a doctorMake an appointment to have a breast lump checked, especially if 
The lump doesn t go away after to weeks 
Or it has changed in size or in how it feels 
Fluid comes out of the nipple suddenly on more than one occasion 
These fluid filled sacs inside the breast are round, smooth and firm 
Breast cysts tend to come on quickly around the time of the menstrual cycle 
With these changes, you may feel general fullness in your breasts 
It s common to have fibrocystic breast changes related to the menstrual cycle 
The symptoms tend to get better after you have your period 
They re smooth, and they move easily under the skin when touched 
A fibroadenoma may get smaller over time or it may grow larger 
This is a skin tag like growth in a milk duct 
It can cause the nipple to leak clear or bloody fluid 
This growth can be seen on a breast ultrasound of the area under the nipple 
The skin covering the lump may thicken, change color or look red 
You may notice fluid leaking from the nipple, or the nipple may turn inward 
The lymph nodes under the arm or near the collarbone might be swollen 
Some conditions that cause breast lumps are more common in the s and s 
That s because the glands that make milk grow in number and get larger 
Some risk factors for breast cancer are within your control to change 
The more alcohol you drink, the higher the risk of breast cancer 
The risk of breast cancer rises if you re overweight or obese after menopause 
Birth control methods that use hormones to prevent pregnancy may slightly raise breast cancer risk 
Long term use of estrogen combined with progesterone can raise the risk of breast cancer 
Other risk factors for cancerous breast lumps can t be controlled 
Women are much more likely than men to get breast cancer 
Most often, tests find breast cancer in people and older 
This means your breasts have more glandular and fibrous tissue, and less fatty tissue 
Some benign breast conditions that cause lumps can make breast cancer more likely later on 
The complications depend on the type of breast lump that you have 
For example, small cysts and simple fibroadenomas sometimes go away on their own over time 
But some risk factors for cancerous breast lumps are within your power to change 
Take the following steps to lower your chances of breast cancer 
Fill your plate with lean proteins, whole grains, and fruits and vegetables 
Or you can try to do to minutes of vigorous activity a week 
If you re not active now, ask your healthcare professional to help you get started 
This can be a sign of infection within the joint 
InjuriesDamage to any part of your knee can cause excess joint fluid to accumulate 
Injuries that can cause fluid buildup in and around the knee joint include 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of a swollen knee include 
Your likelihood of developing a swollen knee related to arthritis increases as you age 
Complications Complications of a swollen knee can include 
A swollen Baker cyst can be painful, but usually improves with icing and compression 
If the swelling is severe, you might need to have fluid removed with a needle 
PreventionA swollen knee is typically the result of an injury or chronic health condition 
Strong muscles around a joint can help ease pressure on the joint itself 
Excess weight contributes to the wear and tear damage that can lead to a swollen knee 
The first symptom is usually swelling or a lump under the skin 
The most common places are in the legs and arms 
Synovial sarcoma is a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma 
Tests for synovial sarcoma might include MRI scan, X ray and CT scan 
The goal is to remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it 
This can sometimes mean the removal of an entire muscle or muscle group 
In the past, surgery might have included removing an arm or leg, known as amputation 
The machine directs radiation to precise points on the body 
Radiation before surgery can shrink the cancer and make surgery success more likely 
Radiation therapy after surgery can kill cancer cells that are still there 
For synovial sarcoma, chemotherapy might be used before or after surgery 
It also may be used when cancer has spread to other parts of the body 
By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die or stop growing 
Syphilis spreads from person to person through direct contact with these sores 
Without treatment, syphilis can damage the heart, brain or other organs 
Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single shot of medicine called penicillin 
All pregnant people should get tested for syphilis at their first prenatal checkup too 
And the symptoms don t always happen in the same order 
You may be infected with syphilis bacteria without noticing any symptoms for years 
Primary syphilisThe first symptom of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre SHANG kur 
It appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body 
The chancre often forms about three weeks after you come in contact with syphilis bacteria 
It also may be hidden within the vagina or rectum 
The chancre heals on its own within to weeks 
The rash often starts on the trunk of the body 
Along with the rash, you may have symptoms such as 
Symptoms of secondary syphilis may go away on their own 
But without treatment, they could come and go for months or years 
This also is called the hidden stage because you have no symptoms 
But without treatment, the disease might lead to major health problems, also called complications 
These problems may happen many years after the original, untreated infection 
Congenital syphilisPregnant people who have syphilis can pass the disease to their babies 
Have had sexual contact with someone who might have the disease 
Causes The cause of syphilis is a bacterium called Treponema pallidum 
It also can be passed to babies during pregnancy and childbirth and sometimes through breastfeeding 
Syphilis can t be spread through casual contact with objects that an infected person has touched 
But you can become infected again if you have contact with someone s syphilis sore 
Risk factors The risk of catching syphilis is higher if you 
Live with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS if untreated 
The chances of getting syphilis also are higher for men who have sex with men 
Complications Without treatment, syphilis can lead to damage throughout the body 
Syphilis also raises the risk of HIV infection and can cause problems during pregnancy 
But it can t repair or reverse damage that s already happened 
Most often, gummas go away after treatment with medicine called antibiotics 
Neurological problemsSyphilis can cause many problems with the brain, its covering or the spinal cord 
Symptoms that mimic dementia, such as loss of memory, judgment and decision making skills 
Not being able to move certain body parts, called paralysis 
Eye problemsDisease that spreads to the eye is called ocular syphilis 
Ear problemsDisease that spreads to the ear is called otosyphilis 
Feeling like you or the world around you is spinning, called vertigo 
This provides an easy way for HIV to enter the bloodstream during sex 
Pregnancy and childbirth complicationsIf you re pregnant, you could pass syphilis to your unborn baby 
To help prevent the spread of syphilis, follow these tips 
The only certain way to avoid contact with syphilis bacteria is not to have sex 
Condoms can lower your risk of getting or spreading syphilis 
But condoms work only if they cover an infected person s syphilis sores 
Other types of birth control do not lower your risk of syphilis 
Be careful with alcohol and stay away from street drugs 
Drinking too much alcohol or taking drugs can get in the way of your judgment 
It can remove some of the healthy bacteria that s usually in the vagina 
This can happen when the baby or pumping equipment touches a sore 
To keep that from happening, pump or hand express breastmilk from the breast with sores 
If your pump touches a sore, get rid of the milk you just pumped 
After you learn you have syphilis, your local health department may contact you 
The practice also steers those at risk toward counseling and the right treatment 
Screening tests for pregnant peopleYou can be infected with syphilis and not know it 
And the disease can have deadly effects on unborn babies 
For this reason, health officials recommend that all pregnant people be tested for the disease 
Overview Syringomyelia sih ring go my E lee uh is the development of a fluid filled cyst within the spinal cord 
The cyst, which is sometimes called a syrinx, can grow larger over time 
When it does, it can damage the spinal cord and cause pain, weakness and stiffness 
This is a condition in which brain tissue pushes into the spinal canal 
If syringomyelia doesn t cause problems, monitoring the condition might be all that s necessary 
But if the symptoms are bothersome, surgery might be needed 
In some cases, coughing or straining can trigger symptoms of syringomyelia, although neither causes syringomyelia 
If you ve had a spinal cord injury, watch for symptoms of syringomyelia 
It may take months to years after an injury before syringomyelia develops 
Make sure your healthcare professional knows you had a spinal cord injury 
If it collects and forms a fluid filled cyst, it is called a syrinx 
Meningitis, which is swelling of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord 
Spinal cord tumor, which can interfere with the regular flow of cerebrospinal fluid 
Conditions present at birth, such as a tethered spinal cord 
Spinal cord injury, which can cause symptoms months or years later 
Complications In some people, syringomyelia can progress and lead to serious complications 
A syrinx can cause complications if it grows or damages nerves within the spinal cord 
A mast cell is a type of white blood cell 
Mast cells are found in connective tissues throughout your body 
Mast cells help your immune system function properly and normally help protect you from disease 
Common triggers include alcohol, spicy foods, insect stings and certain medications 
Less commonly, other organs such as the brain, heart or lungs also may be affected 
The mast cells are triggered to produce substances that cause inflammation and symptoms 
People have different triggers, but the most common ones include 
Typically this flaw in the KIT gene is not inherited 
If you have a severe allergic reaction, you may need an injection of epinephrine 
Chronic stomach irritation can lead to ulcers and bleeding in your digestive tract 
Overview A tapeworm is a parasite that can live and feed in human intestines 
A young and inactive form of the tapeworm is called a larval cyst 
It can stay alive in other parts of the body 
Moderate to severe symptoms may include stomach pain and diarrhea 
Treatments for larval cyst infections may include anti parasitic drugs and surgery to remove the cyst 
SymptomsSymptoms depend mostly on where the infection happens in the body 
Tapeworm infection in the intestinesA tapeworm in the intestines may cause no symptoms 
The severity of symptoms depends in part on the number of tapeworms 
And some symptoms are more likely with some species of tapeworm 
For example, larval cysts can cause severe disease in the liver, lungs or heart 
There also may be pain and swelling at the site of the larval cyst infection 
Causes Most tapeworms need two different hosts to complete a life cycle 
The other host is where the larva become adults, called the definitive host 
For example, beef tapeworms need cattle and humans to go through a complete life cycle 
The beef tapeworm eggs can survive in the environment for months or years 
The young parasite, called a larva, passes into the bloodstream and moves to muscles 
The tapeworm attaches to the wall of the intestine where it feeds 
Tapeworm infectionsHumans are the definitive hosts for some species of tapeworms 
They may get a tapeworm infection after eating raw or undercooked 
Larval cyst infectionsHumans may be the intermediate hosts for other tapeworm species 
This usually happens when they drink water or eat food with tapeworm eggs 
Humans also can be exposed to eggs in dog feces 
The larva travels through the bloodstream and forms a cyst somewhere in the body 
Symptoms also appear when one or more cysts keep an organ from working correctly 
ExceptionsThere are two exceptions to the typical life cycle of tapeworms that can infect humans 
Humans can be a definitive host or an intermediate host for pork tapeworms 
For example, a person can have adult pork tapeworms from eating undercooked pork 
If this happens, a person can get a larval cyst infection 
The dwarf tapeworm enters humans as eggs from food or water 
The larva burrows into the wall of the intestines and forms a larval cyst 
Other eggs hatch in the intestine to make a repeating cycle 
The main risk factor for tapeworm infection is eating raw or undercooked meat and fish 
Dried and smoked fish also may have larval cysts in them 
Poor handwashing increases the risk of getting and spreading infections 
Living in or traveling to regions with high rates of infection is a risk factor 
This can happen because the tapeworm keeps the body from getting enough vitamin B 
When the immune system reacts, it may cause symptoms of severe allergy 
Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, fainting, fever and a drop in blood pressure 
PreventionThese steps can help prevent infections with tapeworms or tapeworm larval cysts 
Rinse fruits and vegetables under running water before eating, peeling or preparing them 
Use a meat thermometer to make sure meat is cooked enough to kill larval cysts 
Cook ground meat to at least degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius 
Freeze at minus degrees Fahrenheit minus degrees Celsius or below for days 
Blood flows through the upper right heart chamber, called the right atrium 
This change in blood flow causes oxygen poor blood to mix with oxygen rich blood 
As a result, blood flowing to the body doesn t have enough oxygen 
The specific type of TAPVR depends on where the veins connect 
Most children born with TAPVR have no family history of congenital heart disease 
The baby s skin may look gray or blue due to low oxygen levels 
A health care provider may notice symptoms of TAPVR soon after birth 
An echocardiogram is the test used to diagnose total anomalous pulmonary venous return 
It also shows blood flow through the heart and heart valves 
TreatmentSurgery for TAPVR is generally needed when a child is a baby 
The timing of surgery depends on whether there s a blockage 
To repair the heart, surgeons connect the pulmonary veins to the left upper heart chamber 
They also close the hole between the upper heart chambers 
A doctor trained in congenital heart diseases should provide care 
Overview Tay Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to child 
It s caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances 
As the disease progresses, development slows and muscles begin to weaken 
Over time, this leads to seizures, vision and hearing loss, paralysis, and other major issues 
Children with this form of Tay Sachs disease typically live only a few years 
SymptomsThere are three forms of Tay Sachs disease infantile, juvenile and late onset adult 
Loss of motor skills, including turning over, crawling and sitting up 
Loss of mental functions and a lack of response to surroundings 
Juvenile formThe juvenile form of Tay Sachs disease is less common 
Signs and symptoms vary in severity and begin in childhood 
Severity of symptoms varies greatly, and this form does not always impact life expectancy 
Causes Tay Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that is passed from parents to their children 
The buildup of fatty substances damages nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord 
Tuberculosis Overview Tuberculosis TB is a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs 
The germs that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria 
Tuberculosis can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or sings 
This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air 
Another person can then breathe in the droplets, and the germs enter the lungs 
Tuberculosis spreads easily where people gather in crowds or where people live in crowded conditions 
But some forms of the bacteria no longer respond well to treatments 
A TB infection may be in one of three stages 
Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection 
Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs 
The germs can t do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control 
Active TB disease happens when the immune system can t control an infection 
Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body 
But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection 
TB infection can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body 
Symptoms vary depending on what part of the body is infected 
Common sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include 
Younger children may have a fever that won t go away and weight loss 
Causes Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease 
They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air 
This can happen when they re speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing 
A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets 
A person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people 
Drug resistant TBSome forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant 
This means that drugs that once cured the disease no longer work 
This happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in bacteria 
Problems that can lead to such drug resistant strains of bacteria include the following 
People didn t follow directions for taking the drugs or stopped taking the drugs 
Other factors increase the risk of an infection becoming active TB disease 
These conditions increase the risk of getting a TB infection 
Living in a community identified as being at high risk of tuberculosis 
Working in health care and treating people with a high risk of TB 
Older adults have a greater risk of active TB disease 
You will take drugs for four, six or nine months 
Take all of the drugs as directed during the entire time 
Spend as little time as possible among members of your household 
Wear a mask when you have to be around other people 
Ask other members of the household to wear masks to protect themselves 
Use a tissue to cover your mouth anytime you sneeze or cough 
Put the dirty tissue in a bag, seal it and throw it away 
Dozens of new TB vaccines are in various stages of development and testing 
Traumatic brain injury Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Mild traumatic brain injury may affect your brain cells temporarily 
SymptomsTraumatic brain injury can have wide ranging physical and psychological effects 
Mild traumatic brain injuryThe signs and symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury may include 
Loss of consciousness for a few seconds to a few minutes 
No loss of consciousness, but a state of being dazed, confused or disoriented 
In a child with traumatic brain injury, you may observe 
Gunshot wounds, domestic violence, child abuse and other assaults are common causes 
Shaken baby syndrome is a traumatic brain injury in infants caused by violent shaking 
Explosive blasts are a common cause of traumatic brain injury in active duty military personnel 
Risk factors The people most at risk of traumatic brain injury include 
Complications Several complications can occur immediately or soon after a traumatic brain injury 
Severe injuries increase the risk of a greater number of and more severe complications 
This results from widespread damage to all parts of the brain 
Widespread damage to the brain can result in a vegetative state 
It is sometimes a transitional state from a coma or vegetative condition to greater recovery 
The seizures may occur only in the early stages, or years after the injury 
This can enable bacteria to enter the brain and cause infections 
This damage could lead to a stroke, blood clots or other problems 
Frequent headaches are very common after a traumatic brain injury 
Many people experience vertigo, a condition characterized by dizziness, after a traumatic brain injury 
Paralysis of facial muscles or losing sensation in the face 
It may be more difficult to focus and take longer to process your thoughts 
Traumatic brain injury can result in problems with many skills, including 
Communication problemsLanguage and communications problems are common following traumatic brain injuries 
Inability to use the muscles needed to form words dysarthria 
Behavioral changesPeople who ve experienced brain injury may experience changes in behaviors 
diseasesThe relationship between degenerative brain diseases and brain injuries is still unclear 
A degenerative brain disorder can cause gradual loss of brain functions, including 
Alzheimer s disease, which primarily causes the progressive loss of memory and other thinking skills 
PreventionFollow these tips to reduce the risk of brain injury 
Wear a helmet while riding a bicycle, skateboard, motorcycle, snowmobile or all terrain vehicle 
Preventing fallsThe following tips can help older adults avoid falls around the house 
Preventing head injuries in childrenThe following tips can help children avoid head injuries 
You have one joint on each side of your jaw 
The exact cause of a person s TMJ disorder is often difficult to determine 
Locking of the joint, making it difficult to open or close your mouth 
Causes The temporomandibular joint combines a hinge action with sliding motions 
The disk erodes or moves out of its proper alignment 
The joint is damaged by a blow or other impact 
In many cases, however, the cause of TMJ disorders isn t clear 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of developing TMJ disorders include 
Various types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis 
Certain connective tissue diseases that cause problems that may affect the temporomandibular joint 
TEN is a life threatening condition that affects people of all ages 
A spreading rash covering more than of the body 
Sores, swelling and crusting on the mucous membranes, including the mouth, eyes and vagina 
You ll likely need care from a skin specialist dermatologist and other experts in a hospital 
Causes SJS TEN is usually caused by a skin reaction to medicine 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of SJS TEN include 
People with cancer, especially blood cancers hematologic malignancies , are at increased risk of SJS TEN 
Sepsis occurs when bacteria from an infection enter your bloodstream and spread throughout your body 
This can cause coughing, difficulty breathing and, with severe disease, acute respiratory failure 
After recovering from TEN, your skin may have bumps, scars and discoloration 
This condition causes distress and can have long term psychological impact 
PreventionTo prevent another episode of TEN, learn whether it was caused by a medicine 
If so, never take that medicine or anything similar again 
Overview Tendinitis is inflammation of the thick fibrous cords that attach muscle to bone 
The condition causes pain and tenderness just outside a joint 
But it s most common around shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees and heels 
Most tendinitis can be treated with rest, physical therapy and medicine to reduce pain 
SymptomsSymptoms of tendinitis tend to occur where a tendon attaches to a bone 
Pain, often described as a dull ache, especially when moving the hurt limb or joint 
When to see a doctorMost cases of tendinitis respond to self care 
But repeating the same movement over time is a much more likely cause 
Moving correctly is especially important when having to repeat movements for sports or a job 
Moving incorrectly can overload the tendon and lead to tendinitis 
WorkTendinitis is more common in people, such as gardeners and manual laborers, whose jobs involve 
ActivitiesWhen doing physical activities, the following can increase the risk of tendinitis 
Medical condition and medicationsCertain medical conditions, such as diabetes, can increase the risk of tendinitis 
Complications Without treatment, tendinitis can increase the risk of a tendon breaking down or tearing 
PreventionTo reduce the chance of developing tendinitis, follow these suggestions 
Avoid activities that place too much stress on your tendons, especially for long periods 
If you have pain during an exercise, stop and rest 
If one exercise or activity causes you pain, try something else 
After exercise, move your joints through full range of motion 
The best time to stretch is after exercise, when your muscles are warmed up 
This will help protect your joints and tendons from stress 
Strengthening muscles used in your activity or sport can help them bear the load better 
The reduced blood flow causes sudden and often severe pain and swelling 
A testicle that s positioned higher than normal or at an unusual angle 
When to see a doctorSeek emergency care for sudden or severe testicle pain 
Surgery is frequently needed to prevent the problem from happening again 
But not every male with the trait will have testicular torsion 
Cold temperature or rapid growth of the testicle during puberty also might play a role 
Testicular torsion is most common between ages and 
The more frequent the bouts of pain, the higher the risk of testicular damage 
If the testicle is badly damaged, it has to be surgically removed 
PreventionHaving testicles that can rotate in the scrotum is a trait inherited by some males 
Compression of the blood vessels and nerves can cause shoulder and neck pain 
Differences in anatomy, such as having an extra or irregular rib, also can cause TOS 
Sometimes the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome is not known 
This is the most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome 
In this type, a group of nerves called the brachial plexus is compressed 
The nerves of the brachial plexus come from the spinal cord 
The nerves control muscle movements and feeling in the shoulder, arm and hand 
It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed 
Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type 
When nerves are compressed, symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include 
Pain or aches in the neck, shoulder, arm or hand 
A change in the color of the hand or one or more fingers 
A change in color in one or more of the fingers or the entire hand 
The extra rib, known as a cervical rib, can compress nerves or blood vessels 
The onset of symptoms related to a traumatic accident often is delayed 
Complications Complications from this condition stem from the type of thoracic outlet syndrome 
You may need treatment for blood clots or an aneurysm 
Neurogenic TOS can be confused for other joint or muscle injuries 
PreventionIf you re at risk of thoracic outlet compression, avoid repetitive movements and lifting heavy objects 
Stretch daily, and do exercises that keep your shoulder muscles strong and flexible 
Overview Platelets are parts of the blood that help form blood clots 
Thrombocytosis throm boe sie TOE sis is a disorder in which your body produces too many platelets 
SymptomsPeople with high platelet levels often don t have signs or symptoms 
Causes Bone marrow is a spongy tissue inside your bones 
It contains stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets 
Inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis or inflammatory bowel disease 
It often appears to be connected to changes in certain genes 
This poses a much higher risk of clotting or bleeding complications than does reactive thrombocytosis 
Complications Essential thrombocythemia can lead to a variety of potentially life threatening complications, such as 
Rarely, essential thrombocythemia may lead to a type of leukemia that progresses quickly 
Pregnancy complicationsMost women who have essential thrombocythemia have normal, healthy pregnancies 
But uncontrolled thrombocythemia can lead to miscarriage and other complications 
Treatment options depend on the type of thyroid nodule you have 
But occasionally some nodules become so large that they can 
Be seen, often as a swelling at the base of your neck 
Press on your windpipe or esophagus, causing shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing 
In some cases, thyroid nodules produce additional thyroxine, a hormone secreted by your thyroid gland 
The extra thyroxine can cause symptoms of an overproduction of thyroid hormones hyperthyroidism , such as 
But determining which nodules are cancerous can t be done by evaluating your symptoms alone 
Seek medical care if you develop signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as 
Sudden weight loss even though your appetite is normal or has increased 
Causes Several conditions can cause nodules to develop in your thyroid gland, including 
An overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue is sometimes referred to as a thyroid adenoma 
Fluid filled cavities cysts in the thyroid most commonly result from degenerating thyroid adenomas 
Often, solid components are mixed with fluid in thyroid cysts 
Cysts are usually noncancerous, but they occasionally contain cancerous solid components 
Hashimoto s disease, a thyroid disorder, can cause thyroid inflammation and result in enlarged nodules 
You will likely want to have it checked by your doctor 
Complications Complications associated with some thyroid nodules include 
Large nodules or a multinodular goiter can interfere with swallowing or breathing 
Hyperthyroidism can result in weight loss, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, and anxiousness or irritability 
It s caused by a brief blockage of blood flow to the brain 
A TIA usually lasts only a few minutes and doesn t cause long term damage 
The symptoms of a TIA are similar to those found early in a stroke 
TIAs most often occur hours or days before a stroke 
Being evaluated quickly means healthcare professionals can pinpoint potential treatable conditions 
Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 
Men have a slightly higher risk of a TIA and a stroke 
But as women age, their risk of a stroke goes up 
If you ve had one or more TIAs, you re much more likely to have a stroke 
Stroke is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, also known as sickle cell anemia 
This includes heart failure, a heart defect, a heart infection or a heart rhythm condition 
Obesity, especially carrying extra weight in the stomach, increases stroke risk 
There is evidence that the virus that causes COVID may raise the risk of stroke 
But quitting smoking lowers the risk of having a TIA or a stroke 
Engaging in minutes of moderate intensity exercise most days helps lower risk 
Eating less fat and salt decreases the risk of a TIA and a stroke 
Stopping smoking reduces your risk of a TIA or a stroke 
If you have high blood pressure, avoid salty foods and don t add salt to food 
The tongue begins in the throat and extends into the mouth 
In the mouth, tongue cancer is called oral tongue cancer 
Tongue cancer in the mouth can cause symptoms right away 
In the throat, tongue cancer is called oropharyngeal tongue cancer 
It may grow for a while before it causes symptoms 
When symptoms happen, they tend to be symptoms that have many possible causes 
Cancer at the back of the tongue is hard to see and examine 
For these reasons, the cancer often isn t diagnosed right away 
Tongue cancer that starts in these cells is called squamous cell carcinoma 
Your health care team considers the type of cancer cells when making a treatment plan 
The team also considers the location and size of the cancer 
Other symptoms may include coughing up blood, weight loss and ear pain 
There also may be a lump in the back of the mouth, throat or neck 
A red or white patch on the tongue or lining of the mouth 
Difficulty or pain with chewing, swallowing, or moving the jaws or tongue 
Causes Tongue cancer starts when healthy cells in the tongue develop changes in their DNA 
In time, the cells can break away and spread to other areas of the body 
It s not always clear what causes the changes that lead to tongue cancer 
Tobacco is the single largest risk factor for tongue cancer 
All forms of tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff, increase the risk 
Frequent and heavy drinking increases the risk of tongue cancer 
Men are more likely to develop tongue cancer than women 
This may be from higher rates of tobacco and alcohol use in men 
People older than have an increased risk of tongue cancer 
This is typically from years of tobacco and alcohol use 
The risk is even higher in those who use alcohol and tobacco 
It also can be caused by illness, such as infection with HIV 
Ask your health care team whether an HPV vaccine is appropriate for you 
Overview Tonsil cancer is an abnormal growth of cells that forms in a tonsil 
Treatments for tonsil cancer include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy 
A sensation that something is caught in the back of your throat 
Causes Tonsil cancer forms when healthy cells in the tonsils develop changes in their DNA 
This common sexually transmitted infection is detected in most tonsil cancers in the United States 
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of tonsil cancer include 
Ask your doctor whether an HPV vaccine is appropriate for you 
SymptomsTonsillitis most commonly affects children between preschool ages and the midteenage years 
A sore throat that doesn t go away within to hours 
Get immediate care if your child has any of these signs 
Other strains of strep and other bacteria also may cause tonsillitis 
This function may make the tonsils particularly vulnerable to infection and inflammation 
Risk factors Risk factors for tonsillitis include 
Infection that results in a collection of pus behind a tonsil peritonsillar abscess 
Complications of scarlet fever, a streptococcal infection characterized by a prominent rash 
PreventionThe germs that cause viral and bacterial tonsillitis are contagious 
Replace his or her toothbrush after being diagnosed with tonsillitis 
To help your child prevent the spread of a bacterial or viral infection to others 
Keep your child at home when he or she is ill 
Ask your doctor when it s all right for your child to return to school 
Teach your child to wash his or her hands after sneezing or coughing 
The abscess can occur at different areas near the tooth for different reasons 
A periapical per e AP ih kul abscess occurs at the tip of the root 
A periodontal per e o DON tul abscess occurs in the gums at the side of a tooth root 
Dentists will treat a tooth abscess by draining it and getting rid of the infection 
They may be able to save your tooth with a root canal treatment 
But in some cases the tooth may need to be pulled 
Leaving a tooth abscess untreated can lead to serious, even life threatening, complications 
Severe, constant, throbbing toothache that can spread to your jawbone, neck or ear 
Pain or discomfort with the pressure of chewing or biting 
Swelling in your face, cheek or neck that may lead to difficulty breathing or swallowing 
Tender, swollen lymph nodes under your jaw or in your neck 
Also go to the emergency room if you have trouble breathing or swallowing 
Causes A periapical tooth abscess occurs when bacteria invade the dental pulp 
The bacterial infection can cause swelling and inflammation at the tip of the root 
Risk factors These factors may increase your risk of a tooth abscess 
Problems may include tooth decay, gum disease, tooth abscess, and other dental and mouth complications 
Having a dry mouth can increase your risk of tooth decay 
You might even develop sepsis a life threatening infection that spreads throughout your body 
PreventionAvoiding tooth decay is essential to preventing a tooth abscess 
Take good care of your teeth to avoid tooth decay 
Brush your teeth for two minutes at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste 
Replace your toothbrush every to months, or whenever the bristles are frayed 
Males are about three to four times more likely than females to develop Tourette syndrome 
Although there s no cure for Tourette syndrome, treatments are available 
Many people with Tourette syndrome don t need treatment when symptoms aren t troublesome 
Tics often lessen or become controlled after the teen years 
Severe symptoms might significantly interfere with communication, daily functioning and quality of life 
These sudden, brief and repetitive tics involve a limited number of muscle groups 
These distinct, coordinated patterns of movements involve several muscle groups 
Tics can also involve movement motor tics or sounds vocal tics 
But the spectrum of tics that people experience is diverse 
Worsen in the early teenage years and improve during the transition into adulthood 
It s a complex disorder likely caused by a combination of inherited genetic and environmental factors 
Risk factors Risk factors for Tourette syndrome include 
Complications People with Tourette syndrome often lead healthy, active lives 
However, Tourette syndrome frequently involves behavioral and social challenges that can harm your self image 
Toxic shock syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
Toxic shock syndrome can affect anyone, including men, children and postmenopausal women 
A rash resembling a sunburn, particularly on your palms and soles 
Causes Most commonly, Staphylococcus aureus staph bacteria cause toxic shock syndrome 
The syndrome can also be caused by group A streptococcus strep bacteria 
Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome occurs in people of all ages 
Having a viral infection, such as the flu or chickenpox 
If you use tampons, read the labels and use the lowest absorbency tampon you can 
Change tampons frequently, at least every four to eight hours 
Alternate using tampons and sanitary napkins, and use minipads when your flow is light 
Overview Toxoplasmosis tok so plaz MOE sis is an infection with a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii 
You can also get it from contact with cat feces 
Most people infected with the parasite do not have symptoms 
Serious disease most often affects infants and people with weakened immune systems 
Several steps to prevent toxoplasmosis can lower the risk of infection 
SymptomsMost people infected with toxoplasmosis do not have any symptoms 
Symptoms of eye diseaseThe toxoplasma parasites may infect tissues of the inner eye 
But the disease is more serious in people with weakened immunity 
Floaters, which are specks that seem to swim in your vision 
A toxoplasmosis infection from earlier in life may become active again 
Rarely, the infection can show up in other tissues throughout the body 
Toxoplasmosis may cause inflammation of the brain, also called encephalitis 
Too much fluid in or around the brain, also called hydrocephalus 
Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, also called jaundice 
But problems may show up later in childhood or teenage years 
The symptoms of severe toxoplasmosis include blurred vision, confusion and loss of coordination 
These need immediate medical care, particularly if you have a weakened immune system 
Causes Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can infect most animals and birds 
It can only go through the entire cycle of reproduction in domestic and wild cats 
Immature eggs, a middle stage of reproduction, can be in the feces of cats 
This immature egg allows for the parasite to make its way through the food chain 
It can pass from soil and water to plants, animals and humans 
If you re in typical health, your immune system keeps the parasites in check 
If you re exposed to the parasite again, your immune system would clear it out 
If your immune system is weakened later in life, parasite reproduction can start again 
This causes a new active infection that can lead to serious disease and complications 
People often get a toxoplasma infection one of the following ways 
Undercooked beef, lamb, pork, venison, chicken and shellfish are all known carriers of the parasite 
Unpasteurized goat milk and untreated drinking water also may be carriers 
The surface of fruits and vegetables may have the parasite on them 
Rarely, toxoplasma parasites are passed through an organ transplant or blood transfusion 
Risk factors The parasite is found throughout the world 
Do not eat raw clams, mussels or oysters, particularly during pregnancy 
Wash fresh fruits and vegetables before eating, peeling or cooking 
Avoid unpasteurized goat milk or products made from the milk 
Cover sandboxes to prevent outdoor cats from using them as litter boxes 
Feed it dry or canned cat food, not raw or undercooked meat 
Overview Trachoma truh KOH muh is a bacterial infection that affects your eyes 
It can also be passed on by handling infected items, such as handkerchiefs 
At first, trachoma may cause mild itching and irritation of your eyes and eyelids 
Then you may notice swollen eyelids and pus draining from the eyes 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include 
But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood 
The World Health Organization WHO has identified five stages in the development of trachoma 
The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification 
Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in entropion 
Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea 
Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood 
Treating it as soon as possible helps prevent serious infection 
Trachoma spreads through contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person 
Hands, clothing, towels and insects can all be routes for transmission 
In developing countries, eye seeking flies also are a means of transmission 
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of contracting trachoma include 
People living in close contact are at greater risk of spreading infection 
PreventionIf you ve been treated for trachoma with antibiotics or surgery, reinfection is always a concern 
Keeping faces and hands clean may help break the cycle of reinfection 
Reducing fly populations can help eliminate a source of transmission 
Properly disposing of animal and human waste can reduce breeding grounds for flies 
Having a fresh water source nearby can help improve hygienic conditions 
While the goal hasn t been entirely achieved, trachoma cases have declined sharply 
The condition is present at birth, which means it s a congenital heart defect 
TypesThere are two types of transposition of the great arteries 
Complete transposition of the great arteries, also called dextro transposition of the great arteries D TGA 
This type reduces the amount of oxygen rich blood to the body 
Congenitally corrected transposition, also called levo transposition of the great arteries L TGA 
Surgery to correct the positions of the arteries is the usual treatment 
Symptoms of transposition of the great arteries after birth include 
But as the baby becomes more active, less blood flows through the body 
The blue or gray skin color then becomes more noticeable 
Causes Transposition of the great arteries occurs during pregnancy when the baby s heart is developing 
Blood then flows into the lower left chamber, known as the left ventricle 
The body s main artery, called the aorta, typically connects to the left ventricle 
It carries oxygen rich blood out of the heart to the rest of the body 
The pulmonary artery connects to the left lower heart chamber 
Oxygen poor blood now flows through the right side of the heart 
It goes back to the body without passing through the lungs 
Oxygen rich blood now flows through the left side of the heart 
The lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle, is on the heart s right side 
The lower right heart chamber is on the heart s left side 
The blood usually still flows correctly through the heart and body 
People with L TGA may also have problems with the tricuspid heart valve 
A history of German measles rubella or another infection by a virus during pregnancy 
Complications Complications depend on the type of transposition of the great arteries TGA 
Possible complications of complete transposition of the great arteries D TGA may include 
The strain may make the muscle of the right lower chamber stiff or weak 
In L TGA, the right lower heart chamber pumps blood to the body 
This work is different from what that chamber was designed to do 
This can cause changes in how well the heart pumps blood 
A complete heart block occurs if all signals are blocked 
It can eventually reduce the heart s ability to pump blood 
It may be possible to have a healthy pregnancy, but special care may be needed 
It s important to take steps to have a healthy pregnancy 
This can cause pain, muscle weakness, paralysis, sensory problems, or bladder and bowel dysfunction 
It could also be caused by other myelin disorders, such as multiple sclerosis 
Those with severe attacks sometimes are left with major disabilities 
Transverse myelitis pain may begin suddenly in your lower back 
Sharp pain may shoot down your legs or arms or around your chest or abdomen 
Pain symptoms vary based on the part of your spinal cord that s affected 
Some people with transverse myelitis report sensations of numbness, tingling, coldness or burning 
Some people notice heaviness in the legs, or that they re stumbling or dragging one foot 
This may include needing to urinate more frequently, urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating and constipation 
It s important to get a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment 
Causes The exact reason for transverse myelitis is not known 
Viral, bacterial and fungal infections affecting the spinal cord may cause transverse myelitis 
In most cases, the inflammatory disorder appears after recovery from the infection 
Herpes viruses, including the one that causes shingles and chickenpox zoster 
Other viruses may trigger an autoimmune reaction without directly infecting the spinal cord 
Bacterial skin infections, gastroenteritis and certain types of bacterial pneumonia also may cause transverse myelitis 
Rarely, parasites and fungal infections may infect the spinal cord 
There are a number of inflammatory conditions that appear to cause the disorder 
Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of multiple sclerosis or represent a relapse 
Transverse myelitis associated with neuromyelitis optica usually affects both sides of your body 
This can happen with or separately from transverse myelitis symptoms 
Autoimmune disorders probably contribute to transverse myelitis in some people 
Transverse myelitis associated with an autoimmune disorder may be a warning sign of neuromyelitis optica 
Neuromyelitis optica occurs more frequently in people with other autoimmune diseases 
Vaccinations for infectious diseases have occasionally been associated as a possible trigger 
However, at this time the association is not strong enough to warrant limiting any vaccine 
It may mimic neuromyelitis optica, but typically sarcoidosis symptoms develop more slowly 
Complications People with transverse myelitis usually experience only one episode 
Pain, one of the most common debilitating long term complications of the disorder 
Stiffness, tightness or painful spasms in your muscles muscle spasticity 
Partial or total paralysis of your arms, legs or both 
Men may experience difficulty achieving an erection or reaching orgasm 
Trichinosis Overview Trichinosis trik ih NO sis , sometimes called trichinellosis trik ih nuh LOW sis , is a type of roundworm infection 
These roundworm parasites trichinella use a host body to live and reproduce 
These parasites infect animals such as bears, cougars, walruses, foxes, wild boars and domestic pigs 
Trichinosis is most widespread in rural areas throughout the world 
Trichinosis can be treated with medication, though it s not always needed 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of trichinosis infection and how severe the infection is can vary 
This depends on the number of larvae eaten in the infected meat 
These symptoms sometimes get worse as the roundworm trichinella larvae travel through your body 
Initial signs and symptomsYou swallow roundworm trichinella larvae in tiny sacks cysts containing the parasite 
Your digestive juices dissolve the cysts, releasing the larvae into your body 
Digestive symptoms can begin to days after infection 
Later signs and symptomsAbout a week after infection, the adult female worms produce larvae 
Here, each larva coils up and forms a cyst around itself 
The larvae can live for months to years inside the muscle tissue 
With a large number of parasites, muscle pain and weakness can be severe 
Animals are infected when they feed on other infected animals 
Risk factors Risk factors for trichinosis include 
It can also include other meat contaminated by grinders or other equipment 
Trichinosis is more common in rural areas around the world 
Public health measures have greatly lowered the number of trichinosis infections from commercial meats 
Complications Except in severe cases, complications related to trichinosis are rare 
Protective tissue layer surrounding the brain and spinal cord meningitis 
Be sure to thoroughly cook cuts of meat until brown 
Use a meat thermometer to make sure the meat is thoroughly cooked 
But roundworm parasites in wild animal meat won t die by freezing, even over a long period 
Also, microwave cooking isn t recommended as a way to kill roundworm parasites 
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for seconds after handling raw meat 
Trichomoniasis Overview Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by a parasite 
In women, trichomoniasis can cause a foul smelling vaginal discharge, genital itching and painful urination 
Pregnant women who have trichomoniasis might be at higher risk of delivering their babies prematurely 
To prevent being infected again, all sexual partners should be treated at the same time 
When signs and symptoms develop, they are different for men and women 
When men do have signs and symptoms, however, they might include 
The parasite passes between people during genital contact, including vaginal, oral or anal sex 
The infection can be passed between men and women, women, and sometimes men 
But it s thought to range from four to days 
Even without symptoms, you or your partner can still spread the infection 
Risk factors Risk factors for getting trichomoniasis include having 
Give the infection to the baby as the baby passes through the birth canal 
To lower your risk, use internal or external condoms correctly every time you have sex 
The valve isn t formed between the two right heart chambers 
Instead, a solid sheet of tissue blocks the blood flow between the right heart chambers 
Tricuspid atresia causes the right lower heart to be underdeveloped 
People with tricuspid atresia can t get enough oxygen through the body 
So they tire easily and they are often short of breath 
Blue or gray skin and lips due to low blood oxygen levels 
Some people with tricuspid atresia also develop symptoms of heart failure 
The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through the lung arteries 
The blood then flows out to the rest of the body 
Valves control the flow of blood into and out of the heart 
The heart valves close to keep blood from flowing backward 
What happens in tricuspid atresiaIn tricuspid atresia, the tricuspid valve is missing 
A sheet of tissue blocks the flow of blood between the right heart chambers 
When the foramen ovale doesn t close after birth, it s called a patent foramen ovale 
How blood flows after that depends on whether there are other heart structure problems 
Then it goes to the lungs through a temporary connection called the ductus arteriosus 
Many babies born with tricuspid atresia also have a hole between the lower heart chambers 
This hole is called a ventricular septal defect or ventricular septal defect VSD 
If the VSD is large, too much blood can move to the lungs 
Many babies born with a genetic disorder called Down syndrome have tricuspid atresia 
Other things that might increase your baby s risk of tricuspid atresia include 
Having German measles rubella or another viral illness during early pregnancy 
Complications Tricuspid atresia restricts blood flow from the heart to the lungs 
A life threatening complication of tricuspid atresia is a lack of oxygen to the body s tissues 
Prompt treatment greatly improves the outcome for babies with tricuspid atresia 
Consider talking with a genetic counselor and a pediatric heart doctor about your specific risks 
It may help reduce the risk of congenital heart defects as well 
Some medications taken during pregnancy can cause health problems in the baby 
Overview Tricuspid valve disease is a type of heart valve disease valvular heart disease 
Tricuspid valve disease often occurs with other heart valve problems 
Symptoms and treatments of tricuspid valve disease vary, depending on the specific valve condition 
Treatment may include monitoring, medication, or valve repair or valve replacement 
As a result, blood leaks backward into the upper right chamber right atrium 
In this condition present at birth congenital heart defect , the tricuspid valve isn t formed 
A solid sheet of tissue blocks the blood flow between the right heart chambers 
This is a rare heart problem that s present at birth congenital heart defect 
The tricuspid valve is in the wrong position and the valve s flaps are malformed 
Blood might leak backward through the valve tricuspid valve regurgitation 
Overview Tricuspid valve regurgitation is a type of heart valve disease 
The valve between the two right heart chambers doesn t close as it should 
Blood flows backward through the valve into the upper right chamber 
If you have tricuspid valve regurgitation, less blood flows to the lungs 
Some people are born with heart valve disease that leads to tricuspid regurgitation 
Mild tricuspid valve regurgitation may not cause symptoms or require treatment 
If the condition is severe and causing symptoms, medicine or surgery may be needed 
SymptomsTricuspid valve regurgitation often doesn t cause symptoms until the condition is severe 
It may be found when medical tests are done for another reason 
You may need to see a doctor trained in heart conditions, called a cardiologist 
Four valves open and close to keep blood flowing in the correct direction 
The tricuspid valve is between the heart s two right chambers 
It has three thin flaps of tissue, called cusps or leaflets 
The valve flaps then close tightly so blood doesn t flow backward 
In tricuspid valve regurgitation, the tricuspid valve doesn t close tightly 
So, blood leaks backward into the upper right heart chamber 
A heart problem you re born with, also called a congenital heart defect 
Some congenital heart defects affect the shape of the tricuspid valve and how it works 
In this condition, the tricuspid valve does not form correctly 
It also is lower than usual in the lower right heart chamber 
Infection of the lining of the heart and heart valves, also called infective endocarditis 
Things that can increase the risk of tricuspid valve regurgitation are 
Being born with a heart problem, called a congenital heart defect 
Use of some weight loss drugs and medicines to treat migraines and mental health disorders 
Complications Tricuspid valve regurgitation complications may depend on how severe the condition is 
An irregular and often rapid heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation AFib 
Some people with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation also have this common heart rhythm disorder 
AFib has been linked to an increased risk of blood clots and stroke 
The extra effort causes the lower right heart chamber to get bigger 
Triple X syndrome Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
In triple X syndrome, a female has three X chromosomes 
In others, symptoms may be more apparent possibly including developmental delays and learning disabilities 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms can vary greatly among girls and women with triple X syndrome 
Many experience no noticeable effects or have only mild symptoms 
Being taller than average height is the most typical physical feature 
Others may have intellectual disabilities and sometimes may have behavioral problems 
Learning disabilities, such as difficulty with reading, understanding or math 
Behavioral problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD or symptoms of autism spectrum disorder 
Problems with fine and gross motor skills, memory, judgment and information processing 
Sometimes females with triple X syndrome have these signs and symptoms 
Vertical folds of skin that cover the inner corners of the eyes epicanthal folds 
Ovaries that don t work properly at a young age premature ovarian failure 
These chromosomes contain genes, which carry instructions that determine everything from height to eye color 
The pair of sex chromosomes either XX or XY determines a child s sex 
Females with the mosaic form may have less obvious symptoms 
Need for additional support or assistance with learning, activities of daily living, school or work 
Overview Truncus arteriosus TRUNG kus ahr teer e O sus is a rare heart problem present at birth 
In this condition, one large blood vessel leads out of the heart, instead of two 
Having only one large blood vessel means that oxygen poor and oxygen rich blood mix 
This mixing reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the body 
It usually increases the amount of blood flow into the lungs too 
The heart has to work harder to adjust for the changes in blood flow 
Surgery is generally successful, especially if done before the baby is month old 
SymptomsSymptoms of truncus arteriosus usually occur in the first few days of life 
Always seek emergency medical care if a baby has any of the following 
Causes Truncus arteriosus occurs as a baby s heart forms during pregnancy 
This heart chamber receives oxygen rich blood from the lungs through vessels called pulmonary veins 
A baby s heart before birthThe formation of a baby s heart is complex 
It usually splits in two as the baby grows in the womb 
One part becomes the lower end of the body s main artery, called the aorta 
The other part becomes the lower part of the pulmonary artery 
The wall separating the two lower heart chambers isn t closed completely 
This results in a large hole between those chambers, called a ventricular septal defect 
This valve may not close completely when the heart relaxes 
Blood can move the wrong way, back into the heart 
Risk factors The exact cause of truncus arteriosus is unknown 
But some things might increase the risk of a heart problem at birth 
For example, having German measles during pregnancy can cause problems in a baby s heart development 
Some medicines can cause heart problems and other health conditions in a baby 
Tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription 
An extra or irregular chromosome increases the risk of truncus arteriosus 
Examples are DiGeorge syndrome, also called q deletion syndrome, and velocardiofacial syndrome 
Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of heart problems in your baby 
Obesity increases the risk of giving birth to a baby with a heart problem 
Extra fluid and blood into the lungs can make it difficult to breathe 
This condition causes the blood vessels in the lungs to narrow 
It becomes hard for the heart to pump blood into the lungs 
In this condition, the heart cannot supply the body with enough blood 
Too little oxygen and too much strain on the heart can lead to heart failure 
Backward flow of blood through a heart valve, called regurgitation 
It results in a significant lack of blood flow to the lungs 
PreventionBecause the cause is unclear, it may not be possible to prevent truncus arteriosus 
If you decide to get pregnant, taking these steps can help keep your baby healthy 
Many drugs aren t recommended for use during pregnancy because they can harm a developing baby 
It may help reduce the risk of heart problems present at birth too 
Symptoms vary widely, depending on where the growths develop and how big they get 
Tuberous sclerosis is often first found during infancy or childhood 
Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include 
These include patches of lighter skin and small areas of thickened, smooth or bumpy skin 
Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur 
Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common 
A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis 
Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn 
Mental health conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD , also can occur 
Growths on the kidneys are common, and more growths may develop with age 
These lung tumors occur more often in females than in males 
Small growths may appear on the gums, inside of the cheeks and on the tongue 
When to see a doctorSymptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth 
Or the first symptoms may appear during childhood or even years later in adulthood 
Risk factors Tuberous sclerosis can be the result of either 
Most people do not have a family history of tuberous sclerosis 
Growths in the lungs damage the lung tissue and can lead to collapsed lungs 
Turner syndrome may be diagnosed before birth prenatally , during infancy or in early childhood 
Girls and women with Turner syndrome need ongoing medical care from a variety of specialists 
Regular checkups and appropriate care can help most girls and women lead healthy, independent lives 
SymptomsSigns and symptoms of Turner syndrome may vary among girls and women with the disorder 
Prenatal ultrasound of a baby with Turner syndrome may show 
Large fluid collection on the back of the neck or other abnormal fluid collections edema 
At birth or during infancySigns of Turner syndrome at birth or during infancy may include 
Adult height significantly less than might be expected for a female member of the family 
For most females with Turner syndrome, inability to conceive a child without fertility treatment 
See your doctor if there are concerns about the possibility of Turner syndrome 
Males inherit the X chromosome from their mothers and the Y chromosome from their fathers 
The genetic changes of Turner syndrome may be one of the following 
This results in every cell in the body having only one X chromosome 
In some cases, an error occurs in cell division during early stages of fetal development 
Other cells have only one copy of the X chromosome 
Changed or missing parts of one of the X chromosomes can occur 
Physical characteristics and health complications that arise from these chromosomal issues vary greatly 
Risk factors The loss or alteration of the X chromosome occurs randomly 
In some cases, this is due to the gradual loss of nerve function 
An increased risk of frequent middle ear infections can also result in hearing loss 
Turner syndrome may be associated with malformations of the kidneys 
Sometimes Turner syndrome is associated with gluten intolerance celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease 
Turner syndrome can also increase the risk of developing weak, brittle bones osteoporosis 
Girls and women with Turner syndrome usually have normal intelligence 
Typhoid fever Overview Typhoid fever, also called enteric fever, is caused by salmonella bacteria 
Typhoid fever is rare in places where few people carry the bacteria 
One example of where typhoid fever is rare is the United States 
Food and water with the bacteria in it cause typhoid fever 
But without treatment, there is a small chance of death from typhoid fever complications 
But they can t protect against all cases of illness caused by other strains of salmonella 
People also may have a cough, loss of appetite and sweating 
Later illnessA few weeks after symptoms start, the illness can cause problems in the intestines 
An infection caused by gut bacteria spreading throughout the body, called sepsis 
Not be able to pay attention to anything around them 
Not be able to react to the world around them 
For some that might be the closest embassy or consulate 
This might help get typhoid fever diagnosed and treated more quickly 
Causes A bacteria strain called Salmonella enterica serotype typhi causes typhoid fever 
Other strains of salmonella bacteria cause a similar disease called paratyphoid fever 
People pick up the bacteria most often in places where outbreaks are common 
The bacteria also can spread from a person who carries the bacteria 
It can spread on food that isn t cooked, such as raw fruits without a peel 
But they still shed the bacteria in their stools and spread it 
But cases are recorded worldwide, often due to travelers to and from these areas 
Work as a clinical microbiologist handling Salmonella enterica serotype typhi bacteria 
Complications Damage to the intestinesTyphoid fever complications can include damage and bleeding in the intestines 
This allows the contents of the gut to leak into the body 
That can cause severe stomach pain, vomiting and infection throughout the body called sepsis 
Damage to the intestines can develop in the later part of the illness 
Inflammation of the lining of the heart and valves, called endocarditis 
This is an option if you live where typhoid fever is common 
Management of human waste also helps people avoid the bacteria 
And careful hand washing for people who prepare and serve food is also important 
VaccinesTwo vaccines are available in the United States for people age and older 
One is given as a single shot at least one week before travel 
Because the vaccine won t provide complete protection, follow these guidelines when traveling to high risk areas 
Frequent hand washing in hot, soapy water is the best way to control infection 
Wash before eating or preparing food and after using the toilet 
Carry an alcohol based hand sanitizer for times when soap and water aren t available 
Contaminated drinking water is a problem in areas where typhoid fever is common 
To be safe, you may want to avoid raw foods 
Freshly made, steaming hot foods may be less risky than uncooked foods 
Find out about medical care in the areas you ll visit 
Carry a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of health care providers 
Prevent infecting othersIf you re recovering from typhoid fever, these measures can help keep others safe 
Avoid preparing food for others until your health care provider says you re no longer contagious 
Overview Ulnar wrist pain is pain on the side of your wrist opposite the thumb 
Pain that worsens when gripping something or twisting the wrist 
A common cause of wrist injuries is a fall onto an outstretched hand 
People who regularly use a computer mouse or keyboard are at risk 
People with generally loose ligaments, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or gout also are at risk 
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of ureteral cancer include 
Most people diagnosed with this cancer are in their s and s 
If you have a strong family history of cancer, discuss it with your doctor 
As a result of a stricture, less urine comes out of the bladder 
This can cause problems in the urinary tract, such as infection 
Passing urine more often or feeling the need to pass urine more often 
Causes Scar tissue, which can narrow the urethra, can be due to 
A medical procedure that involves putting a tool, such as an endoscope, into the urethra 
A tube that s put into the urethra to drain the bladder, called a catheter 
An enlarged prostate or having had surgery to remove or reduce an enlarged prostate gland 
Urethral stricture is much more common in males than in females 
The urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra 
Most infections involve the lower urinary tract the bladder and the urethra 
Women are at greater risk of developing a UTI than are men 
If an infection is limited to the bladder, it can be painful and annoying 
But serious health problems can result if a UTI spreads to the kidneys 
Health care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics 
Urine that appears red, bright pink or cola colored signs of blood in the urine 
In older adults, UTIs may be overlooked or mistaken for other conditions 
The symptoms depend on which part of the urinary tract is affected 
The most common UTIs occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra 
This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli E coli 
E coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal GI tract 
All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy 
An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections 
This can happen because women s urethras are close to the vagina 
Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes 
Risk factors for UTIs that are specific to women include 
As a result, there s less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder 
Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTIs 
After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract 
Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating 
Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTIs 
Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder 
Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system the body s defense against germs 
Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital 
Complications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications 
Permanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI 
Delivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy 
A narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra 
Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTIs aren t final 
It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra 
Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria 
Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra 
Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth 
Overview Regular urine color ranges from clear to pale yellow 
And some medicines can give urine vivid tones, such as orange or greenish blue 
An unusual urine color also can be a sign of a health problem 
For instance, some urinary tract infections can turn urine milky white 
Kidney stones, some cancers and other diseases sometimes make urine look red due to blood 
So the more you drink, the clearer your urine looks 
But urine can turn colors far beyond what s typical, including 
When to see a doctorSee your health care provider if you have 
This is common in urinary tract infections and kidney stones 
Painless bleeding might be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer 
Here are some unusual urine colors along with things that can cause them 
Keep in mind that colors can look slightly different to different people 
For instance, what looks red to you might look orange to someone else 
urineRed urine isn t always a sign of a serious health problem 
Hard exercise, such as long distance running, also can cause this bleeding 
Beets, blackberries and rhubarb can turn urine red or pink 
A tuberculosis medicine called rifampin Rifadin, Rimactane can turn urine reddish orange 
So can a medicine for urinary tract pain called phenazopyridine Pyridium 
Constipation drugs that contain the medicine senna also can bring on this color change 
So can sulfasalazine Azulfidine , a medicine that lessens swelling and irritation 
Some chemotherapy medicines for cancer also can make urine look orange 
Some vitamins, such as A and B , can turn urine orange or yellow orange 
Blue or green urineBlue or green urine can be caused by 
Dyes used for some kidney and bladder tests can turn urine blue 
A medicine for depression called amitriptyline can make urine look greenish blue 
So can a treatment for ulcers and acid reflux called cimetidine Tagamet HB 
A water pill called triamterene Dyrenium also can turn urine greenish blue 
A rare disease called familial benign hypercalcemia can cause children to have blue urine 
Urinary tract infections caused by a certain type of bacteria can cause green urine 
Dark brown or cola colored urineBrown urine can be caused by 
Eating lots of fava beans, rhubarb or aloe can cause dark brown urine 
The antibiotics metronidazole Flagyl, Metrocream, others and nitrofurantoin Furadantin, Macrobid, others 
Some liver and kidney disorders and some urinary tract infections can turn urine dark brown 
A muscle injury from extreme exercise can cause tea or cola colored urine 
Both kidney disease and kidney stones can cause blood in the urine 
But anyone who exercises hard can have blood in the urine 
Possible causes of uveitis are infection, injury, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disease 
Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications and preserve your vision 
Symptoms may occur suddenly and get worse quickly, though in some cases, they develop gradually 
The uvea is the middle layer of tissue in the wall of the eye 
It consists of the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid 
The choroid is a layer of blood vessels between the retina and the sclera 
The retina lines the inside of the back of the eye, like wallpaper 
It is also called iritis and is the most common type of uveitis 
He or she may refer you to an eye specialist ophthalmologist 
If you re having significant eye pain and unexpected vision problems, seek immediate medical attention 
If a cause can be determined, it may be one of the following 
Uveitis is one of the most common complications of ankylosing spondylitis 
An infection, such as cat scratch disease, herpes zoster, syphilis, toxoplasmosis or tuberculosis 
Very rarely, a cancer that affects the eye, such as lymphoma 
Cigarette smoking has been associated with more difficult to control uveitis 
The condition is also known as mullerian agenesis, mullerian aplasia or Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome 
Vaginal agenesis is often identified at puberty when a female does not begin menstruating 
SymptomsVaginal agenesis often goes unnoticed until females reach their teens, but don t menstruate amenorrhea 
There may be no uterus or one that s only partially developed 
If there s tissue lining the uterus endometrium , monthly cramping or chronic abdominal pain may occur 
Vaginal agenesis may also be associated with other issues, such as 
Developmental changes in the bones of the spine, ribs and wrists 
Other congenital conditions that also involve the heart, gastrointestinal tract and limb growth 
Females with a missing or partially developed uterus can t get pregnant 
They are named based on the location of the fistula and organs they affect 
Also called a bladder fistula, this opening forms between the vagina and urinary bladder 
This type of fistula also is called a urethral fistula 
The opening is between the small intestine and the vagina 
Leaking of urine or stool, or passing of gas, through the vagina 
The exact symptoms a person has depend in part on the location of the fistula 
Surgeries that involve the vaginal wall, anus or rectum can lead to vaginal fistulas 
So can surgery on the area between the vagina and anus, called the perineum 
Fistulas can form for reasons such as injuries during surgery and infections after surgery 
Skilled surgeons can repair injuries while operating, which lowers the risk of fistula 
The risk is higher if the hysterectomy is more complex 
That s partly because access to emergency delivery measures such as C section may be limited 
If you follow your Crohn s treatment plan, you re not likely to get a vaginal fistula 
Cancer of the anus, rectum, vagina or cervix can lead to a vaginal fistula 
So can damage from radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer in the pelvic area 
This condition involves small, bulging pouches in the digestive tract 
Diverticulitis that leads to a vaginal fistula is more common in older people 
It also is more likely to cause a vaginal fistula in an older person 
Risk factors A vaginal fistula has no clear risk factors 
Complications Vaginal fistulas can lead to other health conditions called complications 
Loss of a pregnancy after weeks, also called stillbirth 
PreventionThere are no steps you need to take to prevent a vaginal fistula 
The cause is usually a change in the balance of vaginal bacteria or an infection 
Reduced estrogen levels after menopause and some skin disorders also can cause vaginitis 
These are usually caused by a naturally occurring fungus called Candida albicans 
This is caused by a parasite and is often sexually transmitted 
Change in color, odor or amount of discharge from your vagina 
The odor, often described as a fishy odor, might be more obvious after sex 
An infection called trichomoniasis trik o moe NIE uh sis can cause a greenish yellow, sometimes frothy discharge 
You have a particularly unpleasant vaginal odor, discharge or itching 
You ve had multiple sex partners or a recent new partner 
You ve completed a course of over the counter anti yeast medication and your symptoms persist 
Causes The cause depends on what type of vaginitis you have 
This common sexually transmitted infection is caused by a microscopic, one celled parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis 
This organism spreads during sex with someone who has the infection 
In men, the organism usually infects the urinary tract, but often it causes no symptoms 
In women, trichomoniasis typically infects the vagina, and might cause symptoms 
It also increases women s risk of getting other sexually transmitted infections 
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of developing vaginitis include 
Hormonal changes, such as those associated with pregnancy, birth control pills or menopause 
Use of hygiene products such as bubble bath, vaginal spray or vaginal deodorant 
PreventionGood hygiene might prevent some types of vaginitis from recurring and relieve some symptoms 
Don t use harsh soaps, such as those with deodorant or antibacterial action, or bubble bath 
Using a condom and limiting the number of sex partners can help 
A solid sheet of tissue blocks the blood flow between the heart chambers 
Surgery to treat varicocele may be recommended to address these complications 
A smaller varicocele may be too small to see but noticeable by touch 
The affected testicle may be noticeably smaller than the other testicle 
A varicocele may lead to difficulty fathering a child, but not all varicoceles cause infertility 
A number of conditions could contribute to pain, swelling or a mass in the scrotum 
Similarly, there are also two testicular veins that transport oxygen depleted blood back toward the heart 
For men, a varicocele may result in gradual shrinkage due to tissue loss 
Among men with fertility problems, about have a varicocele 
Any vein that is close to the skin s surface, called superficial, can become varicosed 
Varicose veins most often affect the veins in the legs 
That s because standing and walking increase the pressure in the veins of the lower body 
For many people, varicose veins are simply a cosmetic concern 
So are spider veins, a common, mild form of varicose veins 
Treatment involves exercising, raising legs when sitting or lying down, or wearing compression stockings 
A procedure may be done to close or remove veins 
Veins that are dark purple, blue or the same color as the skin 
Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see 
When there are painful symptoms of varicose veins, they might include 
Burning, throbbing, muscle cramping and swelling in the lower legs 
Worse pain after sitting or standing for a long time 
Spider veins occur on the legs but also can be found on the face 
They vary in size and often look like a spider s web 
Causes Weak or damaged valves can lead to varicose veins 
Arteries carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body 
Veins return blood from the rest of the body to the heart 
To return blood to the heart, the veins in the legs must work against gravity 
Muscles tighten in the lower legs to act as pumps 
Risk factors The two main risk factors for varicose veins are 
If other family members have varicose veins, there s a greater chance you will too 
Other things that might increase the risk of varicose veins include 
Hormone treatments, such as birth control pills, might increase the risk of varicose veins 
Painful ulcers can form on the skin near varicose veins, mostly near the ankles 
A discolored spot on the skin often begins before an ulcer forms 
See your healthcare professional right away if you think you have a leg ulcer 
PreventionGetting better blood flow and muscle tone might lower the risk of having varicose veins 
The same ways you treat the discomfort from varicose veins can help prevent them 
Don t wear high heels or tight stockings, other than compression stockings 
Vascular ringsA vascular ring is a heart problem present at birth 
The condition affects the part of the aorta called the aortic arch 
The food swallowing tube leads from the mouth to the stomach 
A complete vascular ring forms a ring around both the esophagus and trachea 
An incomplete vascular ring doesn t go all the way around the esophagus or trachea 
Some people born with a vascular ring also may have other heart problems at birth 
Specific symptoms depend on the type of heart problems present 
DiagnosisA health care provider does a physical exam and asks questions about the symptoms 
A chest X ray can show changes in the windpipe that might suggest a vascular ring 
The test also can show which side of the body the aortic arch is on 
Other imaging tests may include an echocardiogram, a CT angiogram or an MRI scan 
Health care providers also may use these tests to plan treatment 
X rays are taken to see how the substance moves from the mouth to the stomach 
A long, flexible tube with a camera is used to examine the esophagus 
The health care provider inserts it through the mouth and into the throat 
A tiny camera at the tip sends images to a video monitor 
This test can show if a vascular ring is pushing against the trachea 
The surgery may be done as open heart surgery or as a minimally invasive approach 
The specific type of surgery depends on the type of heart problems present 
People born with a vascular ring need regular health checkups for life to prevent complications 
Ventricular fibrillation Overview Ventricular fibrillation is a type of irregular heart rhythm arrhythmia 
During ventricular fibrillation, the lower heart chambers contract in a very rapid and uncoordinated manner 
As a result, the heart doesn t pump blood to the rest of the body 
Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention 
Medications, implanted devices or surgery may be recommended to prevent episodes of ventricular fibrillation 
If you see someone collapse, seek emergency medical help immediately 
It s not necessary to check the person s airway or deliver rescue breaths 
Use an automated external defibrillator AED as soon as it s available 
A disruption of the blood supply to the heart muscle 
Risk factors Things that may increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation include 
Injuries that cause damage to the heart muscle, such as being struck by lightning 
Complications Without immediate treatment, ventricular fibrillation can cause death within minutes 
Ventricular fibrillation is the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death 
The risk of other long term complications depends on how fast treatment is received 
Overview Ventricular tachycardia is a type of irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia 
It starts in the lower chambers of the heart, called the ventricles 
A healthy heart typically beats about to times a minute at rest 
In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats faster, usually or more beats a minute 
Sometimes the rapid heartbeat stops the heart chambers from properly filling with blood 
The heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body 
If this happens, you may feel short of breath or lightheaded 
Ventricular tachycardia episodes may be brief and last only a few seconds without causing harm 
But episodes lasting more than a few seconds, called sustained V tach, can be life threatening 
Sometimes ventricular tachycardia can cause all heart activity to stop 
So the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen 
Symptoms of ventricular tachycardia are due to a lack of oxygen 
Ventricular tachycardia can be a medical emergency even if your symptoms are minor 
This type of ventricular tachycardia can cause serious health problems 
It s important to get a fast, accurate diagnosis and appropriate care 
Make an appointment for a health checkup if you think you have an irregular heartbeat 
Call or your local emergency number for these symptoms 
Many things can cause or lead to problems with heart signaling and trigger ventricular tachycardia 
Any heart condition that caused scarring of heart tissue, called structural heart disease 
Poor blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease 
Sometimes, the exact cause of ventricular tachycardia can t be determined 
But some things can change how electrical signals travel through the heart 
Lifestyle changes such as eating healthy and not smoking may lower the risk 
Severe changes in the level of body minerals, called electrolyte imbalances 
A history of using stimulant drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine 
A life threatening complication of V tach is ventricular fibrillation, also called V fib 
V fib can cause all heart activity to suddenly stop, called sudden cardiac arrest 
V fib happens most often in people with heart disease or a prior heart attack 
PreventionPreventing ventricular tachycardia starts with keeping the heart in good shape 
If you have heart disease, get regular health checkups and follow your treatment plan 
Ask your healthcare team which exercises are safest for you 
Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other long term health conditions 
Other lifestyle changes also can help protect heart health and may prevent irregular heartbeats 
Stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine can increase the heart rate 
Always tell your healthcare team about all the medicines you take 
Have regular physical exams and report any new symptoms to your healthcare team 
Whether cancerous or not, a vertebral tumor can be life threatening and cause permanent disability 
Vertebral tumors are classified according to their location in the spine or vertebral column 
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that often metastasizes to the spine 
Tumors that begin in the bones of the spine primary tumors are far less common 
SymptomsVertebral tumors can cause different signs and symptoms, especially as tumors grow 
You have other systemic signs and symptoms of cancer, such as nausea, vomiting or dizziness 
Cancers of the bone, such as multiple myeloma, also may spread to the spine 
Vertebral tumors are also more common in people who have a prior history of cancer 
Vitiligo Overview Vitiligo vit ih LIE go is a disease that causes loss of skin color in patches 
The condition can affect the skin on any part of the body 
It can also affect hair and the inside of the mouth 
Normally, the color of hair and skin is determined by melanin 
Vitiligo occurs when cells that produce melanin die or stop functioning 
It can be stressful or make you feel bad about yourself 
Treatment for vitiligo may restore color to the affected skin 
But it doesn t prevent continued loss of skin color or a recurrence 
Premature whitening or graying of the hair on your scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows or beard 
With this type, called universal vitiligo, the discoloration affects nearly all skin surfaces 
In most cases, pigment loss spreads and eventually involves most of the skin 
It s unclear exactly what causes these pigment cells to fail or die 
Have frequent direct contact with phenol containing chemicals, such as those found in some detergents 
Complications People with vitiligo may be at increased risk of 
It happens when the nerve impulses to your voice box larynx are disrupted 
Vocal cord paralysis can make it hard to speak and even breathe 
That s because your vocal cords, also called vocal folds, do more than just produce sound 
Treatment for vocal cord paralysis usually involves surgery, and sometimes voice therapy 
When you speak, the bands come together and vibrate to make sound 
In most cases of vocal cord paralysis, only one vocal cord is paralyzed 
Paralysis of both of your vocal cords is a rare but serious condition 
This can cause difficulties with speech and significant problems with breathing and swallowing 
Health care providers often can t determine the exact cause of vocal cord paralysis 
There s some evidence that infection with COVID may cause vocal cord paralysis 
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of developing vocal cord paralysis include 
Aspiration that leads to severe pneumonia is rare but serious and requires immediate medical care 
Von Willebrand disease Symptoms causes Mayo Clinic 
But with treatment and self care, most people with this disease can lead active lives 
The most common sign of the condition is abnormal bleeding 
Excessive bleeding from an injury or after surgery or dental work 
Blood clots greater than inch centimeters in diameter in your menstrual flow 
The need to change your menstrual pad or tampon more than once an hour 
The need to use double sanitary protection for menstrual flow 
Symptoms of anemia, including tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath 
This interferes with the clotting process and can sometimes cause uncontrolled bleeding 
Factor VIII is involved in another inherited clotting disorder called hemophilia 
Parents pass the gene for the disease to their children 
Complications Rarely, von Willebrand disease can cause uncontrollable bleeding, which can be life threatening 
This can be a result of abnormal bleeding in the joints or soft tissue 
However, some people have long lasting neck pain and other complications 
SymptomsSymptoms of whiplash most often start within days of the injury 
Headaches, most often starting at the base of the skull 
Tenderness or pain in the shoulder, upper back or arms 
This often happens as a result of a rear end car crash 
This motion can cause damage to the muscles and tissues of the neck 
Risk factors Risk factors for whiplash include 
This is the most common risk factor for getting whiplash 
It s one of the injuries seen in shaken baby syndrome 
Football tackles and other sports related contact hits sometimes can cause whiplash 
Complications Most people who have whiplash feel better within a few weeks 
They don t seem to have lasting effects from the injury 
But some people have pain for months or years after the injury 
It s hard to predict how recovery from whiplash might go 
The following risk factors have been linked to a worse outcome 
olff Parkinson White WPW syndrome is a heart condition present at birth 
Using sunscreen every day and quitting smoking help prevent some wrinkling 
SymptomsWrinkles are the lines and creases that form in your skin 
Some wrinkles become deep and may be especially noticeable around the eyes, mouth and neck 
Causes Wrinkles are caused by several factors some you can control, others you can t 
This process results in the lines and creases typical of wrinkling 
It breaks down the elastin fibers and collagen in skin 
Without these supportive connective tissues, the skin loses strength and flexibility 
Facial movements and expressions lead to fine lines and wrinkles 
As skin ages, it loses its flexibility and can no longer spring back 
Avoid indoor tanning and limit the time you spend in the sun, especially midday 
Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least , even on cloudy days 
Dry skin shrivels plump skin cells, which can lead to fine lines and wrinkles 
Make it a habit to gently wash your face and moisturize it every day 
Moisturizers often have active ingredients that are intended to reduce fine lines and wrinkles 
Read the product labels for when and how to apply 
Products with retinol or retinoids are not for use when pregnant 
Another option you can buy without a prescription is adapalene Differin 
This is a vitamin A derived product that can help prevent fine lines and wrinkles 
There is some evidence that certain vitamins in your diet help protect the skin 
But females can carry the genes linked to the condition 
SymptomsMost babies with XLA appear healthy for the first few months 
They re protected by the proteins called antibodies they got from their mothers before birth 
When these antibodies leave their systems, the babies begin to get repeat bacterial infections 
Causes X linked agammaglobulinemia is caused by a change in a gene 
People with the condition can t produce proteins called antibodies that fight infection 
About of people with the condition have a family member who has it 
They should try to take part in regular activities for their ages 
But repeat infections linked to XLA will likely need careful watching and treatment 
Increased risk of central nervous system infections from live vaccines 
It was once thought that the yips were always associated with performance anxiety 
Risk factors The yips tend to be associated with 
Gastrin causes the stomach to produce too much acid, which leads to peptic ulcers 
High gastrin levels also can cause diarrhea, belly pain and other symptoms 
However, people usually find out they have it sometime between ages and 
Medicines to cut down stomach acid and heal the ulcers are the usual treatment 
Tell your provider if you ve been using nonprescription medicines to reduce stomach acid 
These include omeprazole Prilosec, Zegerid , cimetidine Tagamet HB or famotidine Pepcid AC 
These medicines may mask your symptoms, which could delay your diagnosis 
But the pattern of events that occurs in Zollinger Ellison syndrome typically follows the same sequence 
Insulin is the hormone that helps control your blood sugar, also called glucose 
Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum
