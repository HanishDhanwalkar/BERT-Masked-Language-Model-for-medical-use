Diagnosis You may not know you have atrial fibrillation AFib 
The condition may be found when a health checkup is done for another reason 
This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of the heart 
Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs 
Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which prints or displays the test results 
It s worn for a day or two while you do your regular activities 
Some devices automatically record when an irregular heart rhythm is detected 
This device records the heartbeat continuously for up to three years 
The device shows how the heart is beating while you do your daily activities 
It may be used to see how often you have an AFib episode 
For example, you may need one if you ve had an unexplained stroke Echocardiogram 
Sound waves are used to create images of the beating heart 
This test can show how blood flows through the heart and heart valves 
A chest X ray shows the condition of the lungs and heart

Together, you and your health care team discuss the best treatment option for you 
MedicationsTreatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines to do the following 
Most people need additional or alternative medicines, such as calcium channel blockers or beta blockers 
Also called anti arrhythmics, this type of medicine is used sparingly 
They tend to have more side effects than other medicines to control the heart rate 
Also called anticoagulants, these medicines help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of stroke 
Blood thinners include warfarin Jantoven , apixaban Eliquis , dabigatran Pradaxa , edoxaban Savaysa and rivaroxaban Xarelto 
Cardioversion is usually done in a hospital as a scheduled procedure 
The medicine reduces the risk of blood clots and strokes 
The heart s electrical signals can t pass through the damaged area 
So this treatment blocks the faulty heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation AFib 
Once the AV node is destroyed, a pacemaker is needed to control the heart rhythm 
Cardiac ablation often uses heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart 
The scars disrupt irregular heart signals and restore a typical heartbeat 
Sensors on the tip of the catheter apply the cold or heat energy 
Less commonly, ablation is done using a scalpel during open heart surgery 
So the maze interferes with the stray heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation 
If a scalpel is used to create the maze pattern, open heart surgery is necessary 
This is a treatment for some types of continued atrial fibrillation 
The scar tissue blocks faulty electrical signals that cause AFib 
If this happens, another ablation or heart treatment may be recommended 
After cardiac ablation, lifelong blood thinners may be needed to prevent strokes 
This sac, called an appendage, is where most AFib related clots form 
A closure device is gently guided through a catheter to the sac 
Once the device is in place, the catheter is removed 
Try to get to minutes of physical activity most days of the week 
If you need help quitting, talk to your health care team 
Talk with your care provider to set realistic goals for weight 
Get your blood pressure checked at least every two years if you re and older 
If you have high blood pressure, follow your treatment plan as directed 
Ask your health care team how often you need a cholesterol test 
Lifestyle changes and medicines may be recommended to control high cholesterol 
In some people, even lower amounts of alcohol can trigger AFib 
Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions 
Adults should aim to get to hours of sleep daily 
Tell your health care team if your AFib symptoms get worse 
If AFib is found early, treatment may be easier, and it may work better 
You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases 
Here s some Information to help you prepare for your appointment 
Write down any symptoms you re having, including any that may seem unrelated to atrial fibrillation 
Note when they started, and what you were doing when they started 
Someone who goes with you can help you remember Information you re given 
For atrial fibrillation, some basic questions to ask your doctor include 
What are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition 
Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you re prescribing 
Are there any other restrictions that I need to follow 
How often should I be screened for heart disease or complications of AFib 
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me 
Don t hesitate to ask any other questions during your appointment 
What to expect from your doctorDuring a health checkup, you are usually asked many questions 
Do you always have symptoms, or do they come and go 
A healthy lifestyle is the main protection against heart problems and heart related complications 
This is the most common test to diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms 
This test uses X rays to create cross sectional images of the structures inside the belly area 
This test also can detect the size and shape of an aneurysm 
Women who have never smoked generally don t need to be screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm 
Ask your health care provider if screening is right for you 
The goal of abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment is to prevent an aneurysm from rupturing 
Frequent health checkups and imaging, called medical monitoring or watchful waiting 
Abdominal ultrasounds also should be done at regular follow up appointments 
This treatment is most often used to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm 
The mesh tube, called a graft, expands, and strengthens the weakened area of the aorta 
Endovascular surgery isn t an option for everyone with an abdominal aortic aneurysm 
You and your health care team should discuss the best repair option for you 
Long term survival rates are similar for both endovascular surgery and open surgery 
These activities may cause extreme increases in blood pressure, which can worsen an aneurysm 
If you re feeling stressed or anxious, let your care provider know 
Together you can come up with the best treatment plan 
Here s some Information to help you get ready for your appointment 
Important personal Information, including a family history of heart disease or aneurysms 
For an abdominal aortic aneurysm, questions to ask your health care provider include 
Which do you think would be the best treatment for me 
Do I need regular screenings, and if so, how often 
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have 
Do your symptoms come and go, or do you always feel them 
Two such tests are an iodine starch test and a sweat test 
Treatment Treating hyperhidrosis may start with treating the condition causing it 
If a cause isn t found, treatment focuses on controlling heavy sweating 
Even if your sweating improves after treatment, it may recur 
Your health care provider may prescribe an antiperspirant with aluminum chloride Drysol, Xerac AC 
Talk with your health care provider about ways to reduce side effects 
Prescription creams that contain glycopyrrolate may help hyperhidrosis that affects the face and head 
Wipes soaked in glycopyrronium tosylate Qbrexza may ease symptoms of the hands, feet and underarms 
Possible side effects of these products include mild skin irritation and dry mouth 
Some pills oral medications block the nerves that trigger sweat glands
